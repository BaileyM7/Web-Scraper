“Trends across our markets remain robust, and our backlog and pipeline are at record levels, characterized by a highly diverse mix of clients and sectors,” said Troy Rudd, AECOM’s chief executive officer. “As a result, we delivered strong performance in the first quarter and raised our guidance for the full year. Importantly, we are investing to extend our advantages. This includes key hires and growth investments to support the Water & Environment Advisory business as we continue to expand our addressable market of higher-value infrastructure professional services.” 

“The benefits of our  Think and Act Globally  strategy are evident in our high win rates and record backlog,” said Lara Poloni, AECOM’s president. “We are seeing positive proof points that reinforce our investment in our new Water and Environment Advisory business. We have already made several key hires, and as the number one water, environment, facilities and transportation firm as ranked by ENR, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of doubling the $200 million of net service revenue in this business over the next three years.” 

“We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2025 with first quarter results that exceeded our expectations,” said Gaurav Kapoor, AECOM’s chief financial and operations officer. “This includes accelerating NSR growth, record first quarter margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. As we look ahead, continued expected growth and the high return on our strategic investments underpin our confidence in delivering a 17% margin exit rate by the end of fiscal 2026 and even higher margins over time. Importantly, our balance sheet remains strong and we delivered a 28% increase in free cash flow, which supported continued returns of capital to our shareholders under our returns-based capital allocation policy.” 

First Quarter Highlights 

  * Revenue increased by 3%; net service revenue  2  increased by 5.5%, highlighted by 9% growth in the Americas design business. 
  * Operating income increased by 46%; the segment adjusted  1  operating margin  3  increased by 40 basis points to 15.4% and the adjusted  1  EBITDA margin  5  increased by 20 basis points to 15.6%, both of which set first quarter records. 
  * Net income increased by 83%; adjusted  1  EBITDA  4  increased by 8% and adjusted  1  EPS increased by 25%. 
  * Free cash flow increased by 28%, and the Company returned $55 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
  * Total backlog  7  increased by 4% to a record high, driven by a 1.2x book-to-burn  8  ratio in each of the Americas and International design businesses, contributing to a 1.1x book-to-burn ratio enterprise wide. 
    * The Company’s pipeline of opportunities increased to a new record and included double-digit growth in later stage opportunities with award decisions over the next several quarters. 
    * Americas design backlog increased by 7% and is also at a record high. 



Financial Guidance 

  * AECOM  raised its adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2025, which includes expectations to deliver record net service revenue and profitability, margins and continued strong cash flow conversion in fiscal 2025; the Company expects: 
    * Organic NSR  2  growth of 5% to 8%. 
    * Adjusted  1  EBITDA  4  of between $1,175 million and $1,210 million, up 9% at the mid-point. 
    * Adjusted  1  EPS of between $5.05 and $5.20, up 13% at the mid-point. 
    * 30 basis points of both segment adjusted  1  operating margin  3  and adjusted EBITDA margin  5  expansion to 16.1% and 16.3%, respectively. 
    * 100%+ free cash flow  6  conversion. 
  * Other assumptions incorporated into fiscal 2025 guidance: 
    * An average fully diluted share count of 134 million, which reflects only shares repurchased to-date. 
    * An adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24% for the full year. 
  * See the Regulation G Information tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 



Business Segments 

Americas 

Revenue in the first quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. Net service revenue  2  was $1.1 billion, an 8% increase from the prior year. This performance was driven by 9% growth in the design business and reflected strong growth in both the U.S. and Canada, resulting from the ongoing multi-decade secular growth drivers of investments in infrastructure, sustainability, resilience and energy. 

Operating income increased by 12% to $196 million and on an adjusted  1  basis increased by 10% to $197 million. The adjusted operating margin on net service revenue increased by 40 basis points over the prior year to 18.7%, a new first quarter high, reflecting high-returning organic growth initiatives and strong execution. Expanding margins continue to enable growing investments in AI, digital and new growth platforms, including the Water & Environment Advisory business. 

Backlog in the Americas segment is at a record high, driven by strong wins in the quarter that resulted in a 1.1x book-to-burn ratio  8  , including a 1.2x book-to-burn ratio in the design business. 

International 

Revenue in the first quarter was $902 million, a 5% increase from the prior year. Net service revenue  2  was $750 million, a 2% increase from the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K. and Middle East markets, supported by a strong backlog and leading positions on key frameworks. However, this growth was partially offset by a decline in Australia. 

Both operating income and adjusted  1  operating income increased by 5% to $81 million. The adjusted operating margin on net service revenue increased by 20 basis points over the prior year to 10.8%, which reflected strong execution and the Company’s focus on high-returning markets and opportunities across its largest geographies. 

Backlog in the International segment remains near a record high, reflecting a 1.2x book-to-burn ratio  8  in the quarter. 

Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation Update 

The Company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including net leverage  9  of 0.8x. During the quarter, the Company returned $55 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividend payments. Since the initiation of its repurchase program in September 2020, the Company has repurchased more than $2.2 billion of stock, which represents approximately one-third of the Company’s market capitalization at the time it began repurchases. 

Tax Rate 

The effective tax rate was 13.4% in the first quarter. On an adjusted  1  basis, the effective tax rate was 14.3%. The lower tax rate primarily related to the timing of the realization of deferred tax assets in the first quarter. The Company continues to expect a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. The adjusted tax rate was derived by re-computing the quarterly effective tax rate on adjusted net income  10  . The adjusted tax expense differs from the GAAP tax expense based on the taxability or deductibility and tax rate applied to each of the adjustments.

Forward-Looking Statements 

All statements in this communication other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, profitability, strategic value creation, capital allocation strategy including stock repurchases, risk profile and investment strategies, and any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, and the expected financial and operational results of  AECOM  . Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our business is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and client spending reductions; potential government shutdowns, changes in administration or other funding directives and circumstances that may cause governmental agencies to modify, curtail or terminate our contracts; losses under fixed-price contracts; limited control over operations that run through our joint venture entities; liability for misconduct by our employees or consultants; changes in government laws, regulations and policies, including failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business; maintaining adequate surety and financial capacity; potential high leverage and inability to service our debt and guarantees; ability to continue payment of dividends; exposure to political and economic risks in different countries, including tariffs and trade policies, geopolitical events, and conflicts; inflation, currency exchange rates and interest rate fluctuations; changes in capital markets and stock market volatility; retaining and recruiting key technical and management personnel; legal claims and litigation; inadequate insurance coverage; environmental law compliance and adequate nuclear indemnification; unexpected adjustments and cancellations related to our backlog; partners and third parties who may fail to satisfy their legal obligations; managing pension costs;  AECOM Capital  real estate development projects; cybersecurity issues, IT outages and data privacy; risks associated with the benefits and costs of the sale of our Management Services and self-perform at-risk civil infrastructure, power construction and oil and gas businesses, including the risk that any purchase adjustments from those transactions could be unfavorable and result in any future proceeds owed to us as part of the transactions could be lower than we expect; as well as other additional risks and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements set forth in our reports filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission  . Any forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. 

Non-GAAP Financial Information 

This communication contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net/operating income, segment adjusted operating margin, adjusted tax rate, net service revenue and free cash flow provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to exclude the impact of certain items, such as amortization expense and taxes to aid investors in better understanding our core performance results. We use free cash flow to present the cash generated from operations after capital expenditures to maintain our business. We present net service revenue (NSR) to exclude pass-through subcontractor costs from revenue to provide investors with a better understanding of our operational performance. We present segment adjusted operating margin to reflect segment operating performance of our Americas and International segments, excluding  AECOM Capital  . We present adjusted tax rate to reflect the tax rate on adjusted earnings. We also use constant-currency growth rates where appropriate, which are calculated by conforming the current period results to the comparable period exchange rates. 

Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is found in the Regulation G Information tables at the back of this communication. The Company is unable to reconcile certain of its non-GAAP financial guidance and long-term financial targets due to uncertainties in these non-operating items as well as other adjustments to net income. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of its guidance for NSR to GAAP revenue because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty its pass-through revenue.

11:29:44 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-21
11:29:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: HONG KONG  (January 21, 2025) — AECOM, the trusted global infrastructure leader, today announced it has been selected by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of the HKSAR Government to deliver the Investigation Study for Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park (SPS WCP). Spanning 348 hectares, the SPS WCP is the first WCP to be established under the WCPs System proposed under the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy released in 2021, with the WCPs System aiming to conserve the wetlands with ecological values in the Deep Bay, increase environmental capacity for the Northern Metropolis, and achieve co-existence of conservation and development. 

AECOM will provide comprehensive services for the investigation stage of the SPS WCP, including preliminary design, engineering infrastructure works, wetland enhancement, landscaping, environmental sustainability integration, digital monitoring, and park management. The establishment of the SPS WCP shall enhance the ecological quality and biodiversity of the Northern Metropolis, provide high-quality outdoor eco-education and eco-recreational facilities to the public, as well as introduce modernized and sustainable aquaculture into the WCP. 

“We are honored to contribute to this pioneering project within the Northern Metropolis,” said Simon Wong, vice president of AECOM’s Land Supply/Municipal Division in Hong Kong. “Bringing together the expertise of our ecologists, scientists, engineers and designers, along with internationally respected consultants from various disciplines, we look forward to creating a WCP that contributes to transforming Hong Kong’s New Territories North into a nature-positive Northern Metropolis. Through this collaboration with CEDD and AFCD, we will showcase biodiversity and aquaculture in harmony in the SPS WCP and the wide range of benefits that nature-based solutions (NbS) can offer.” 

Drawing on the success of the recently opened Long Valley Nature Park, which also adopts NbS to help promote urban-rural-nature integration, the SPS WCP is poised to become one of the best international models of sustainable development. The park underscores the value of the Northern Metropolis development by seizing opportunities for advancements in biodiversity, aquaculture, eco-education, eco-recreation, park management and funding arrangement. 

The SPS WCP plays a central role in maintaining ecological balance, with a strategy focused on enhancing ecological function and capacity. The park will adopt a sustainable management and operation model that encourages cross-sector collaboration and maximizes conservation efforts and aquaculture development with financial returns. Innovative digital technologies from global and Mainland China, such as camera traps, bioacoustics, e-DNA, AI, and IoT monitoring tools, will also be deployed to enhance project outcomes. 

The phased development of the SPS WCP will begin with the conservation of fishponds and wetlands in the northern part of the WCP, crucial for maintaining the core bird flight path. Upon completion, the park will provide diverse wetland habitats essential for migratory waterbirds, including globally threatened species such as the Black-faced Spoonbill, and other important species like the Eurasian otter.

11:29:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: New Terminal Considered One of the Most Important Infrastructure Projects in United States 

NEW YORK  (January 14, 2025) — AECOM Tishman, one of the nation’s leading builders for over 125 years, has been selected by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) as the construction manager for the Dyer Avenue deck-overs project. These are the first contracts associated with the Midtown Bus Terminal replacement project, which is considered one of the most important infrastructure projects in the United States today. The new deck-overs will allow for the staging of buses during the larger construction project before ultimately being transformed into 3.5 acres of new publicly accessible open green space once the construction of the new bus terminal is complete. 

“For more than a century, AECOM Tishman has managed the construction of some of New York’s most iconic infrastructure projects, and we are proud to have been selected to assist the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey with the first piece of the Midtown Bus Terminal replacement project,” said Eric Reid, PE, Chief Operating Officer, AECOM Tishman. “We have been honored to support the vision of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for more than five decades, and we are grateful for the opportunity to play a role in the delivery of this once-in-a-generation project that will improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of commuters and enhance the surrounding community.” 

In late July, the PANYNJ’s Board of Commissioners authorized the contracts to construct the $271 million Dyer Avenue deck-overs – the first construction contracts associated with the new bus terminal. The Dyer Avenue deck-overs project encompasses the construction of two decks over below-grade portions of Dyer Avenue and the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway between West 37th and West 38th Streets and between West 38th and West 39th Streets. 

As the world’s busiest bus terminal, the new facility will replace the existing 73-year-old, functionally obsolete terminal with a world-class facility that is critical to the interconnected economies of New York and New Jersey. Facilitating reliable and efficient bus service, the new terminal project will feature a new 2.1 million square-foot main terminal, a separate storage and staging building and new ramps leading directly into and out of the Lincoln Tunnel. The new terminal is designed to meet projected 2040-2050 commuter growth, provide a best-in-class customer experience that serves the region’s 21st century public transportation needs and improve the quality of life of the surrounding community.
