09:49:33 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
09:49:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—In response to the  Supreme Court decision  today in  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland  to uphold the law that would ban TikTok, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the leading think tank for science and technology policy, released the following statement from Vice President  Daniel Castro  : 

> Following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ban, TikTok’s fate now lies with President-elect Trump and Congress. However, the debate around restricting TikTok is like focusing on a single tree while ignoring the whole forest. By singling out one app, policymakers are missing the larger issue: A digital ecosystem where Chinese-owned apps operate freely in the United States, even as American apps are systematically blocked in China. While it is possible to mitigate security threats from individual Chinese-owned apps on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. urgently needs a coherent economic policy to address the deeper imbalance in digital market access. 

> The narrow focus on TikTok has distracted from the need for the United States to develop a consistent and comprehensive policy to address broader economic risks from one-sided market access by Chinese tech companies. It’s troubling that policymakers only seem willing to act against China in the techno-economic space by invoking security threats or human rights abuses when they should instead be willing to directly address the systematic economic mercantilism and lack of reciprocity that define the current digital market. 

> To truly protect U.S. interests, policymakers should turn the page on the debate over TikTok, examine the entire framework of Chinese digital engagement, and demand a fair and reciprocal digital playing field.

09:49:34 root         DEBUG    Desc: LONDON—In response to the release of the highly anticipated  UK AI Opportunities Action Plan  , the Center for Data Innovation issued the following statement from Ayesha Bhatti, Head of Digital Policy, UK & EU: 

> The new plan sets a clear vision for how the UK government should use AI to revitalise the economy and advance the UK’s global leadership in AI. By embracing all 50 of the plan’s recommendations, the government demonstrates it is fully committed to delivering an AI-driven economy. So far, the UK has made several missteps on AI, including an excessive focus on AI safety and cuts to critical AI funding. These recommendations are a welcome and much-needed shift. If the government can deliver on these recommendations promptly and consistently, the UK will be on track to become a global AI powerhouse.

09:49:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
09:49:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—In response to the Biden administration’s Bureau of Industry and Security releasing an Interim Final Rule (IFR) establishing an “  Export Control Framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Diffusion  ,” the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the leading think tank for science and technology policy, released the following statement from Vice President  Daniel Castro  : 

> The Interim Final Rule (IFR) raises serious concerns about its potential impact on U.S. competitiveness, global AI leadership, and international alliances. By pressuring other nations to choose between the United States and China, the administration risks alienating key partners and inadvertently strengthening China’s position in the global AI ecosystem. Confronted with such an ultimatum, many countries may opt for the side offering them uninterrupted access to the AI technologies vital for their economic growth and digital futures—and currently, only one country is threatening to cut them off from these technologies. 

> Moreover, the IFR’s narrow focus on regulating closed-weight AI models, while leaving open-weight equivalents unaddressed, creates a glaring and counterproductive imbalance. U.S. companies developing proprietary AI models will face stringent regulatory burdens that foreign competitors can evade by leveraging open-source alternatives. This policy undercuts American firms in the global market and fails to meaningfully mitigate the risks the regulation purports to address. Instead of bolstering national security or safeguarding US technological leadership, the administration’s approach risks enabling rivals to accelerate their advancements and surpass the United States in this crucial domain. 

> The solution is not to further restrict access to AI chips or models but to reassess the current strategy. Future policies should prioritize enhancing U.S. competitiveness in AI by: 

> Expanding market access  for U.S. chips and AI technologies to secure a dominant global market share for American firms. 

> Countering geostrategic competitors  like China and Russia, which are actively forming alliances such as the BRICS AI Alliance to provide their partners with access to critical AI resources. 

> Focusing on the majority of lawful and beneficial AI applications  , rather than disproportionately restricting their export. 

> Recognizing the economic implications of chip sourcing decisions  , as every dollar spent on Chinese-made chips, instead of American chips, shifts revenue from U.S. R&D to China, diminishing the competitiveness of American companies. 

> The administration’s initial restrictions on chip exports were misguided, and the IFR compounds this misstep. Instead of correcting course, the administration persists with counterproductive policies that undermine U.S. leadership in AI while granting rivals a clearer path to dominance. The United States should be working to solidify its position as the global leader in AI by fostering innovation, strengthening alliances, and ensuring the broad availability of U.S. technology to legitimate users worldwide. A strategy rooted in competitiveness—not containment—will best serve America’s interests in the digital economy of the future.

09:49:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-09
09:49:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—Ahead of the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments for  TikTok v. Garland  , the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the leading think tank for science and technology policy, issued the following statement from Senior Policy Manager Ash Johnson: 

> A TikTok ban would hurt American businesses and consumers more than TikTok itself ever has. Such a ban would impact the millions of American content creators who use the platform to reach an audience as a hobby, a side hustle, or a primary source of income. It would hurt thousands of American businesses that use the social network to market their products and services. And it would harm the millions of American users of all ages who use the app for entertainment, education, news, and more. 

> TikTok is not a national security threat. The ban will not prevent foreign election interference or halt the spread of misinformation online. Any foreign government can spread misinformation on any social network and claims that TikTok manipulates its algorithm to promote Chinese interests are still only speculation. TikTok does not collect particularly sensitive data, and if the United States is concerned about Chinese apps having access to Americans’ data, then it should ban all Chinese apps. 

> The Supreme Court should carefully consider whether banning an app that millions of Americans use every day for communication, creative expression, entertainment, and news will cause more harm than good. The United States has always supported a free and open Internet, unlike many of our foreign counterparts that enforce arbitrary measures to block politically unpopular content. Changing that course would set a dangerous precedent, not only domestically but for other countries that might follow in our footsteps.

09:49:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: OTTAWA—Following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing his resignation as Liberal Party leader and prime minister, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the leading think tank for science and technology policy, released the following statement from Robert D. Atkinson, president of ITIF, and Lawrence Zhang, head of policy at ITIF’s Centre for Canadian Innovation and Competitiveness: 

> With the upcoming Liberal Party leadership race as well as an impending federal election this year, it is essential for Canada’s policymakers to prioritize technology, innovation, and productivity. 

> Canada’s techno-economic position today is fundamentally different from when Justin Trudeau was elected the country's prime minister nine years ago. Canada now faces a future of becoming a stagnant, middle-income country that specializes in natural resource extraction. This fate will reduce wage growth, economic mobility, and access to high-quality jobs in advanced industries for Canadians. 

> Canada must chart a radically new course that recognizes its severe structural weakness in international competitiveness and productivity. While it may be late in the game, it is not too late to redirect Canada’s techno-economic performance. Bold leadership and innovative policies can make a difference. 

> The Centre for Canadian Innovation and Competitiveness’s  recommendations for the next federal government  is a key place for all parties to start: 

  1. Establish a productivity commissioner. 
  2. Improve tax incentives for innovation. 
  3. Introduce a time-limited tax credit for capital investment. 
  4. Make Canadian colleges and universities engines of R&D commercialization. 
  5. Create three or four “Manufacturing Canada” institutes. 
  6. Develop an innovation-friendly regulatory system. 
  7. Pursue regulatory interoperability with Canadian trade partners. 
  8. Set robust artificial intelligence (AI) adoption milestones for the federal government. 
  9. Build an independent Canada Innovation Agency. 
  10. Pilot a federal IT procurement innovation testbed. 



> If implemented as described in our  growth agenda  , these policies will help turbocharge the economy and make Canada more innovative, productive, and globally competitive for generations to come.
