10:34:22 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:34:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA), Congressman Wesley Hunt (R-TX), and Congressman Randy Weber (R-TX) introduced H.R. 513, the  Offshore Lands Authorities Act  , which overturns Biden’s recent offshore drilling ban and creates a new process for withdrawals for future leasing determinations. 

“For decades, Democrats have opposed the American oil and gas industry. Their policies have increased costs for our families and threatened American energy jobs. The disastrous term of Biden is over, and his drilling ban will not stand. Our legislation protects American energy production, restores Congressional oversight, and places guardrails on future land withdrawals,”  said Congressman Higgins  . 

“For the past four years, Biden has crushed Americans’ access to affordable, abundant energy. This legislation blocks Biden’s last attempt to destroy offshore oil and gas production. With President Trump’s mandate to Make America Great Again, Congress must lead—and this is just the beginning,”  said Congressman Hunt  . 

“From day one, Joe Biden has been on a crusade to kill offshore oil and gas, ignoring the livelihoods and energy needs of hardworking Americans. Now, in the eleventh hour, he’s digging in his heels, shoving an offshore oil ban down the throats of the American people—people who have made it crystal clear they reject this administration’s full-throttle assault on affordable, reliable energy. Enabling President Trump authority to reverse Biden’s reckless policies is not just a necessity—it’s essential for restoring America’s energy strength and securing our future,”  said Congressman Weber  . 

“Our nation’s vast offshore resources are a critical source of affordable energy, government revenue and stability around the world. We applaud Rep. Higgins for introducing legislation to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.” –  API Vice President of Upstream Policy Holly Hopkins 

“We thank Congressman Higgins for championing a strategic approach towards our nation’s offshore energy resources. Nullifying politically motivated withdrawals from President Biden and establishing clear boundaries on future executive actions concerning unleased offshore areas reinforces Congressional oversight over America’s energy destiny. The stipulation that significant withdrawals require Congressional approval ensures that such decisions reflect the will of the people through their elected representatives, rather than being subject to the political whims of executive policy. This bill safeguards our ability to responsibly develop these resources, if the need should ever arise, which is vital for our national security, economic prosperity, and energy independence.”  – Erik Milito, President, National Ocean Industries Association 

Representatives Tim Burchett (R-TN), Jefferson Shreve (R-IN), Dan Meuser (R-PA), Jodey Arrington (R-TX), Carol Miller (R-WV), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Josh Brecheen (R-OK), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), Scott Perry (R-PA), Tom Tiffany (R-WI), Mary Miller (R-IL), Andy Ogles (R-TN), Eric Burlison (R-MO), Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Andy Harris (R-MD), Barry Moore (R-AL) are also original co-sponsors of the legislation. 

The Offshore Lands Authorities Act would: 

  * Revoke previous presidential memoranda and executive orders that removed 625 million acres for offshore energy development. 
  * Limit withdrawals to under 100,000 acres in total or contiguous with any other withdrawal and set an expiration after 20 years. 
  * Requires geological, economic, and security assessments for future withdrawals. 
  * Requires Congressional approval if a President cumulatively withdraws more than 500,000 acres. 
  * Make withdrawals subject to a Congressional Review Act (CRA) like mechanism, giving Congress the authority to review and potentially overturn future withdrawals. 
  * Provide stability and predictability for energy producers by ensuring future withdrawals do not contradict an approved Five-Year Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

10:34:23 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – During a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing, Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA) blasted the Social Security Administration (SSA) for its lack of responsive service to America’s elders. 

Congressman Higgins called the SSA helpline during the hearing, stayed on hold for an hour and a half without being able to speak to an employee, and highlighted the failure of Democrats’ enhanced telework policies for federal bureaucrats.

“One of the benefits of having other committee obligations and arriving at Oversight Committee behind my colleague is that I get to listen to all the testimony. Mr. Chairman, this is Social Security *holds up phone* for one hour, 28-minutes, 25 seconds. The phone number is 800-772-1213. That’s the number for Social Security. *continues holding up phone* 

“This is what our elders have to listen to. The reason our elders call for help is because they need help, not because they want to listen to elevator music. They want to talk to a human being. The first five minutes of this hour and a half, Mr. Chairman, was instructions to get to various websites, which our elders have difficulty doing. I have difficulty doing it. Our elders are frequently confused and alone and scared. They don’t have like laptops and apps and things. They have a telephone. They want to talk to a human being. 

“Well, wait, they have a local Social Security office they could go to right now. That’s a historical model. No, I give you exhibit B…From your website, listen to this. America, pay attention to what’s happening to our elders. If you need in-person help, you must first make an appointment, and you make an appointment on the telephone. You know who answers the phone? Nobody.”

10:34:24 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA) voted to pass H.R. 28, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  , which prevents biological males from competing against biological females in women’s sports. 

This legislation clarifies that a recipient of federal education funding must adhere to the well-established Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Established 53 years ago, Title IX was intended to provide women and girls with equal education opportunities by preventing discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding. Last year, the Biden Administration  released a rule  amending Title IX and imposing radical gender ideology on K-12 schools and public universities. 

“Men should not compete in women’s sports,”  said Congressman Higgins  . “This bill affirms Title IX’s original intent and protects women’s sports from the left’s radical gender ideology. We must protect our basic, fundamental American values, including fair play.”

WASHINGTON, DC  – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, pressed Doug Burgum, President-elect Trump’s nominee to be Secretary of the Interior, in his confirmation hearing on his intent to expand oil and gas drilling on a massive scale—at Trump’s request—which will lead to increased burning of fossil fuels, as well as his commitment to implement the  new Compacts of Free Association  (COFA). If confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Burgum would be responsible for managing 700 million acres of underground minerals, over 480 million acres of public lands, including nearly 400 national parks and monuments, as well as countless dams and reservoirs. 

Senator Hirono began with two questions related to sexual misconduct, which she has  asked every nominee since 2018  . She then pressed Mr. Burgum on his comments that President-elect Trump’s “energy dominance vision” will end wars abroad. 

“President Trump has directed you to expand oil and gas drilling on a massive scale, which will lead to increased burning of fossil fuels,”  said Senator Hirono during the exchange.  “The fact of the matter is that you have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue, and for you to take the position that you are going to engage in actions that will result in the burning of more fossil fuel—it’s troubling.” 

In addition to being nominated to lead the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), President-elect Trump has also tapped Mr. Burgum to be his  “energy czar”  on Trump’s new “National Energy Council” with a seat on the National Security Council, giving Mr. Burgum power to significantly influence the country’s policies on energy production and regulation. 

During her line of inquiry, Senator Hirono also asked Mr. Burgum to reaffirm his commitment to prioritize DOI’s mission over his loyalty to President-elect Trump. 

“As Secretary of the Interior, it is your duty to see that the department carries out its mission: to protect and manage our national—our nation's natural resources and cultural heritage,”  said Senator Hirono.  “We all know that the President wants to ‘drill, baby drill.’” 

“So I would ask you that, should you be confirmed, that you will have these kinds of matters that you'll have to decide,”  continued Senator Hirono.  “Are you going to drill in a monument? Are you going to protect our natural resources?  Or are you going to ‘drill, baby drill?’” 

Senator Hirono then asked Mr. Burgum for his commitment to implement the new Compacts of Free Association—which falls under the purview of DOI—in accordance with the law that was enacted in 2024. 

The full transcript of Senator Hirono’s exchange with Mr. Burgum is available below. Video of Senator Hirono’s question line can be found  here  . 

Sen. Hirono:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome. As part of my responsibilities to ensure the fitness of nominees before any of the committees on which I sit, I ask the following two initial questions. First is, since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? 

Mr. Burgum:  No, senator. I have not. 

Sen. Hirono:  Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct? 

Mr. Burgum:  I have not. 

Sen. Hirono:  We received your testimony late yesterday and you noted that “President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end wars abroad.” President Trump has directed you to expand oil and gas drilling on a massive scale, which will lead to increased burning of fossil fuels. Now, the scientific consensus is that burning fossil fuels is a primary human cause of climate change. 

In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, appointed by then-President Trump, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating.” In 2014, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that “climate change is a critical national security threat and a threat multiplier.” 

Now, these are two Secretaries of Defense—they know something about war. Were you aware that they testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on a number of times that burning more fossil fuel is actually going to not result in the end of wars but could very well exacerbate and cause wars? Were you aware of this testimony? 

Mr. Burgum:  Senator, no. I am not aware of that specific testimony. But, I do know that within fossil fuels the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emissions at the same time. 

Sen. Hirono:  Well, the fact of the matter is that you have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue. And for you to take the position that you are going to engage in actions that will result in the burning of more fossil fuel—it’s troubling. 

As Secretary of the Interior, it is your duty to see that the department carries out its mission: to protect and manage our national—our nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. If you are ordered by the President to act in a manner that is counter to the department’s mission or to the Constitution, such as drilling in Bear[s] Ears National Monument, will you do as the President asks? Because he wants to drill in that monument. 

Mr. Burgum:  Senator, of course, as part of my sworn duty I will follow the law and follow the Constitution, and so you can count on that. And I have not heard of any— 

Sen. Hirono:  Well— 

Mr. Burgum:  —anything about President Trump wanting to do anything— 

Sen. Hirono:  Well he certainly wants to— 

Mr. Burgum:  —other than advancing energy production for the benefit of the American people in a legal way. 

Sen. Hirono:  We all know that the President wants to “drill, baby drill.” And in your testimony you say that he has an energy dominance vision. 

So I would ask you that, should you be confirmed, that you will have these kinds of matters that you'll have to decide. Are you going to drill in a monument? Are you going to protect our natural resources? 

Mr. Burgum:  I— 

Sen. Hirono:  Or are you going to “drill, baby drill?” So, I raise that as a concern with you going forward. 

Compacts of Free Association—last year, Congress renewed our Compacts of Free Association and that comes within the purview of Interior. It involves Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. I would like to get your commitment to implement the new Compacts of Free Association in accordance with the bipartisan law that was enacted last year. 

Mr. Burgum:  Well, senator these Pacific islands, in addition to the three that you mentioned that are part of the Compact—but also the others that are under the insulars of the Interior—are all critically important to national security for the United States of America. All of them have important military implications. All of these are places where U.S. sailors fought and died during World War II. And with the aggression that China is showing in the Pacific, it’s more important that we support them more than ever. I know that Hawaii plays an important role, including in things like with medical care for those residents of those islands and I think it is important that the federal government does its share as opposed to putting the load on the state. 

Sen. Hirono:  Thank you. It sounds as though you have familiarity with the Compacts, for which I am gratified. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:34:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and 19 Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution honoring the service of women in combat roles in the U.S. Armed Forces. The resolution comes as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense (DOD), Pete Hegseth, continues to face scorching criticism for, among many other things, his  long  record  of  denigrating  women  servicemembers who bravely serve our nation in combat roles. Earlier this week at his confirmation hearing,  Senator Hirono pressed Mr. Hegseth  on numerous reports of personal misconduct, sexual assault, and whether he will be loyal to the Constitution or Donald Trump. 

“Thousands of brave women serve in our armed forces, making the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, protect our national security, and keep us safe,”  said Senator Hirono.  “Pete Hegseth lacks the understanding of how crucial these women are to our military. Our female servicemembers deserve a Secretary of Defense who does not undermine and disparage them or their contributions. I am proud to cosponsor this important resolution to honor every woman who serves our nation in combat roles.” 

The resolution “recognizes the contribution, bravery, and sacrifices of women serving in combat roles in the Armed Forces; and encourages the continued celebration of the achievements of women in the Armed Forces to inspire future generations,” noting specifically that: 

  * Women have honorably served in the Armed Services with distinction since the Revolutionary War; 
  * The DOD announced the opening of all military occupations and specialties to women in December 2015; 
  * Women have received numerous commendations for their service in combat after September 2001, including Silver Stars and Bronze Stars; 
  * Since September 11, 2001, approximately 3,000 women have earned Combat Action Badges and Combat Action Ribbons; and 
  * Women in the military serve in special forces units, including as Army Rangers, Air Force Special Operators, and in the Marine Corps Special Operations Command. 



In addition to Senators Hirono, Murray, and Duckworth, Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) cosponsored the resolution.

WASHINGTON, DC  – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, pressed Chris Wright, President-elect Trump’s nominee to be Secretary of Energy, on his potential conflicts of interest and his commitment to engage in vigorous oversight of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s project funding at Wright’s confirmation hearing. As Secretary of Energy, Mr. Wright—a multi-millionaire currently serving as CEO of Liberty Energy, the second largest oil and gas hydraulic fracturing company in the U.S.—would be responsible for overseeing the country’s nuclear infrastructure and implementing the department’s energy policies. 

Senator Hirono began with two questions related to sexual misconduct, which she has  asked every nominee since 2018  . After discussing the devastation caused by the recent Los Angeles wildfires, as well as the Maui wildfires in 2023, Senator Hirono asked Mr. Wright about the need for improvements to Maui’s electrical grid in order to reduce the risks of wildfires and ensure reliable access to power for residents. 

“As we see these kinds of natural disasters, I think states and municipalities will need help from the DOE,”  said Senator Hirono. 

In 2023, Hawaiian Electric  received a $95 million award  through the Biden-Harris administration’s  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  (IIJA) to help rebuild Maui’s electrical grid. Senator Hirono pressed Mr. Wright on his commitment to continue allocating funding for grid improvements with the new incoming administration. The IIJA also requires that all construction and repair projects funded by the DOE pay prevailing wages, effectively creating hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. Senator Hirono asked Mr. Wright to commit to upholding those labor standards and paying workers a fair wage. 

Senator Hirono then questioned Mr. Wright about a  dinner hosted by President-elect Trump  at Mar-a-Lago in April 2024. 

“The Washington Post reported in April 2024 that Donald Trump told a group of about 24 oil executives at Mar-a-Lago that they should raise $1 billion for his campaign, which would be a ‘deal,’ given his commitment to reversing environmental regulations, expanding oil and gas leasing on federal land, and approval of natural gas exports,”  said Senator Hirono. 

When pressed by Senator Hirono about whether he thought it was appropriate for President-elect Trump to offer such a deal,  Mr. Wright denied that any such offer was made. However, following the April 2024 dinner, Mr. Wright donated more than $273,000 and his wife co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump to  help him win re-election. 

Senator Hirono then asked Mr. Wright to reaffirm his commitment to engage in vigorous oversight of the DOE’s funding programs as Secretary of Energy, even if President-elect Trump pressures him to give preference to one of Trump’s favored businesses. She also pressed Mr. Wright about whether he would allow exports of natural gas, even at the expense of rising utility bills for Americans. 

“If you are confirmed, your obligation will be to the American people, not to the shareholders or board members for an oil or gas company,”  said Senator Hirono. 

The full transcript of Senator Hirono’s exchange with Mr. Wright is available below. Video of Senator Hirono’s question line can be found  here  . 

Sen. Hirono:  Before I get to my questions I just want to note that we did not receive information relating to this nominee until really late yesterday and it would have been good if we could have followed the process that would have given us more time, which meant that this hearing would not be happening today. 

So, for the nominee, as part of my responsibilities as a member of this as well as all my other committees, I ask the following two initial questions to ascertain the fitness of the nominee for the job. So I ask you, since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? 

Mr. Wright:  I have not. 

Sen. Hirono:  Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct? 

Mr. Wright:  I have not. 

Sen. Hirono:  It is shocking to see the devastation that is caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles, and of course we are seeing that it’s shocking. In 2023, a wildfire killed 102 people and destroyed the town of Lahaina on Maui and Hawaiian Electric, which is our major utility company, received a $95 million award from the DOE to help in rebuilding Maui’s electric grid and reduce the risk of future wildfires. 

The state of Hawaii has also received other support and funding from the DOE to proceed with this kind of modernization. Do you acknowledge the need for improvements to our electric grids that will reduce the risk of wildfires and ensure reliable access to power? 

Mr. Wright:  Senator, thank you for your question and boy, I remember watching with horror the fires in Lahaina and the fires today in L.A., it is absolute human tragedy. It is devastating. But to answer your question, absolutely, yes we need to improve our electric grid both for increased supply, for increased resilience to natural disasters and events. 

Sen. Hirono:  So as we see these kinds of natural disasters, I think states and municipalities will need help from the DOE, so will you continue allocating funding for grid improvements as authorized by Congress? Yes or no? 

Mr. Wright:  Well, I am not quite sure it is as simple as that. But I think that my short answer would be yes, of course I want to work with you and other states to increase grid resilience. 

Sen. Hirono:  I appreciate that. 

The DOE is required to ensure that all construction and repair projects funded by the DOE under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act pay prevailing wages. Will you pay prevailing wages as required under the infrastructure law that I just mentioned? 

Mr. Wright:  Senator, if I have the privilege to be confirmed I will follow the laws and statutes of the United States. 

Sen. Hirono:  And that would mean paying prevailing wages on these kinds of projects. 

The Washington Post reported that in April 2024, Donald Trump told a group of about 24 oil executives at Mar-a-Lago that they should raise $1 billion for his campaign, which would be a ‘deal,’ given his commitment to reversing environmental regulations, expanding oil and gas leasing on federal land, and approval of natural gas exports. Did you attend that meeting at Mar-a-Lago? 

Mr. Wright:  I was at a dinner with President Trump in Mar-a-Lago in April—quite a bit different than what you just described, but yes I was at a dinner. 

Sen. Hirono:  Well, it was reported he talked about a $1 billion—do you think that it was appropriate for the President to even put forth the possibility of such a deal? 

Mr. Wright:  I was at the dinner and the President put forward no such deal. 

Sen. Hirono:  That is not what was reported. 

As Secretary of Energy you will have oversight over a lot of contracts, grants, and loan guarantees. Are you prepared to engage in vigorous oversight of DOE funding, even if President Trump pressures you to approve ‘sweetheart deals’ to one of his favorite businesses? Will you be objective, should you be confirmed? 

Mr. Wright:  I have followed rigorous and ethical business practices my whole life, senator, and will continue to do exactly that at the Department of Energy if I have the privilege of being confirmed. 

Sen. Hirono:  I only have a little bit of time, but I do want to get to this—if you are confirmed, your obligation will be to the American people, not to the shareholders or board members for an oil or gas company. Would you allow all exports of natural gas to China and anywhere else around the world, regardless of whether the exports would increase heating and power bills for the American people? 

Mr. Wright:  Senator, I would love to have more time to talk about natural gas exports. The brief history of them is as we have grown our natural gas exports, our price of natural gas has gone down because the industry—the natural gas production industry—has benefited from scale. 

Sen. Hirono:  So you’re telling me that you would? I’m asking whether you would take into consideration what the impact for the cost of energy in America would be if you allow export of these oil and gas. So you would keep that uppermost in mind right? What the impact of these kinds of exports would be to the cost of energy to our American people? 

Mr. Wright:  Absolutely, senator, I share your concern there.

WASHINGTON, DC  – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced five amendments to S.5, the  Laken Riley Act  .  As it is currently written, the bill would change immigration and Constitutional law by empowering states to challenge immigration decisions made by the federal government and requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain any undocumented individual who is charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admits to theft or related crimes. It would also require ICE to ask local law enforcement to detain undocumented individuals currently within their custody who have committed such crimes. 

Senator Hirono’s amendments aim to mitigate the harm caused by this legislation by prohibiting minors from being detained; stopping the separation of families with children under the age of 16; and preventing states from suing the federal government for immigration decisions. 

“Our country desperately needs comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform,”  said Senator Hirono.  “Unfortunately, this bill would not improve our immigration system, and would have all sorts of unintended consequences for immigrants, our immigration system, and our communities. My amendments would mitigate some of the most troubling impacts of this bill, but there is no amendment that would adequately fix this poorly thought out piece of legislation.” 

Specifically, Senator Hirono’s five amendments would: 

  1. Exempt anyone who received a grant of deferred action through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or who came to the United States before the age of 16 from the mandatory detention section of the bill (Section 2), and prevents states from challenging the federal government’s decisions on the apprehension and detention of anyone who received a grant of deferred action through DACA or who came to the United States before the age of 16; 
  2. Clarify that the mandatory detention section of the bill (Section 2) does not apply to any criminal charges, arrests, convictions, or acts admitted to have committed when the undocumented individual was under 18; 
  3. Clarify that the mandatory detention section of the bill (Section 2) does not apply when the detention would result in the separation of anyone under 16 from their parents; 
  4. Eliminate the section of the bill that allows states to challenge various federal immigration decisions (Section 3); and 
  5. Require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue annual public reports on the cost of implementing the mandatory detention section of the bill (Section 2), including the cost of contracts with private prisons, and the best estimates of the profit private companies make as a result of the section.

WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned Pam Bondi, President-elect Trump’s nominee to be Attorney General of the United States, at Bondi’s confirmation hearing. During her line of inquiry, Senator Hirono pressed Ms. Bondi on her fitness to serve as Attorney General, including her willingness to put loyalty to the Constitution over loyalty to the President. 

“Ms. Bondi, your experience as a prosecutor is the kind of thing we would expect to see in a nominee for Attorney General,”  said Senator Hirono.  “But I do have questions and concerns about potential conflicts of interest, about whether you will keep DOJ’s law enforcement responsibilities independent of the President's political whims, and about whether you will let facts and evidence guide your decisions.” 

Senator Hirono began with two questions related to sexual misconduct, which she has  asked every nominee since 2018  . She then asked Ms. Bondi about who she believed won the 2020 presidential election.  Ms. Bondi repeatedly refused to state that Joseph Biden won the election. 

“I can say that Donald Trump won the 2024 election,”  continued Senator Hirono.  “I may not like it, but I can say it. You cannot say who won the 2020 presidential election. It is disturbing that you can’t give voice to that fact.” 

Senator Hirono also raised her concerns about the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) independence from politics in the upcoming Trump administration. After reciting several outrageous quotes from President-elect Trump regarding undocumented immigrants and the felons who broke into the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Senator Hirono pressed Ms. Bondi on whether she agreed with those statements.  Ms. Bondi refused to agree  with or condemn these statements made by President-elect Trump. 

“You have an incoming President who said, ‘I have the absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department,’ and, in fact, President-elect Trump considers the DOJ to be his law firm,”  said Senator Hirono during the exchange.  “I think it is really important to us that the Attorney General be independent of the White House.” 

Senator Hirono then asked Ms. Bondi whether she would comply if President-elect Trump asks, suggests, or hints that she—as Attorney General—should investigate his perceived political enemies. When Senator Hirono pressed Ms. Bondi on whether she would prosecute or investigate Jack Smith, Liz Cheney, or Merrick Garland after becoming Attorney General,  Ms. Bondi refused to explicitly deny or confirm whether she would comply with President-elect Trump’s request to investigate or prosecute any of the individuals listed. 

The full transcript of Senator Hirono’s exchange with Ms. Bondi is available below. Video of Senator Hirono’s question line can be found  here  . 

Sen. Hirono:  As part of my responsibility to ensure the fitness of all nominees I ask the following two initial questions—first, since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? 

Ms. Bondi:  No, senator. 

Sen. Hirono:  Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct? 

Ms. Bondi:  No, senator. 

Sen. Hirono:  Ms. Bondi, I am focused on two things in my evaluation of President-elect Trump’s nominees. The first is whether the nominee is qualified and experienced enough to do the job. The second is fitness to serve, which includes putting loyalty to the Constitution over loyalty to the President. Unfortunately in my view, many of President-elect Trump’s nominees are lacking in at least one of these two requirements. 

Ms. Bondi, your experience as a prosecutor is the kind of thing we would expect to see in a nominee for Attorney General, but I do have questions and concerns about potential conflicts of interest, about whether you will keep DOJ’s law enforcement responsibilities independent of the President's political whims, and about whether you will let facts and evidence guide your decisions. So, let’s start with the importance of facts, which you say is important. 

Ms. Bondi, we want an attorney general who bases decisions on facts. So, I want to ask you a factual question. Who won the 2020 presidential election? 

Ms. Bondi:  Joe Biden is the President of the United States. 

Sen. Hirono:  Ms. Bondi, you know there is a difference between acknowledging it and you know, I can say that Donald Trump won the 2024 election. I may not like it, but I can say it. You cannot say who won the 2020 presidential election. It is disturbing that you can’t give voice to that fact. 

Moving on to DOJ’s independence from politics, Ms. Bondi if you are confirmed as Attorney General, you will take an oath to the Constitution and not to any individual, including the President. To start, I would like to know whether you agree with some of the statements President-elect Trump made during the election, during the campaign. First, are the felons convicted of breaking into the Capitol on January 6 “hostages” or “patriots,” quoting Trump—as President-elect Trump has said repeatedly? Do you agree with his characterization of the felons that I refer to? 

Ms. Bondi:  I am not familiar with that statement, senator. 

Sen. Hirono:  I just familiarized you with that statement, do you agree with that statement? 

Ms. Bondi:  I’m not familiar with it, senator. 

Sen. Hirono:  No answer. He has also said, “Illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation.” He said that in December 2023. Do you agree with that statement? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator, I'm not familiar with that statement. But what I can tell you is, I went to the border a few months ago. I went to Yuma, Arizona, and what I saw at that border was horrific, senator. It was horrific. I went to a rape crisis center— 

Sen. Hirono:  Ms. Bondi that is not my question. 

Ms. Bondi:  If I could finish, I went to a rape crisis center. Well, I am not familiar with the statement, but I went to a rape crisis center. I met with border patrol agents. I'm sure you have been to the border as well. So you can answer that. 

Sen. Hirono:  I want to get to my next question. So, I believe that you responded to a question from Senator Whitehouse and let me get your response again. You said that the White House, if I'm putting words in your mouth correct me, you said the White House will play no role in investigative or charging decisions in the DOJ. Is that correct? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator, what I said is, that it is the Department of Justice's decision to determine what cases will be prosecuted. 

Sen. Hirono:  What role will the White House have in investigative or prosecutorial decisions of the DOJ? 

Ms. Bondi:  It is the Department of Justice's decision, senator. 

Sen. Hirono:  That sounds to me like you are saying that the White House will not have any kind of role. Meanwhile, though, you have an incoming President who said, “I have the absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.” And, in fact, President-elect Trump considers the DOJ to be his law firm. I ask you this—if President-elect Trump asks, suggests, or hints that you as Attorney General should investigate one of his perceived political enemies, would you do so? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator Hirono, I wish you had met with me. Had you met with me, we could have discussed many things and you could have gotten to know me. 

Sen. Hirono:  I am listening to you now, could you respond to the question? 

Ms. Bondi:  Yeah, you were the only one who refused to meet with me, senator, but what we would have discussed is that it is the job of the Attorney General to follow the law. 

Sen. Hirono:  I am very happy to listen to your responses under oath, Ms. Bondi. So, I think it is really important to us that the Attorney General be independent of the White House and you have a President-elect who considers the AG’s office his law firm. I would like to know whether if the President suggests, hints, asks that you as Attorney General should investigate one of his perceived enemies, what would you do? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator, I certainly have not heard the President say that, but what I will tell you is that two thirds of Americans have lost faith in the Department of Justice. And it is statements like that, I believe, that make people continue to lose faith. If I am confirmed as Attorney General, it will be my job to not only keep America safe— 

Sen. Hirono:  Getting to my next question, you are not responding. 

Ms. Bondi:  —but restore integrity to that department. And that is what I plan on doing every single day. 

Sen. Hirono:  Why don’t we move on to something you said? On August 25, [2023] on Fox News you said, “When Republicans take back the White House, the Department of Justice, the prosecutors who will be prosecuted, the bad ones, the investigators will be investigated.” 

Ms. Bondi, is Jack Smith one of those “bad prosecutors” that you will prosecute as AG? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator, you hesitated a bit when I said “the bad ones.” Every decision will be made— 

Sen. Hirono:  Sometimes badness is in the eyes of the beholder. I am just asking whether you would consider Jack Smith to be one of the people? How about Liz Cheney? How about Merrick Garland? 

Ms. Bondi:  Senator, I am not going to answer hypotheticals. No one has been pre-judged, nor will anyone be pre-judged if I am confirmed. 

Sen. Hirono:  I am asking if these are in fact the people you would prosecute.

WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, pressed Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, on his fitness to serve, character, and qualifications to lead the Department of Defense (DOD). During her line of inquiry, Senator Hirono questioned Mr. Hegseth on numerous reports of personal misconduct, sexual assault, and whether, if confirmed he will be loyal to the Constitution or Donald Trump. 

Senator Hirono began with two questions related to sexual misconduct, which she has  asked every nominee since 2018  . She also raised her concerns about reports of Mr. Hegseth’s personal misconduct, including regularly being drunk at work. Senator Hirono then asked Mr. Hegseth to commit, under oath, that he will resign if he drinks alcohol while serving as Secretary of Defense.  Notably, Mr. Hegseth refused to make such a commitment, despite  repeatedly claiming  he will not drink if confirmed. 

“  I'm not hearing an answer to my question so I'm going to move on,”  said Senator Hirono during the exchange.  “While you have made a commitment, you will not commit to resigning if you drink on the job.” 

Senator Hirono then asked Mr. Hegseth whether his allegiance to President-elect Trump would take precedent over the oath he will make to support and defend our Constitution, if he is sworn in as Secretary of Defense. Senator Hirono cited an example from 2020 when then-President Trump directed former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to shoot protesters in the legs in Downtown D.C., an order Secretary Esper refused.  When pressed by Senator Hirono, Mr. Hegseth refused to explicitly deny whether he would comply if Trump gave him a similar order. 

“That sounds to me that you would comply with such an order,”  said Senator Hirono.  “You would shoot protesters in the leg. Moving on.” 

Senator Hirono then cited several of President-elect Trump’s comments, including his refusal to rule out using military force to seize Greenland and the Panama Canal, his threats to invade Canada, as well as his intention to revoke the DOD’s current policy to allow servicemembers to be reimbursed for travel associated with reproductive health care, including abortions. Senator Hirono also expressed her concern over President-elect Trump’s comments to use the military to enable the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants—a decision that would significantly threaten our military readiness and cost billions of dollars. 

“Mr. Hegseth, I have noticed a disturbing pattern—you previously have made a series of inflammatory statements about women in combat, LGBTQ servicemembers, Muslim Americans and Democrats. Since your nomination, however, you have walked those back on TV and interviews, and most recently in your opening statements,”  said Senator Hirono.  “You are no longer on ‘Fox and Friends,’ Mr. Hegseth. If confirmed, your words, actions, and decisions would have real impacts on national security and our servicemembers’ lives. There are close to 3 million personnel in the Department of Defense—$900 billion budget. I hardly think you are prepared to do the job.” 

The full transcript of Senator Hirono’s exchange with Mr. Hegseth is available below. Video of Senator Hirono’s question line can be found  here  . 

Senator Hirono:  Mr. Hegseth, welcome. I am focused on your fitness to serve including your character and temperament and your overall qualifications to do the job and I do appreciate the comments of Ranking Member Reed with his concerns regarding your nomination because I share those concerns. 

As part of my responsibility as a member of this committee, to ensure the fitness of all nominees who come before any of the committees on which I sit, I ask the following two initial questions: first, since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? 

Mr. Hegseth:  No, senator. 

Senator Hirono:  Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, I was falsely accused in October of 2017. It was fully investigated and I was completely cleared. 

Senator Hirono:  I don't think completely cleared is accurate, but the fact is that your own lawyer said that you entered into an NDA, and paid a person who accused you of raping her a sum of money to make sure that she did not file a complaint. Moving on. 

As secretary you will be in charge of maintaining good order and discipline by enforcing the uniform code of military justice, UCMJ. In addition to the sexual assault allegations—and by the way, the answer to my second question should have been yes—I have read multiple reports of you regularly being drunk at work, including by people who worked with you at Fox News. Do you know that being drunk at work is prohibited for servicemembers under the UCMJ? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, those are— 

Senator Hirono:  Yes or no? 

Mr. Hegseth:  —multiple false anonymous reports peddled by NBC News that run directly contradictory to the dozens of men and women who I work with – 

Senator Hirono:  I'm not hearing the answer to my question. In your opening statement, Mr. Hegseth, you commit to holding leaders accountable at all levels—that includes you, of course. And frankly, as Secretary you will be on the job 24/7. You recently promised some of my Republican colleagues that you stopped drinking and won’t drink if confirmed—correct? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Absolutely. 

Senator Hirono:  Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job, which is a ‘24/7’ position? 

Mr. Hegseth:  I've made this commitment on behalf— 

Senator Hirono:  Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job? 

Mr. Hegseth:  I've made these commitment on behalf of the men and women I'm serving because it’s the most important deployment of my life. 

Senator Hirono:  I'm not hearing an answer to my question so I'm going to move on. While you have made a commitment, you will not commit to resigning if you drink on the job. 

As Secretary of Defense, you will swear an oath to the constitution and not an oath to any man, woman or President—correct? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, on multiple occasions including as a young second lieutenant, I have sworn an oath to the constitution and am proud to do so— 

Senator Hirono:  The answer is yes. 

Mr. Hegseth:  Yes ma'am. 

Senator Hirono:  In June of 2020 then-President Trump directed former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to shoot protesters in the legs in Downtown D.C., an order Secretary Esper refused to comply with. Would you carry out such an order from President Trump? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, I was in the Washington, D.C. National Guard unit that was in Lafayette Square during those events, holding a riot shield on behalf of my country— 

Senator Hirono:  Would you carry out an order to shoot protesters in the legs? 

Mr. Hegseth:  I saw 50 Secret Service agents get injured by rioters trying to jump over the fence, set the church on fire, and destroy a statue. Chaos— 

Senator Hirono:  That sounds to me that you would comply with such an order. You would shoot protesters in the leg. Moving on. 

The President-elect has attacked our allies in recent weeks, refusing to rule out using military force to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal, and threatening to make Canada the 51st state. Would you carry out an order from President Trump to seize Greenland—a territory of our NATO ally Denmark—by force, or would you comply with an order to take over the Panama Canal? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, I will emphasize that President Trump received 77 million votes to be the lawful commander-in-chief of this country— 

Senator Hirono:  We are not talking about the election. My question is would you use our military to take over Greenland, or an ally of Denmark? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, one of the things that President Trump is so good at is never strategically tipping his hand. And so I would never, in this public forum, give one way or another direct what orders the President would give me in any context. 

Senator Hirono:  That sounds to me that you would contemplate carrying out such an order to basically invade Greenland and take over the Panama Canal. 

Current DOD policy allows servicemembers and eligible dependents to be reimbursed for travel associated with non-covert reproductive health care, including abortions. Will you maintain this commonsense policy? 

Mr. Hegseth:  Senator, I've always been personally pro-life, I know President Trump has as well, and we will review all policies, but our standard is whatever the President wants on this particular issue, with my advice I will take a look at, but— 

Senator Hirono:  So if the President tells you that this policy will not be maintained, you will not enable our servicemembers to seek reproductive care. That is what it sounds like to me. 

Mr. Hegseth:  I don't believe the federal government should be funding travel for abortion— 

Senator Hirono:  I'm not hearing answers to my questions, Mr. Chairman. 

I just want to note that the other area of serious concern to me is President Trump saying that he wants to use the military to help with mass deportations, which would cost billions of dollars and what that would do to readiness is very, very concerning. 

Mr. Hegseth, I have noticed a disturbing pattern. You previously have made a series of inflammatory statements about women in combat, LGBTQ servicemembers, Muslim Americans, and Democrats. Since your nominations, however, you have walked those back on TV and interviews and most recently in your opening statements. You are no longer on ‘Fox and Friends,’ Mr. Hegseth. If confirmed, your words, actions, and decisions would have real impacts on national security and our servicemembers’ lives. There are close to 3 million personnel in the Department of Defense—$900 billion budget. I hardly think you are prepared to do the job. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:34:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Representative Jill Tokuda (D-HI) introduced legislation to fight the spread of Rapid Ohia Death (ROD) and help restore native forests in Hawaii. 

The  Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2025  enables federal agencies – including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) – to more closely coordinate with the State of Hawaii to prevent the spread of ROD.? 

“Over the past decade, Rapid Ohia Death has decimated Hawaii’s Ohia population, posing a serious threat to not just the species’ survival, but to our local ecosystems as well,”  said Senator Hirono.  “Ohia Lehua are crucial to Native Hawaiian culture, as well as the environment, playing a key role in protecting watersheds and conserving water. This legislation will require continued federal support to prevent the spread of this disease, identify Ohia trees that are resistant to ROD, and propagate trees that are resistant to ROD to restore and preserve our native forests. I will keep working to ensure that Hawaii has the resources needed to prevent further Ohia death and protect our state’s unique biodiversity and culture for generations to come.” 

ROD is a fungus,?  Ceratocystis  , that was discovered in Hawaii in 2014. It has killed over a million native Ohia trees and has been detected on Hawaii Island, Kauai, Maui, and Oahu. In that time, the USFS has partnered with the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of the Interior in efforts to detect and respond to the spread of ROD. The  Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of  ?  2025  ?would support these ongoing efforts by: 

  * Directing the U.S. Geological Survey to continue supporting research on ROD vectors and transmission; 


  * Requiring the U.S. Forest Service, to continue providing resources to prevent the spread of ROD and restore the native forests in Hawaii, and to also continue to provide financial and staff resources to the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry (IPIF), located in Hilo, to continue research on ROD; and 


  * Directing the Department of the Interior to collaborate with the Department of Agriculture and the State of Hawai‘i to continue and expand detection, prevention, and restoration efforts to Rapid Ohia Death, including funding and staff for necessary research.?

“I am deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the TikTok ban. With 170 million users and seven million businesses relying on TikTok, a TikTok ban taking effect on Sunday would be profoundly harmful - from creators losing their livelihoods, to communities losing an essential communication tool during emergencies such as the Los Angeles wildfires. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans blocked my legislation this week to extend the TikTok deadline. I have been urging, and will continue to urge, the Biden administration to use its authority in the law to extend the TikTok deadline and ensure that this critical communication platform does not go dark on Sunday, causing serious harm to millions of creators.” 

On January 16, 2025, Senator Markey, along with Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), sent a  letter  to President Joe Biden urging him to trigger the 90-day extension in the  Protection Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act  to allow ByteDance additional time to divest from TikTok. On January 15, 2025, Senators Markey, Booker, and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Congressman Khanna (CA-17) introduced the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  , legislation that would delay the January 19 deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban, by an additional 270 days. 

Senators Markey and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Congressman Khanna, recently submitted a  bipartisan, bicameral amicus brief  urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit Court's decision in  TikTok Inc. v. Garland  , which upheld the TikTok ban established under the  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.  On December 19, Senators Markey and Paul sent a  letter  to President Joe Biden urging him to provide TikTok owner ByteDance with a 90-day extension to either sell TikTok or face the ban.

Washington (January 17, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez (NY-07), today announced the reintroduction of the  Fueling Alternative Transportation with a Carbon Aviation Tax (FATCAT) Act  , legislation that would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from 22 cents to $2 per gallon— the equivalent of an estimated $200 per metric ton of a private jet’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions — and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for logging and oil or gas exploration. 

The incoming Trump administration is on track to be the wealthiest in American history, with at least 13 billionaires tapped for roles. Many billionaire donors and friends are expected to sit on the dais on Inauguration day, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Brian Armstrong, and Sam Altman. Many of these billionaires are consistent users of private jets, the most energy-intense form of travel. 

Tax revenue generated by the  FATCAT Act  would be transferred to the Airport & Airway Trust Fund and a newly created federal Clean Communities Trust Fund to support air monitoring for disadvantaged communities and long-term investments in clean, affordable public transportation across the country, including passenger rail and bus routes near commercial airports. 

“If you look in the sky over Washington D.C. this inauguration weekend, you might see one of the many billionaires flying in their private jets to celebrate a Trump administration that is of the rich and for the rich,”  said Senator Markey  . “As the world burns, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are working hard to prepare new tax cuts to benefit the super-wealthy at the expense of working Americans. It is time to make billionaire fat cats pay the absolute bare minimum to fly private jets and prioritize clean public transportation.” 

“Billionaires shouldn’t get a free pass to fly private and pollute while working families subsidize the bill,”  said Congresswoman Velázquez  . “If billionaires want to travel on private jets, they should pay similar taxes to those flying commercial. The  FATCAT Act  makes the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share so that we can fund environmental justice and affordable public transit for all.” 

In only one year, private jet emissions from just four incoming Trump officials pumped out the equivalent of 560 years’ worth of carbon emitted by the average American. Oxfam International found that 14 American billionaires, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, have combined annual emissions just from flying in private jets equivalent to about 2,000 years’ worth of emissions by the average American and nearly 5000 years for an average person globally. The private jets owned by these 14 billionaires were in the air long enough to circumnavigate the world over 157 times. 

Per passenger, private jets pollute up to 14 times more than commercial flights and 50 times more than trains, producing as much emissions as millions of cars every year in the United States. 

This pollution comes at the expense of the American people. Despite their sky-high emissions, private air travel is taxed considerably less than commercial air travel. Private jets account for seven percent of all flights handled by the FAA but provide less than one percent of taxes that fund the federal trust fund for aviation and airports. 

Under the  FATCAT Act  , these four Trump administration officials and associates would pay millions more in taxes to support air quality monitoring and alternative transportation. Overall, private jet users, the  FATCAT Act  would collect billions of dollars in revenue. 

Trump Associates’  Private Jet Emissions (metric tons of Co2) 

Jared Isaacman, NASA Administrator – 3,862.67 

Steve Witkoff, Middle East Envoy – 2,284.89 

Elon Musk, D.O.G.E – 1,699.69 

David Sacks, AI and crypto czar – 866.2 

Cosponsors of the  FATCAT Act  include Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 

The legislation is endorsed by Transportation for America, Americans for Tax Fairness, Patriotic Millionaires, Oxfam America, Public Citizen, and the Sunrise Movement. 

“The current tax system favors the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of average Americans. By ensuring the wealthy contribute their fair share in federal taxes, we could better fund essential public services like environmental protection and clean water infrastructure,”  said David Kass, Executive Director of Americans for Tax Fairness  . “It’s time that these wealthy individuals with their reckless constant use of private jets pay for their luxury travel which pollutes all of our communities. The proposed Private Jet Fuel Excise Tax, which targets luxury consumption, is a strong step toward balancing the system.” 

“Private jets are the ultimate status symbol of inequality, yet their owners pay significantly less in taxes on flights than regular people flying economy class. By passing the  Fueling Alternative Transportation with a Carbon Aviation Tax (FATCAT) Act  of 2025, lawmakers would show that Congress stands with everyday Americans rather than with rich polluting billionaires,”  said Ashfaq Khalfan, Climate Justice Director at Oxfam America  . “To put this outrageous disparity into perspective: Elon Musk’s two private jets produce each year the same emissions as 834 years’ worth of emissions for the average person in the world. The two private jets owned by Jeff Bezos emit 2,908 tonnes of CO2. It would take the average US Amazon employee almost 207 years to emit that much. Congress must address economic and climate justice as it considers tax legislation, and this law is an important litmus test for that commitment.” 

“The jetsetting of a handful of rich people is fueling the fires scorching lives and livelihoods in Los Angeles. By joining together across the country, we can make them pay us what they owe and fund the repair we deserve. Anybody taking a private jet likely has at least $100 million in the bank and can afford to pay a little more so the rest of us can survive,”  said Aru Shiney-Ajay, Executive Director of the Sunrise Movement  . 

“The private jet class may be under the delusion that they can fly away from their responsibility for worsening the climate crisis, but Senator Edward Markey’s FATCAT bill lands just in time to correct that misimpression,”  said Robert Weissman, President of Public Citizen  . “This bill taxes some of the most climate destructive activity of the super-rich and invests the revenues to promote public transportation and environmental justice, a double win for climate justice.” 

“I love using private air travel - it is one of the coolest aspects of wealth that I have ever experienced. It’s like drinking coffee - once you start, you can’t quit! But when I learned about the outsized damage that private air travel has done to our environment, coupled with the outrageous tax breaks that Uncle Sam gives those of us who fly in our own planes, I made the decision to sell my private jet last year. 

“It became clear that I could no longer prioritize my own comfort over the health of our planet and our nation. It disappoints me that most of my wealthy peers who can afford to fly privately at their convenience, but do not see fit to contribute to our country’s infrastructure by simply paying their share of taxes for the financial burden that our lavish lifestyles create. 

“Senator Markey’s new bill, which would increase excise taxes on fuel used by private jets, will go a long way toward correcting this abuse of our planet’s resources. I doubt that many of my peers will stop flying private or follow my example, but if wealthy jet owners want to continue destroying our environment, the least they can do is help pay some of the costs for their egregious, self-serving habit,”  said Stephen Prince, Founder of Card Marketing Services and Vice-Chair of the Patriotic Millionaires  . 

Senator Markey has long pushed for reducing emissions from the transportation sector. He has championed vehicle emission and fuel economy standards, such as the  Energy Independence and Security Act  of 2007. That law included then-Congressman Markey’s language that set the standard to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020 and required the “maximum feasible standard” to be set every year. In April 2023, Senators Markey and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.)  celebrated  the Environmental Protection Agency for heeding their calls to swiftly issue regulations to curb greenhouse gases among other pollutants for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles for Model Year 2027 and beyond. Senator Markey also supported emission reductions from ports and vessels through the  Expanding Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program (META) Act  .

10:34:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: 21 Senators and 8 Representatives Call on Supreme Court to Uphold the Universal Service Fund, Ensure Rural and Underserved Areas Have Access to Broadband 

Washington (January 16, 2025) - Senator Markey joined Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of upholding the Universal Service Fund (USF), a critical federal program that has reliably supported broadband access in the most rural and underserved areas of the country for nearly 30 years. The Supreme Court’s case,  Consumers’ Research v. FCC,  concerns claims of unconstitutionality in the current funding mechanism for USF and the court’s ruling can potentially cut off broadband service to some of our country’s most underserved areas. 

In the amicus brief, Senators Markey, Luján, Fischer, and a group of 26 bipartisan Senators and Representatives argue that  Congress has established sufficient universal service policy and principles to direct the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) implementation of the Universal Service programs & contribution mechanism. The Senators also argue that  Congress exercises significant oversight of the FCC’s implementation of USF, and the work performed by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) does not undermine political accountability. The Senators state that  the dismantling USF would have dire consequences for millions of Americans, impeding efforts to close the digital divide. 

“From New Mexico’s rural schools and hospitals to working families in underserved and rural communities, the Universal Service Fund has been instrumental in expanding broadband access across the country,”  said Senator Luján  . “As I argue in my amicus, Congress has already established sufficient policies and guardrails to ensure the FCC stays within its mandate in its implementation of the program. Dismantling USF would be devasting for Americans who have relied on this critical program for decades and would leave millions on the wrong side of the digital divide.” 

“Congress set clear goals for the mission of universal service, and the Universal Service Fund has been fulfilling those goals for nearly 30 years. The fund has extended broadband and communications access to the most unserved parts of our country. I am proud so many of my colleagues in the Senate and House joined this brief highlighting USF’s role in rural America to inform the Court’s decision,”  said Senator Fischer  . 

Joining Senators Markey, Luján and Fischer in submitting the amicus brief are Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Angus King (I-Maine), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Representatives James Clyburn (D-S.C.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), Nick Begich (R-Ala.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), and Brad Finstad (R-Minn.).

Washington (January 16, 2025) - Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) held a press conference today announcing their letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to trigger the 90-day extension in the  Protection Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act  to allow ByteDance additional time to divest from TikTok before facing a ban in the United States. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) also signed the letter. 

In the letter the Senators write  , “Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok. A shutdown would be especially painful for creators in California who have been using the platform to share their stories and find resources during the tragic wildfires around Los Angeles. With Senate Republicans blocking legislation introduced this week to extend the TikTok divest-or-ban deadline and the Supreme Court, by all accounts, appearing unlikely to come to TikTok’s aid, your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday.” 

On January 15, 2025, Senators Markey, Booker, and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Congressman Khanna (CA-17) introduced the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  , legislation that would delay the January 19 deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban, by an additional 270 days. Senators Markey and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Congressman Khanna, recently submitted a  bipartisan, bicameral amicus brief  urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit Court's decision in  TikTok Inc. v. Garland  , which upheld the TikTok ban established under the  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.  On December 19, Senators Markey and Paul sent a  letter  to President Joe Biden urging him to provide TikTok owner ByteDance with a 90-day extension to either sell TikTok or face the ban.

10:34:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington (January 16, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today released the following statement celebrating the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) final rule updating its Children’s Online Privacy Protect Act (COPPA) rule. Senators Markey and Bill Cassidy (D-La.) are the Senate authors of the  Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act  (COPPA 2.0). 

“I applaud the Federal Trade Commission for its bipartisan action to update the COPPA Rule, helping it keep pace with the ever-evolving digital landscape,”  said Senator Markey  . “This updated rule strengthens critical protections for children’s personal information and reaffirms our shared commitment to safeguarding young users in the online world. By modernizing these standards, the FTC is helping to address a youth mental health crisis, driven in part by Big Tech, and create a safer digital environment that prioritizes privacy for kids and families. I thank the Commission for its leadership and dedication to protecting the most vulnerable among us through this important bipartisan effort. 

“While today's action is an important step forward, Congress must still pass my  Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act  to extend these protections to teenagers, block targeted advertising to kids and teens, and give young people an eraser button to delete their personal information. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation into law.” 

The FTC issues the COPPA rule under its authority under the  Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  , which Senator Markey authored in 1998. The Commission last updated its COPPA rule in 2013. In September 2024, the House Energy and Commerce Committee  passed  COPPA 2.0  by a voice vote. In July, the U.S. Senate  passed  the  Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act  , which included  COPPA 2.0  , by a 91-3 vote. In July 2023, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee unanimously  passed  COPPA 2.0.

Bill Text (PDF) 

Washington (January 16, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) today reintroduced the  Banning In Government Oil Industry Lobbyists (BIG OIL) from the Cabinet Act,  which would prohibit the appointment of executive officers and lobbyists of fossil fuel entities or trade associations as the heads or political appointees of certain government departments that work on issues related to American energy policy for a 10-year period. This includes Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, whose Wednesday hearing reinforced his many conflicts of interest from leading multiple oil and gas companies focused on fracking—most recently, as CEO of Liberty Energy. 

“Donald Trump isn’t building a cabinet, he’s installing a cartel,”  said Senator Markey  . “Big Oil executives and fossil fuel lobbyists shouldn’t be able to turn public agencies into private profit machines for fossil fuel shareholders. This is a clear ethical line—their work polluting our environment, destroying our climate, and prioritizing corporate profits over democracy must not be rewarded with even more power over the very safeguards set to protect American households from their influence. Especially in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires and more frequent and dangerous disasters fueled by climate change, we can't afford to have a fossil fuel CEO like Chris Wright help the industry capture our federal agencies further for oil profits. We must have government agencies helmed by responsible, qualified executives without blatant conflicts of interest.” 

“Climate chaos fueled by dirty energy is humanity's greatest challenge, and Trump wants to make sure we fail that challenge by handing our government over to Big Oil. Let’s pass this bill and get fossil fuel executives and their ill-gotten bucks out of our government,”  said Senator Merkley  . 

“The fossil fuel revolving door has dominated American energy policy for decades and could poison our environment for centuries to come. Oil and gas companies cannot be allowed to regulate themselves and use the government to guarantee their profits. The  BIG OIL from the Cabinet Act  is a crucial step in returning control of our climate to the American people,”  said Drew Guillory, Policy Advisor for Food and Water Watch  . 

“Los Angeles is on fire. Asheville is just starting to rebuild. The climate crisis is here and it's happening because oil and gas CEOs disregarded science and chose to keep burning fossil fuels. They chose to sacrifice millions of homes and lives so they could keep profiting. Those same people should not be in charge of creating energy policy,”  said Aru Shiney-Ajay, Executive Director of Sunrise Movement  . 

“The fossil fuel industry is notorious for spending millions of dollars to delay climate action and undermine progress on environmental justice. This bill ensures big polluters are not granted positions of power where it is guaranteed they would degrade environmental protections and block investments in a clean energy future,”  said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks  .

Thank you, President Biden, for your efforts and those of your diplomatic team and negotiators from Qatar and Egypt, to make this agreement possible.”

Bill Text (PDF) 

Washington (January 14, 2025) - Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Representative Ro Khanna (CA-17) today announced the introduction of the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  , legislation that would delay the January 19 deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban, by an additional 270 days. On January 13, Senator Markey delivered  remarks  on the U.S. Senate floor and live on TikTok regarding the consequences if TikTok is banned in the United States. 

“The TikTok ban was rushed through without sufficient consideration of the profound consequences it would have on the 170 million Americans who use the platform,”  said Senator Markey  . “Today, TikTok is a space where users share critical resources during emergencies such as the Los Angeles wildfires, earn money to cover groceries and medical care, and build community in challenging times. The  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  is a straightforward, one-sentence bill designed to give Congress the time needed to fully assess the implications of this ban. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly on this legislation.” 

“The rushed divestment of Tiktok is a huge giveaway to Donald Trump and his cronies, who are poised to scoop up a massive social media company and turn it into another partisan mouthpiece. I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to protecting American's personal data from China -- I've written three of the strongest bills on offer to protect sensitive U.S. data. Extending the deadline to sell TikTok will allow Congress to consider better ways to mitigate threats from China, courts to review the law, and additional bidders to make proposals to acquire TikTok with more time for public scrutiny,”  said Senator Wyden  . 

“Tens of millions of Americans use TikTok for entertainment, business, and social networking, including myself,”  said Senator Booker  . “Americans should not be shut off from freely expressing themselves on the platforms they choose. I do believe that ByteDance should divest from TikTok, but it should be given sufficient time to carry out a sale. That’s why I’m partnering with Senators Markey and Wyden on this legislation that would extend the deadline.” 

  
“A ban on TikTok violates the free speech of 170 million Americans and hurts the livelihoods of creators and small business owners who use the app,”  said Representative Khanna  . “We need laws to protect Americans’ data, but banning TikTok is not the answer. I’m proud to join Senator Markey in introducing this legislation to pause the TikTok ban for 270 days.” 

Senators Markey and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Congressman Ro Khanna (CA-17), recently submitted a  bipartisan, bicameral amicus brief  urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit Court's decision in  TikTok Inc. v. Garland  , which upheld the TikTok ban established under the  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.  In the brief, Senators Markey and Paul and Representative Khanna argued that the TikTok ban lacks evidence and directly conflicts with the First Amendment, undermining the rights of over 170 million Americans who use the platform. On December 19, Senators Markey and Paul sent a  letter  to President Joe Biden urging him to provide TikTok owner ByteDance with a 90-day extension to either sell TikTok or face the ban.

Washington (January 13, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey, a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, today delivered remarks on the U.S. Senate floor and live on TikTok regarding the consequences if TikTok is banned in the United States on January 19. Senator Markey also announced his plan to introduce legislation, the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Ac  t, to delay the deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban by an additional 270 days. 

Below is an excerpt from his remarks. 

“As the January 19th deadline approaches, TikTok creators and users across the nation are understandably alarmed. They are uncertain about the future of the platform, their accounts, and the vibrant online communities they have cultivated. 

“These communities cannot be replicated on another app. A ban would dismantle a one-of-a-kind informational and cultural ecosystem, silencing millions in the process. 

“The stakes here are high. That’s why I will soon introduce the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  to extend the deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban by an additional 270 days. 

“Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems. Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.” 

Senators Markey and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Congressman Ro Khanna (CA-17), recently submitted a  bipartisan, bicameral amicus brief  urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit Court's decision in  TikTok Inc. v. Garland  , which upheld the TikTok ban established under the  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.

10:35:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) released the following statement today on the hostage and ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas: 

“Today marks 467 days since October 7  th  , 2023, when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, massacred over 1,200 people, and took more than 240 hostages. 

The deal between Israel and Hamas is a critical step toward securing the release of all 98 people—including 7 Americans—who remain captive in Gaza, and the freedom of those who remain alive in unimaginable conditions. 

According to the public terms of the deal, 33 hostages will be released in its first phase, including women, children, men over the age of 50, and men under the age of 50 who are wounded and sick. In my meetings with released hostages and the families of hostages still held captive, I have heard unthinkable stories of the suffering they and their loved ones have endured, including torture and sexual violence. We will not rest until all the hostages come home, including the remains of those who have been murdered by Hamas. 

Crucially, this ceasefire will also allow a surge of aid into Gaza, bringing much-needed relief to Palestinian civilians who are experiencing a humanitarian crisis, especially in the midst of winter, when access to food, water, shelter, and medical supplies is key. 

I would like to thank President Biden and his team, as well as the incoming Trump Administration, for their persistent  ~~ joint  ~~ efforts to reach this deal. However, we must remain vigilant and continue working with guarantors, partners, and allies in the region to ensure that this long-awaited agreement is fully implemented, and that Hamas does not breach its terms. 

As I’ve said before, we must chart a path toward stability and security throughout the region, for Israelis, for Palestinians, and all who seek it. Peace is possible—but it cannot come as long as Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and its proxies continue to seek Israel’s destruction.”

10:35:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D. C. – U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens), New York’s senior member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, announced today that she has been selected as Ranking Member of the panel’s Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS), a key position to help determine funding for critical parts of the federal government. 

The Appropriations Committee is responsible for funding all of the federal government's agencies. The committee divides them into 12 subcommittees. Meng is the top democrat on the subcommittee that funds federal agencies including the Department of Commerce, Justice Department, NASA, National Science Foundation, and programs and projects that advance civil rights, trade, and technology. It writes legislation that provides money for law enforcement like the NYPD as well as entities in Queens such as colleges and universities, and programs that support small businesses. The subcommittee chair is held by Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY), while Meng serves as his Democratic partner. 

“It is an honor to serve as the Democratic leader for the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies and I thank my colleagues for selecting me,” said Meng. “As a senior member of the important and influential House Appropriations Committee, I have long advocated for federal investments in public safety and education, as well as efforts to create jobs and reduce costs for families – especially in Queens. As Ranking Member, I will work with my colleagues across the aisle to support our police officers, keep communities safe, strengthen our nation’s supply chains, lower prices, and ensure federal funding for programs that improve the lives of my constituents and all Americans.” 

Congresswoman Meng, who has represented Queens in Congress since 2013, was recently sworn in for her seventh term. She has been a member of the House Appropriations Committee since 2017, serving on both the CJS and State and Foreign Operations (SFOPS) subcommittees.

10:35:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate DOGE Caucus Chair Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is introducing the  Regulations Evaluated to Determine The Anticipated Price and Effect Act (RED TAPE) Act,  which prevents bureaucrats and agencies from fudging the numbers to hide how burdensome and expensive their regulations truly are. 

President Joe Biden issued  nearly 110,000 pages of regulations  last year,  the highest number ever.  From November 2023 to January 2025, the Biden administration issued  60 final rules  creating more than  $600 billion  in concealed regulatory expenses through the use of “net benefits” to obscure the actual cost of harmful regulations. One of the most prominent examples was when the Biden administration’s Department of Energy justified  Green New Deal-inspired energy standards  for household appliances by citing a $3.3 billion annual "savings" attributed to the so-called "Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases." 

“The real threat to our democracy is an unchecked bureaucracy,”  said Ernst.  “President Biden’s greenie math has added up to hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden regulatory costs for Americans, and enough is enough. I am putting a stop to this nonsense by breaking out my scissors and cutting through the RED TAPE.” 

House DOGE Caucus co-chair Pete Sessions (R-Texas) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 

“In 2023, the Biden-Harris administration issued guidance that directed government agencies to heavily incorporate non-monetary values into their cost-benefit analyses of proposed regulations. Instead of measuring the fiscal costs and benefits of a regulation, federal agencies are now assigning monetary value to obscure qualitative data,”  said Sessions.  “These regulations come at a cost to taxpayers, and there must be integrity, transparency, and a clear commitment to measurable results for the American people in this process. I am proud to work with Senator Ernst on this vital legislation to ensure mismanagement and waste are eliminated from our government.” 

“As DOGE Caucus Chair, Senator Ernst is delivering on her promises to bring about concrete changes with the  RED TAPE Act  ,"  said Peter Holland, Federal Affairs Director at the Foundation for Government Accountability.  “This bill puts an end to career bureaucrats hiding the real costs of their regulations behind vague, arbitrary justifications that only increase the size of government. Senator Ernst is leading the charge for transparency in the Senate, cutting through the red tape and protecting the hard-earned tax dollars of everyday Americans.”

Background: 

As chair of the Senate DOGE Caucus, Senator Ernst has unveiled a  $2 trillion plan  to cut down federal spending, save taxpayer dollars, and downsize the government in addition to her  telework report  that exposed an absent federal workforce. 

Her playbook has already racked up a  win  with the announcement of the sale of the Wilbur J. Cohen building, a 1.2 million square foot monument to waste, where just 72 of 3,341 workers were showing up to work.

10:35:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-Iowa)  Sarah’s Law  now has bipartisan support after U.S. Senator John Fetterman (D-Pa.) cosponsored this legislation. 

Sarah’s Law  is currently being considered as an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  , which is on the Senate floor this week. These bills work in tandem to close loopholes that have allowed illegal immigrants to commit violent crimes against Americans. 

“For years, I have worked tirelessly to pass  Sarah’s Law  to honor this young Iowan’s memory, hold illegal immigrants that cause bodily harm to our citizens accountable, and ensure this never happens again,”  Ernst said.  “I’m incredibly thankful to have Senator Fetterman’s support in this effort, so no American family in Iowa, Pennsylvania, or across our nation has to endure another tragedy at the hands of an illegal immigrant. I will continue to push to make this commonsense legislation law, and finally close the loopholes and protect Americans.” 

Background: 

This week, Ernst took to the Senate floor to  honor  Iowan Sarah Root, who died nine years ago at the hands of an illegal immigrant. 

On January 31, 2016, the night of her college graduation, Sarah Root, a 21-year-old from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit. Due to a loophole in federal law, her killer was released on bond and never seen again.

10:35:21 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:35:21 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is slamming the Biden administration’s new updates to the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit as out-of-touch and a barrier to American farmers trying to participate in the biofuel market. 

“This is yet another example of the Biden administration doing too little, too late, and pushing Green New Deal priorities at the expense of our hardworking farmers and biofuel producers,”  said Senator Ernst.  “After failing to provide meaningful guidance on 45Z last week, the Biden team’s latest attempt to pass the buck on biofuel policy continues to leave our farmers out in the cold and only further incentivizes the use of foreign feedstocks rather than American-grown crops. I am looking forward to working with President Trump so we can finally get our producers the certainty they deserve.” 

On Wednesday, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced changes to the GREET model used to calculate the level of credit biofuel producers can receive from 45Z  .  This comes just days after the  administration failed  to provide complete, meaningful guidance on 45Z and perpetuates the market uncertainty hurting Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers. 

While this updated GREET model addresses some of the  concerns  about the validity of used cooking oil imports from countries like China, it clearly lacks the necessary mechanisms for protecting American producers. The model published by DOE also completely ignores the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s proposed guidelines that incorporate Ernst’s  consistent calls  to properly utilize a larger menu of on-farm practices that farmers can implement in the field and eliminate the burdensome bundling mandate. Instead of incentivizing the use of crops grown by American farmers to expand the biofuel market, these failures will only continue – if not increase – the demand for foreign-based feedstocks. 

Background: 

Throughout her time in Congress, Ernst has also been a strong advocate for homegrown, Iowa biofuel, including by calling on the Biden White House to  make  E15 available year-round and country-wide,  expand  access to renewable fuel infrastructure necessary for bringing higher blends of biofuel to the pump,  amend  its harmful decision to set the Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) levels well below industry production capacity, and  raise  Renewable Fuel Standard volumes for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel.

10:35:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC), voted to affirm that President Trump has the authority to secure our southwest border immediately and called to build the wall to end Biden’s era of open borders. 

In November 2023, Ernst witnessed  firsthand  wall materials sitting unused near the border – ironically  surrounded  by their own fence. At today’s hearing, she pointed out this huge loss for taxpayers. Instead of being used for security,  $250 million of paid-for border wall materials  were wasted and stored for  $160,000 per month  before they were  auctioned off  for pennies on the dollar. 

During her questioning, witness Kenneth Cuccinelli, a former senior Department of Homeland Security official, confirmed that the Biden administration’s intentional abandonment of border wall materials was a part of its “open borders policy” and “part of that narrative” that invited illegal immigrants into our homeland. He also mentioned that walls help border patrol manage the flow of illegals, creating efficiency and safety. 

Watch Senator Ernst full questioning  here  . 

“We're talking about $250 million worth of materials that were purchased. They are paid for, and they could have bolstered our security but instead, we've just left them there to waste,”  said  Senator Ernst. 

Background: 

Ernst  demanded  President Biden put taxpayer-funded border wall materials to use. She led the  BUILD IT Act  and was an original cosponsor of the  FINISH IT Act  , which was  included  in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024  . 

In August 2024, she  conducted critical oversight  after it was  reported  that the Biden administration was auctioning off border wall materials, even though Congress had legislation moving forward to use them to build the wall. 

She also  blasted  the Biden administration for selling border materials for pennies on the dollar to a private buyer at a 96% discount. 

The border crisis has made every state a border state, and – to protect Iowans – Ernst continues to fight to pass  Sarah’s Law  to ensure any illegal immigrant who kills or harms an American is held accountable.

10:35:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) demanded that the Senate  pass  the  Laken Riley Act  and her  Sarah’s Law  to close loopholes in federal law that have caused a regular occurrence of innocent Americans falling victim to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. 

On January 31, 2016, the night of her college graduation, Sarah Root, a 21-year-old from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit. Due to a loophole in federal law, her killer was released on bond and never seen again. Since then, Ernst has  fought  tirelessly to pass  Sarah’s Law  to ensure this tragedy never happens again. 

  
Watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks  here  . 

Ernst’s full remarks: 

“Our nation, this body, and the American people are all too familiar with stories like Laken Riley’s, the 22-year-old nursing student beaten to death by an illegal immigrant – one who was already in police custody in New York City before being let go. 

“Unfortunately, after four years of Biden’s open border, this heartbreaking story has become too commonplace. 

“Hardly a day goes by without hearing of another American who has fallen victim to crimes perpetrated by the illegal immigrants the Biden administration let flood into our country. 

“And worse, too many times an illegal immigrant arrested for a violent crime posts bail, never to be heard from again – escaping through loopholes in the law. 

“This crisis only continues. 

“While these tragedies should have never happened in the first place – my colleagues and I are taking action to ensure they never happen again. 

“My legislation – Sarah’s Law – in conjunction with the Laken Riley Act – will close these loopholes, so our laws no longer prioritize illegal immigrants over our own citizens. 

“Working to secure the border and protect Americans is not a new fight to me, but it became personal nearly nine years ago. 

“The end of this month marks nine years since Iowans Michelle Root and Scott Root – who I know personally – woke up to every parent’s worst nightmare: their daughter, Sarah, was killed by a drunk driver – that was an illegal immigrant. 

“Sarah, and she is a beautiful young woman. She was 21-years-old. She was from Council Bluffs, and she had just graduated from Bellevue University in Nebraska with a 4.0 GPA. 

“She had her bachelor’s degree in criminal investigations. 

“She was headed home after celebrating this really important milestone with her family and her friends. 

“Sarah had her entire life ahead of her. 

“But instead, an illegal immigrant, Edwin Mejia – who was drunk driving with a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit, struck and killed her. 

“One would think Sarah’s killer would clearly meet Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ‘enforcement priorities.’ 

“But no. 

“Citing the Obama administration’s November 2014 memo, ICE declined to take custody of Mejia, despite his repeated driving offenses and history of skipping court dates. 

“Before the Root family could even lay Sarah to rest, her murderer posted bond, and was released, never to be seen again. 

“To rub salt in the wound, the Biden administration  removed  Mejia from ICE’s Most Wanted list. 

“Since then, I have warned repeatedly against the dangers of letting illegal immigrants – who have already broken our laws – roam the country and continue their lawlessness. 

“I have continually called on this body to step up and protect innocent Americans from criminals who are here in our country illegally and pass my bill – Sarah’s Law. 

“A loophole in the law means Sarah’s killer escaped justice. 

“But today, we can do something to ensure no other family has to go through the pain and the grief that Sarah’s parents, Scott and Michelle, still feel from that heartbreaking day. 

“My bill – named in Sarah’s honor – would close the alarming loophole that let Sarah’s killer go free. 

“It would simply require ICE to detain illegal immigrants charged with killing or seriously injuring another person – so they do not disappear before facing justice. 

“It’s common sense, folks. 

“No parent should have to endure the pain of losing a child like the Root family did. 

“But unfortunately, the Riley family is experiencing this same heartbreak. 

“Sarah and Laken’s deaths are both tragic and, unfortunately, are doomed to be repeated if we don’t close the loopholes in that law. 

“Those who come here illegally and harm our citizens should, without question, be detained so they face justice. 

“Again folks, this is common sense. 

“We can no longer prioritize illegal immigrants over public safety. 

“We must pass the Laken Riley Act and Sarah’s Law to send this message loud and clear – for Sarah’s family, for Laken’s family, and for the countless American families that this action would protect.

Inspectors general (IGs) supplied key details in Senator Ernst’s  $2 trillion roadmap  for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to eliminate waste and in her  telework report  that exposed an absent federal workforce that has abused locality pay to fleece taxpayers out of billions of dollars. 

“Inspectors general serve a vital role in uncovering waste in Washington and must be empowered to continue looking out for taxpayers,”  said Ernst.  “From identifying billion-dollar boondoggles to exposing a federal workforce that is permanently out of office, their work has been invaluable in my decade-long mission to uncover waste and make Washington squeal. I look forward to this caucus continuing to allow IGs to do tremendous work and find more ways to downsize government and eliminate inefficiencies.” 

Joining Senator Ernst in launching the caucus are Senators Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). 

“Inspectors General play an essential role in protecting taxpayer dollars and rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the executive branch,”  said  Grassley  . “I rely heavily on these independent watchdogs when carrying out my constitutional responsibility of oversight, and I’m glad to join Senator Ernst’s effort to support their invaluable work.” 

“Inspectors General are an essential bulwark against corruption, making sure that no one – no matter how powerful – is above the law,”  said Blumenthal.  “The Inspector General Caucus solidifies our commitment to investigating wrongdoing and increasing public trust in our government. I look forward to continuing my work promoting accountability and transparency and protecting the American people from waste and grift.” 

“Cutting waste at every level of government requires supporting those who can identify it,”  said Lankford.  “Inspectors General (IG) have long helped to root out wasteful projects and abuse of government programs. This caucus will work to further the mission of DOGE by empowering the IG community to continue their work to call out waste when they see it.” 

“Inspectors General play a critical role in rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal government and the bipartisan Congressional Inspector General Caucus will help build support for the important work that Inspectors General do,”  said Hassan  . “As co-chair of the Inspector General Caucus, I will continue to work with my colleagues to strengthen the oversight of federal spending and protect taxpayer dollars.” 

“I’m proud to be a Vice Chair of the new Senate Inspectors General Caucus. The federal government relies on Inspectors General to conduct independent oversight and combat waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars,"  said Peters.  "The creation of this Caucus demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that Inspectors General have the resources and tools to continue their vital work of safeguarding taxpayer dollars." 

“IGs remain committed to providing independent, objective, and effective oversight of Federal programs and operations. Last year alone, the IG community identified savings to Federal programs totaling  over $93 billion  ,”  said the Honorable Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Chairperson of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), IG for the Small Business Administration, and Acting IG for the Social Security Administration.  “The Federal IG community looks forward to working with the bipartisan IG Caucus and Congressional leaders to enhance efforts to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, improve government efficiency, and deliver for the American public.”

10:35:24 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Abraham Accords Caucus co-chair, released the following statement after an  announcement  that hostages held by Iran-backed Hamas will be released. 

Ernst has been a fierce  advocate  for freeing the hostages and kept up the  drumbeat  to bring them home. 

“The living nightmare these hostages have been forced to endure for 466 long days is finally coming to an end,”  said Ernst  . “Since Iran-backed Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack that shed American blood, I have called for our citizens’ immediate release, met with their families, told their stories, and worked with our partners to end this crisis. Today’s announcement is a sure sign that peace through strength works. I look forward to working with the Trump administration to restore American leadership, strengthen our bonds with Israel, and build upon the Abaham Accords – something Iran fears. I will not rest until our fellow citizens are freed and home.” 

Background: 

On October 7, 2023, she was in the Middle East and  went to Israel  just days after Iran-backed Hamas’ attacks to show her support for our ally. In the wake of the horrific terrorist assault, Ernst  met  with the hostage families in Israel and has remained in close contact with them. A few weeks later, Senator Ernst  demanded  President Biden do everything in his power to rescue the American hostages and bring them home safely. 

In January 2024, she  returned  to the Middle East and advocated for the release of the hostages in meetings with senior leadership and led negotiators in Egypt, Israel, Qatar, and Bahrain. In May 2024, she was in Israel when she received  reports  that the United States withheld an ammunition shipment to Israel and immediately  demanded  answers from President  Biden to hold him accountable  for his “ironclad” commitment to our greatest ally in the Middle East. In August 2024, Ernst  led  a Congressional delegation into Israel that met with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm support for our ally in the Middle East and reiterate the importance of bringing the hostages home. 

Senator Ernst  hosted  Hagit and Ruby Chen, the parents of American hostage Itay Chen, as her guests for the State of the Union in 2024. 

In July 2024, Ernst  led  a bipartisan group of senators in telling the stories of the American hostages on the U.S. Senate floor and calling for an end to the uncertainty their families have endured since October 7  th  .

10:35:25 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:35:25 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – As we near the 9  th  anniversary of a young Iowan’s death at the hands of an illegal immigrant driving drunk, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is continuing her push for  Sarah’s Law  to honor the memory of Sarah Root and close the loophole in federal law that allowed her killer to escape justice when he was released by federal law enforcement. 

Ernst’s bill will work in tandem with the  Laken Riley Act  to close loopholes in federal law that have caused a regular occurrence of innocent Americans falling victim to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. 

“Sarah Root had her entire life ahead of her before it was senselessly taken by someone who never should have been in this country,”  said Ernst.  “Her family has been forced to endure a living nightmare without closure because a glaring loophole in the law has allowed her killer to remain on the run for nearly nine years. For years, I have worked tirelessly to pass  Sarah’s Law  to honor her memory, hold illegal immigrants that cause bodily harm to our citizens accountable, and ensure this never happens again. I will not give up this fight for justice, because our laws should not prioritize illegal immigrants over the safety of Americans.” 

“Our family is very grateful for Senator Ernst and her willingness to continue to push for Sarah's Law. Senator Ernst continues to work tirelessly throughout the years to get this law passed. This law is to make sure no other family has to go through what our family has. We are coming up on 9 years since our beautiful Sarah was taken from us and there is no reason this law shouldn't have passed within that time. Sarah's killer is still on the run and if this law was in place when she was killed, we wouldn't be looking for her killer today – he would be in custody and serving his time,”  said Michelle Root, Sarah’s mother. 

Joining Senator Ernst in introducing  Sarah’s Law  are Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), John Curtis (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and John Kennedy (R-La.). 

“Nine years ago, Sarah Root’s young life was cut short by an illegal immigrant driving under the influence. The system failed Sarah, as her killer was released and never seen again after federal immigration authorities refused to detain him,”  said  Grassley  . “Our bill, named in Sarah’s memory, would protect American citizens and ensure criminal illegal immigrants aren’t able to escape justice.” 

“Almost nine years ago, 21-year-old Sarah Root was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving while drunk. Instead of answering for his crimes, the illegal immigrant posted bail, was released from jail, and fled our country never to be seen again. This egregious loophole in federal law must be closed so that victims like Sarah receive justice and criminals do the hard time they deserve,”  said Rep. Feenstra  . “Sarah’s Law ensures that any illegal immigrant who injures or kills an American citizen is swiftly detained and punished to the fullest extent of the law. In honor of Sarah, who was taken far too soon, we must restore law and order in our country to protect our families and communities.” 

"Record numbers of criminal aliens were apprehended attempting to enter illegally under the Biden administration and shameful data show that there are now at least 13,376 aliens in the United States convicted of homicide. Congress has a responsibility to work with the Trump administration to ensure that criminal aliens are held accountable and American communities are protected - Sarah's Law is key to accomplishing just that. FAIR applauds Senator Ernst for introducing this critical legislation and looks forward to it becoming law,"  said Federation for American Immigration Reform Executive Director Julie Kirchner. 

Sarah’s Law  amends the mandatory detention provisions of the  Immigration and Nationality Act  to require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. It also requires that upon encountering an illegal immigrant subject to mandatory detention, ICE must make reasonable efforts to identify victims and inform their families of certain information.

Background: 

On January 31, 2016, the night of her college graduation, Sarah Root, a 21-year-old from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit. Due to a loophole in federal law, her killer, Edwin Mejia, was released on bond and never seen again. 

Since this tragedy, Senator Ernst has been working  tirelessly  to pass  Sarah’s Law  and close this loophole to bring closure to the Root family and ensure this never happens again. 

When Senator Ernst called on the Senate to pass this commonsense legislation on May 2024, Senate Democrats  blocked  her effort.

10:35:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: RED OAK, Iowa – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today announced her Small Business of the Week: Boomerang Corporation of Jones County. Throughout the 119th Congress, Chair Ernst plans to recognize a small business in every one of Iowa’s 99 counties. 

“Living up to its name, Boomerang Corporation is committed to projects that both begin and end with them,”  said Chair Ernst  . “At its Anamosa headquarters, construction isn’t just about building roads or laying concrete, it’s about creating pathways for the community to thrive. For over twenty-five years, founder Bryce Ricklefs has worked to break ground on projects, overcome infrastructure challenges, and deliver high-quality results.” 

In 1998, Bryce Ricklefs opened Ricklefs Excavating to support construction projects in the Anamosa community. As time went on, he began seeking larger grading and excavation opportunities. He expanded to include wastewater management, roadwork, and large-scale infrastructure projects. In 2017, Bryce rebranded to Boomerang Corporation and continues to plan, design, and oversee projects across Eastern Iowa. They use trenchless technology to replace pipes with minimal destruction. Boomerang Corporation has grown to employ 200 community members and looks forward to celebrating its 27th anniversary in Iowa this September. 

Stay tuned as Chair Ernst recognizes more Iowa small businesses across the state with her Small Business of the Week award.

10:35:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – With the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)  warning  its authority is expiring, U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Chair Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) took swift action to ensure it will be able to continue to track down criminals who stole COVID relief designed for small businesses. 

She led several of her Republican colleagues in introducing the  Complete COVID Collections Act,  which would extend authorization of the SIGPR through 2030 and expand its jurisdiction to cover other Small Business Administration (SBA) COVID-related programs to empower it to go after fraudsters stealing from taxpayers. 

“Con artists took advantage of small businesses’ pain during COVID to defraud government programs designed to help hardworking Americans,”  said Ernst.  “While we are $36 trillion in debt, we especially cannot afford to leave more than $200 billion floating around, especially in the hands of fraudsters. My Republican colleagues and I are making sure that all resources are available in this fight to get taxpayers’ money back and hold these criminals accountable.” 

Click  here  to view the bill text, which was sponsored by Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and John Curtis (R-Utah). 

Background: 

While SBA ran the relief programs on a “first come, first serve” basis, the money ran out quickly, and many qualifying businesses were turned away as  felons  ,  gang members  , and  drug traffickers  raked in cash. Some swindlers uploaded  pictures of Barbie dolls as photo identification  on SBA loan applications that were approved. 

One alleged fraudster took home  $8 million  while  nearly 2,000 struggling restaurants in Iowa  were left empty-handed. Ernst detailed this in her report titled  Small Business COVID-19 Fraud: Three Years Later State of Play  –  where she outlined the Biden SBA’s effort to discount the full extent of fraud and cast doubt on the legitimate estimates made by expert investigators. 

Ernst’s tireless advocacy  forced  the Biden administration to eventually take action to recover billions in COVID aid in January 2024.

The legislators have worked with the U.S. Department of State and the Dutch Government to return several cultural and religious items. The Pueblo made numerous, yet unsuccessful, efforts over many years to communicate with the Museum for the items, which were taken from the Pueblo by Dutch anthropologist Herman F.C. Ten Kate in December of 1882. 

Heinrich signed an Escobar-led a letter to the Dutch Government in June and a letter to Brigitta Tazelaar, Netherlands Ambassador to the United States, in September, in addition to several meetings and phone calls with relevant stakeholders, including U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal. Alongside Heinrich, this effort was joined by U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján and U.S. Representatives Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.). 

“For years, I've fought alongside Tribes, including Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, to recover and return Tribal cultural items that were stolen decades ago and have been in private collections ever since,”  said Heinrich.  “The STOP Act, which I passed into law in 2022, has given the United States new tools to advocate for return of these sacred items to the communities where they belong. I am so glad to see these items will finally be returned home, after a decades-long repatriation effort by Pueblo leaders, advocates, and lawmakers." 

“Today’s news rectifies a long injustice for our community,”  said Escobar.  “My team and I have tirelessly worked to return these precious artifacts for over a year. I join everyone from the Pueblo tribe in rejoicing that these artifacts and their history will be preserved for generations to come. I'm grateful to the Dutch Government for their willingness to right this wrong and to the State Department for their help bringing such sacred objects back to their rightful home”

Specifically, the federal funding will support homelessness prevention, rapid rehousing, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing. The awards also include funding for youth and survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. 

“Every New Mexican deserves a safe and stable place to live,”  said Heinrich.  “I’m pleased to welcome this historic federal investment that will help give more families and individuals, including youth, a stable and safe place to call home and the opportunity to thrive.” 

“Everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home. That's why I'm proud to welcome $17.2 million in funding to support homeless assistance across New Mexico,”  said Luján.  “This crucial investment will help provide essential resources, shelter, and services to individuals and families in need, helping ensure we are supporting our most vulnerable communities and that more New Mexicans have the opportunity to succeed.” 

“Home is more than a roof over your head, it’s a space to create memories and feel safe. This $17.2 million is a testament to the commitment of the Biden-Harris administration to improve the life of every American,”  said Leger Fernández.  “I’m grateful to see that $6.9 million of this funding will help provide resources for New Mexicans in my district. These are necessary investments to combat the homelessness crisis across our country.” 

“It is estimated that almost 20,000 people in New Mexico experience homelessness each year,”  said Stansbury.  “That is why I am so grateful to HUD for allocating almost $17.2 million to programs in New Mexico tackling this crisis. HUD’s Continuum of Care Program will continue to be a backbone for New Mexico’s non-profits and organizations to continue their on-the-ground care for our communities.” 

“As someone deeply committed to ensuring that every New Mexican has a safe place to call home, I am proud to see over $17 million in federal funds secured to address homelessness across our state. In particular, these resources will bolster projects in our district, such as Community of Hope and Valencia Shelter Services for Victims of Domestic Violence, which provide critical support for families and individuals facing housing instability. These investments reaffirm our dedication to tackling homelessness head-on and building stronger, more supportive communities,”  said Vasquez. 

HUD’s Continuum of Care program is the backbone federal program supporting community homelessness response systems across the country, providing grants to nonprofit providers, States, Tribes, and local governments for permanent and short-term housing assistance, supportive services, planning, data, and other costs. 

The nationwide total of nearly $3.6 billion announced today represents the largest-ever amount of Continuum of Care program funding awarded to communities to address homelessness in history and provides a critical expansion of resources at a time when rates of homelessness are rising in most communities.

WASHINGTON – During his opening remarks to consider Governor Doug Burgum for the U.S. Secretary of Interior, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, emphasized the need for the U.S. Secretary of Interior to protect our nation’s public lands, waters, and wildlife and fulfill our nation’s promises to Tribal Nations. 

VIDEO: Heinrich Delivers Opening Remarks in Hearing to Consider Burgum for Interior Secretary 

Heinrich also highlighted the necessity for the incoming Interior Secretary to address and mitigate the effects of climate change, particularly as we see the horrific wildfires in California, and long-term aridification of the Western U.S. Lastly, Heinrich stressed the need for steadfast leadership at the Interior Department to garner our public lands’ clean energy potential to create jobs, build new economic opportunities, and meet growing energy demands in New Mexico and across the country. 

“There are some who argue that the very existence of public lands—places like Yosemite National Park or the Bitterroot National Forest — is unconstitutional,”  Ranking Member Heinrich said  . “But Americans know that idea of lands that belong to everyone, no matter where they live or who their parents are or how thick or thin their wallet is, is one of the foundational ideas of our nation. I hope you will join me in keeping public lands in public hands.” 

Senator Heinrich’s full remarks as prepared for delivery are below. 

Governor Burgum, welcome to the Energy & Natural Resources Committee. 

We had a good conversation last week, and I’m looking forward to hearing your answers to our questions today. 

I want to begin by acknowledging the horrific wildfires in California over the last couple of weeks. 

My thoughts are with all those displaced by the fires and with every firefighter and first responder who is fighting to save these communities. 

The Department of the Interior has responsibility for an incredibly broad array of issues — from conserving the places Americans love to spend time with their families, to protecting and recovering our most iconic wildlife species, to delivering water to cities and farms in the West, to fulfilling our nation’s trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations. 

Any job that involves responsibilities ranging from elementary school students to bison is really quite the job. 

Public lands are where we go to hike, camp, hunt, and fish. 

They are where our veterans to go seek the peace and solitude that their service to our country could not always provide. 

There are some who argue that the very existence of public lands — places like Yosemite National Park or the Bitterroot National Forest — is unconstitutional. 

But Americans know that idea of lands that belong to everyone, no matter where they live or who their parents are or how thick or thin their wallet is, is one of the foundational ideas of our nation. 

I hope you will join me in keeping public lands in public hands. 

The Interior Department is also the leader in meeting our nation’s trust responsibility to Tribal Nations and upholding the treaty commitments we as a nation made to tribes and their members. 

As a nation, we routinely fall short of meeting those commitments. We can and must do better. 

As the relentless pace of climate change brings bigger floods, hotter summers, and diminished snowpack, it’s also driving the long-term aridification of the Western US. 

Over the next 50 years, New Mexico will have 25 percent less water than we do today. 

And we are not alone. 

The Colorado River, which provides drinking water to 40 million people, irrigates billions of dollars’ worth of crops, and provides essential habitat for fish and wildlife, will likely never return to its early 20  th  Century flows. 

Through the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of the Interior must play an active role in helping the West transition to our new water reality. 

The Interior Department is also an energy department. 

As we make the necessary transition to a clean-energy economy, the land and water managed by the department will play an indispensable role in producing the energy we need — as well as facilitating the transmission lines that are essential to meet surging demand in electricity. 

From geothermal and hydrogen to solar and wind energy, the Department’s work is at the center of our energy future. 

Governor, I look forward to hearing your plans on all these topics and more.

WASHINGTON -  During a hearing to consider Governor Doug Burgum’s for the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Senator Martin Heinrich  (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, received commitments from Burgum to seek critical input from local leaders and stakeholders, and consult with Tribal leaders before the Department considers making conservation designation changes to public lands in New Mexico and across the country. Heinrich also received a commitment from Burgum to prioritize Tribal water rights settlements. 

Additionally, Heinrich highlighted the significance of the outdoor recreation’s massive economic impact, questioning Burgum on how he would sustain and support this essential industry.

On Heinrich securing Governor Burgum’s commitment to seek local input and consult with Tribal leaders when the Department seeks to make wholesale conservation designation to public lands  : 

“I would just simply ask that before the Department makes wholesale changes to conservation designations in the state of New Mexico, at least, that you would meet with myself and any local leaders who help to create those designations in the first place,”  Senator Heinrich questioned  . 

“I think yes, absolutely,”  Governor Burgum responded.  “We'd look forward to those discussions with you and, I think, again, as you've described, the key to this is the local consultation. 

“My experience as Governor and working with the Tribes and working with local communities in North Dakota, whether it's grazing associations, county commissioners, mayors, rural residents, I think the consultation is key,”  Governor Burgum continued. 

“And part of that consultation is also those Tribes that have both current and historic connections to those places as well, right,”  Senator Heinrich pressed  . 

“Absolutely,”  Governor Burgum responded  . 

On Heinrich securing Governor Burgum’s commitment to bolster outdoor recreation: 

“As a former outfitter guide, I'm excited that this body just passed the EXPLORE Act,”  said Senator Heinrich  . “It's the first major piece of outdoor recreation legislation, and it's the kind of recognition of the big economic driver of our public lands that often doesn't get the same attention that energy and other uses get.” 

“Outdoor recreation in New Mexico is responsible for something like 29 million jobs and billions of dollars of impact. On a national scale, it generates over a trillion dollars to our economy,”  Senator Heinrich continued  , “So, talk a little about how we can… support that outdoor recreation economy.” 

“First, I would just like to say this is a really important topic, but it's also a passion of mine as someone who has spent my life as an avid outdoorsman,”  Governor Burgum responded.  “I was very pleased to get the full endorsement of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable for this job ,which represents that trillion dollar industry.” 

“As governor, we created an office of outdoor recreation and continue to invest in it, whether that's access to fishing and hunting, public access on public lands,”  Governor Burgum continued.  “We've been able to find tools to bring together land owners and sportsmen on both private lands as well as public lands to make sure that we can keep that outdoor economy growing.” 

On Heinrich securing Governor Burgum’s commitment to prioritize and solving Tribal water rights settlements: 

“Tribal water settlements are incredibly important for water certainty in the west, especially with all of the conflicts we have not just in the Colorado basin, but the Rio Grande, and other western basins  ,” said Senator Heinrich.  “If you are confirmed would you commit to continuing the department's work to both resolve legal claims around tribal water settlements, but also just implement the existing water settlements that have already been made?” 

“You have my commitment to work on those  ,” Governor Burgum responded.

WASHINGTON – During his opening remarks to consider Chris Wright for the U.S. Secretary of Energy, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, stressed the need for the U.S. Secretary of Energy to recognize New Mexico’s critical contributions to American energy, highlighting the significance of Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories to energy production, national security, and cybersecurity, confronting the climate crisis, the economy, and our nation’s leadership. 

Heinrich additionally stressed the need for the Secretary of Energy to adapt to a rapidly evolving energy landscape and implement the historic investments Congress passed to unlock American energy dominance driven by next generation advanced energy technologies. 

Heinrich began his remarks by expressing his frustration that Chairman Mike Lee (R-U.T.) decided to move forward with today’s hearing despite the Committee receiving critical information on Mr. Wright – financial disclosures and ethics documents – just 16 hours before the hearing. This comes after numerous attempts, including a  formal letter  from Heinrich and all eight Democrats and one Independent on the Committee, to ensure there is sufficient time to review submitted documents. 

“I must express my disappointment that the Chair has decided to move forward with this hearing over my objection that he has short changed his constitutional obligation to share critical oversight documents with the Ranking Member with adequate review time,”  said  Ranking Member Heinrich.  “Late last evening, my staff finally received critical documents that are required by our Committee rules and under the law. This missing information is essential to evaluate any nominees' potential conflicts of interest, financial holdings both foreign and domestic, questionable ties to other nations, and susceptibility to blackmail, among other significant concerns.” 

Senator Heinrich’s full remarks as prepared for delivery are below. 

Thank you, Chairman Lee. 

Welcome to the new Members of this Committee, and returning Members. 

It is an honor to address you today as the newly appointed Ranking Member of this Committee. 

I am honored to represent a state whose economy and identity are so deeply connected to DOE’s mission. Sandia and Los Alamos rank among the state's largest employers, offering stable, mission-driven jobs to nearly 30,000 people. 

In 2023, their combined economic impact on the state reached nearly 9 billion dollars. 

These investments have fueled research, development, and scientific progress, driving global advancements in fields such as nuclear science, cybersecurity, clean energy, and materials science. 

Before continuing with my remarks, I must express my disappointment that the Chair has decided to move forward with this hearing over my objection that he has short changed his constitutional obligation to share critical oversight documents with the Ranking Member with adequate review time. 

Late last evening, my staff finally received critical documents that are required by our Committee rules and under the law. 

This missing information is essential to evaluate any nominees' potential conflicts of interest, financial holdings both foreign and domestic, questionable ties to other nations, and susceptibility to blackmail, among other significant concerns. 

Many other Senate Committees waited to notice their hearing until all the required paperwork had been received and members had adequate time to review. 

Giving members less than 24 hours to review these documents, most of them occurring at night, does not fulfill this Committee’s duties to “advice and consent” on nominations before it. 

Mr. Wright, it is unfortunate that our first order of business involved breaking Committee precedents. 

Nevertheless, because my concerns have gone unheeded, we shall proceed. 

Some Secretaries in years past have even been surprised to learn that almost half DOE’s budget supports the nation’s nuclear security enterprise through the National Nuclear Security’s Administration and the cleanup of legacy nuclear waste from weapons production during the Cold War through the Office of Environmental Management. 

And although only a fraction of its budget goes to energy research, DOE is still the largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences, not just through the Office of Science, but also through the Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. 

The Secretary of Energy must recognize the importance of DOE’s research and development programs and the National Labs, not just for energy production, but also for efficient energy use, national security, cybersecurity, climate change, and maintaining our position of leadership in the world. 

The Secretary of Energy must also adapt to a rapidly evolving energy landscape, driven by three empirical trends: 

First, electricity demand is growing. Advances in generative artificial intelligence technologies, and investments in manufacturing and data centers are driving up electricity demand. Nationwide electric demand is expected to grow by 15 percent in the next 5 years. 

Second, distributed renewable energy is getting cheaper. 

The deployment of renewable energy continues to accelerate exponentially, consistently outpacing EIA predictions year over year. 

The pace of this deployment is driving down energy costs—giving Americans more “energy freedom” to choose how they want to heat and cool their homes and fuel their cars and trucks. 

Third, clean energy is driving economic growth  .  According to International Energy Agency, clean energy accounted for 10 percent of global GDP growth in 2023. 

If confirmed, Mr. Wright, you will inherit a Department that has received historic levels of federal investments to fund programs and policies that are transforming the U.S economy. 

These programs and policies were authorized by landmark legislation, including the Energy Act of 2020, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. 

And those investments are paying off: 

Two years after CHIPS and Science, companies have announced more than 395 billion dollars of investments in semiconductors and electronics and the creation of over 115,000 jobs. 

Two years after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses, including battery manufactures and auto companies, have announced 493 billion dollars of investments, a 71 percent increase from the two-year period preceding the legislation. 

And three years after the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration announced $568 billion for over 66,000 projects across the country in November. 

These landmark laws gave the Secretary of Energy new resources and authorities to implement programs and policies that will unlock hundreds of gigawatts’ worth of solar, wind, and grid battery projects stuck in interconnection queues all around the country. 

This hearing will provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate to the Committee that you will implement Congress’ vision of energy abundance, and enforce and uphold the laws of the land. I look forward to the discussion.

“We must continue to pursue pathways to achieve a two-state solution, which remains crucial both for Palestinians’ sovereignty and self-determination and for Israel’s security in the region. We must continue to work toward a long-term, post-war plan that can achieve lasting peace in the region.”

Full text of the op-ed can be found below or read online,  here  . 

Our public lands are not for sale 

By U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich 

The place you first learned to fish or harvested your first elk. The campground your family went to on a long weekend. The trail you hiked to clear your head. The site that has held sacred cultural meaning for thousands of years. The awe-inspiring landscape you watched pass by on a long drive or the place your husband proposed to you. 

These are our public lands and your American birthright. 

They define our Western landscapes and identity. They are the heart of our way of life, where we create memories, seek out adventure, and hunt and fish to fill our freezers and feed our families. 

In a world full of things that you can only enjoy with a swipe of your debit card, these public lands and waters belong to all Americans — regardless of the size of our paychecks. In turn, these lands support a  thriving outdoor recreation economy  , sustain our rural communities and preserve our Western traditions. 

The state of Utah is trying to put all of that at risk. 

Utah Republican politicians  filed a federal lawsuit  last summer attempting a massive land grab that would have stripped protections for 18.5 million acres of America’s public lands. 

This maneuver, had it been successful, would have opened the door to privatization of public lands in states from New Mexico to Washington, Montana to California. That’s because Utah’s leaders — and  other Western officials who have signaled their support  — don’t actually want to “transfer” public lands to state management. They want to privatize them. 

And they likely would do so. The expense of managing these public lands — especially factoring in  the rising costs of managing increasingly catastrophic wildfire seasons  — would almost certainly bankrupt Western states’ governments. The only way the states could possibly balance their budgets while taking on new costs would be to drastically raise local taxes or to lease and even sell off large parcels of these public lands to the highest bidders. 

Our public lands system, on the other hand,  carefully manages these lands  to balance recreation, conservation and resource development. It also provides important protections for cultural resources and sacred sites. 

This is what ensures that the lands we love will be there for our grandchildren, and beyond. It’s how we protect the watersheds that our communities depend on. And it’s how we stop mega-billionaires from turning our American birthright into their fenced-off playgrounds. 

Utah’s attempted land grab isn’t new. In fact, exactly a decade ago  in a New York Times opinion column  , I warned about similar schemes that date back to 19th century railroad tycoons and cattle barons  . 

The attacks on our public lands are unrelenting, whether from anti-government militants like  illegal rancher Cliven Bundy  and his sons staging  violent confrontations with federal law enforcement  or the prior  appointment of anti-public lands zealot William Perry Pendley  — who believes the “Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government  to be sold.” 

Now, even with the  Supreme Court’s rejection of Utah’s lawsuit  , the state’s  multi-million dollar effort  to undermine and privatize federal public lands still may be the most existential threat yet. 

We must protect our public lands. 

Aldo Leopold, a visionary forester who helped protect some of our most treasured public lands in my home state of New Mexico and throughout the West, once wrote: “To those devoid of imagination, a blank space on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part.” 

The Utah leaders behind the reckless federal lawsuit may view our public lands as mere blank spots on the map, ripe for wealthy private landowners, commercial developers, oil and gas companies, and mining and timber interests. They’re wrong. 

Americans don’t want to find locked gates and “No Trespassing” signs when they go to spend the day with their family at their favorite lake or, as I’ve done on many occasions, chase Gambel’s quail on a patch of Bureau of Reclamation Land. 

The reality is that a  strong majority of Westerners  reject Utah’s shortsighted and purely extractive view of our public lands. That’s because we know how valuable these public lands are already. 

Plainly put, our public lands are not for sale. And the effort by Utah politicians to steal these places from future generations is un-American. 

Our grandkids deserve to know the freedom of standing in the middle of a vast landscape that stretches as far as you can see or in the midst of trees that stretch far above their heads. It’s their American birthright, no matter what’s in their bank account.

WASHINGTON — During Chris Wright’s confirmation hearing for U.S. Secretary of Energy, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, received a commitment from Mr. Wright to visit New Mexico’s National Labs in his first year and divest from his business interests to ensure transparency and accountability. In addition, Heinrich secured Wright’s commitment to continue to support transmission projects in New Mexico and across the country, which will build our middle class, lower energy costs, and support high-quality jobs that working people can build their families around. 

On Mr. Wright’s commitment to visiting New Mexico’s National Labs, which employ nearly 30,000 people and spur research, development, and scientific progress, driving global advancements in fields such as nuclear science, cybersecurity, clean energy, and materials science: 

Heinrich began his questioning, “  Would you commit to visiting Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories in your first year as Secretary?” 

Wright responded,  “Thank you, Senator. I will absolutely commit to visit those two prestigious and hallowed institutions and would love to coordinate with your staff and if at all possible, we could visit together. I am a huge fan of those two institutions and look forward to walking their halls.” 

Heinrich reiterated the need for Mr. Wright to divest from any financial holdings or other interests that could create a conflict of interest: 

Heinrich asked,  “I would like you to talk a little bit about your divestment plans. You mentioned a lot of work in the energy space and we had a conversation about the need to maintain not only the avoidance of conflict of interest, but also the avoidance of appearance of conflict of interest. Can you talk about your plans for divestment? 

Wright responded,  “I agree with all of that, Senator. I have been a lifelong entrepreneur in the energy space. And of course, I have submitted my disclosures for all of my work and the appropriate ethics counselors within the federal government… The appropriate ethics people have reviewed my ethics, my personal holdings, and other interests, and I have agreed to take all the appropriate action to avoid any real conflict or perceived conflict of interest. I am fully aligned with you there, Senator. 

On Mr. Wright’s response to support and expand transmission projects to meet skyrocketing demand for power, increase reliability, save customers money, and support high-quality jobs for working people: 

Heinrich remarked,  “I am actually wearing my dad's IBEW 60-year pin today because it reminds me of the importance of that grid. DOE's Grid Deployment Office has supported a lot of really valuable projects through the Transmission Facilitation Program, including the Southline Transmission Project in my home state. These projects will save customers money, and they increase grid reliability. Can you assure me at a time when things like Project 2025 have proposed eliminating the Grid Deployment Office that DOE will continue to use its authorities and resources to support the kind of transmission projects that increase liability and save customers money? 

Wright responded,  “Senator, thank you for your dad's service in building our grid and maintaining it with a gorgeous track record all those years. And yes, I am aligned with you and will seek to find the best ways to improve our transmission grid, including expansion in new lines.”

10:35:36 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:35:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) announced  $120 million  for Fiscal Year 2025 for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project using funding from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Reclamation Water Settlements Fund. 

The Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project was first authorized in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which settled the Navajo Nation’s water rights in the San Juan River Basin of New Mexico. Upon completion, this project will provide a sustainable water supply from the San Juan River to roughly 43 Chapters of the Navajo Nation, the southwestern portion of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and the City of Gallup, all of which currently rely on a rapidly diminishing groundwater supply. 

In August, the N.M. Delegation was pleased to welcome a $267 million Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project contract to design and build the San Juan Lateral Water Treatment Plant in northwest New Mexico. The plant is the largest and most important feature of the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project.  Together with today’s announcement, the total investment for the project is $487 million. 

“Today, we are delivering on our promise to the Navajo Nation to fund this infrastructure project that will deliver clean, reliable water to 43 Tribal communities and the City of Gallup. We secured significant investments for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project through our Infrastructure Law. Now it’s time we get the project fully completed,”  said Ranking Member Heinrich.  “Communities in northwest New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation deserve water security and clean drinking water. I am committed to delivering the resources families need and deserve.” 

"Access to safe, reliable drinking water is a basic right and crucial for public health. That’s why I’m proud to have helped secure $120 million for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. I’m grateful to Secretary Haaland and the Department of the Interior for their support,”  said Luján, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.  “This issue has been a priority for me since I introduced the original Navajo-Gallup Water Supply legislation in the House of Representatives. I also introduced legislation to amend the project, ensuring it has the resources and time needed to deliver clean drinking water to communities in northwestern New Mexico. I previously secured $137 million for the project through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I'll continue working to complete this project. This is an issue of living up to our trust responsibility to Tribes and delivering essential rights to Nations. This is a critical step forward and I remain committed to fighting for Tribes and Pueblos.” 

“We worked hard to raise the funding ceiling for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project in the contentious end of year funding fight because we knew this $120 million would get us a step closer to delivering clean, reliable water to communities on the Navajo Nation, Jicarilla Apache Nation, and across northwestern New Mexico,”  said Leger Fernández.  “This long-term project will bring drinking water to 250,000 people and the completion of this water project is essential for upholding our federal trust responsibility to Tribal nations. This project also benefits the surrounding communities of Gallup and allows hospitals and key improvements to be built. I will keep fighting to provide the infrastructure to sustain New Mexican communities for generations to come.” 

“I want to thank Senator Heinrich, Senator Luján, and Rep. Leger Fernández for their tireless advocacy on behalf of the Navajo Nation and for securing the language in the Continuing Resolution to allow this funding to become possible. With this funding, we are even closer to bringing a safe and reliable water supply to our people. We are confident that with their advocacy that Congress will pass the entirety of the Navajo Gallup Water Supply Project Amendments Act,”  Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said. 

“For many years, the City of Gallup has relied on dwindling groundwater resources that are increasingly expensive and difficult to develop,”  said Mayor Louie Bonaguidi.  “Water from the San Juan River constitutes the only available and economically viable long term supply, and is therefore essential to – and guarantees – the City’s future. In economic terms, the project is a ‘game changer’ for the City. We are very happy that Congresswomen Leger-Fernández and Stansbury, Senators Luján and Heinrich, and other members of the State’s delegation, working with the Bureau of Reclamation, have been able to secure additional funding for the project.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced today that two of his bipartisan bills — the  Simplifying Outdoor Access for Recreation (SOAR) Act  and  Every Kid Outdoors Extension Act  —  were signed into law as part of the  Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences (EXPLORE) Act  . The broader bipartisan package will bolster outdoor recreation and promote public lands in New Mexico and across the United States. 

The SOAR Act  will streamline and improve the permitting process for outfitters, educational organizations, and community groups to access public land. This legislation, co-led with U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), was supported by a wide range of organizations, including the Wilderness Society, American Mountain Guides Association, The Mountaineers, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, and the Outdoor Industry Association. 

The Every Kid Outdoors Extension Act  will extend free access to national parks and other public lands to all American fourth grade students and their families, through 2031. This legislation, co-led with U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.), garnered widespread support, including endorsements from The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, and the Outdoor Alliance for Kids. 

“My bills to simplify access to outdoor recreation and provide all American fourth graders and their families free access to national parks are now law,”  said Heinrich.  “Our legislation will make it easier for outfitters, families, schools, and community groups to get outside and enjoy our public lands. This will grow local small businesses and our state’s recreation economy – while creating jobs New Mexicans can build their families around.”

10:35:38 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  –  U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and U.S. Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) welcomed $231 million in federal funding for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC) and Village of Questa, N.M. Green Hydrogen Project from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Empowering Rural America (New ERA) Program  . 

This funding will support the construction of 104 megawatts of clean, renewable energy from hydrogen and solar facilities with battery energy storage systems in rural New Mexico. The project will power nearly 25,000 homes annually and reduce climate pollution by 98,000 tons each year — equivalent to removing over 20,700 gasoline-powered cars from the road. It will create up to 350 jobs during construction and generate approximately $298 million in economic output, with a total tax impact of more than $44 million over the next five years. This critical renewable project, combined with other initiatives, will significantly reduce KCEC's overall power costs for its members. 

“I’m proud to welcome $231 million for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative’s innovative green hydrogen project — a transformative investment that I’ve proudly supported and advocated for  ,” said Heinrich, Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  “New Mexico has the expertise and ability to be a world leader in advanced energy solutions. This first-of-its-kind project will help us achieve this goal – all while creating new, high-quality jobs for the Village of Questa, lowering energy costs, and generating more clean, reliable power for rural communities in northern New Mexico. Kit Carson and its local partners are working to create a better, healthier future for the next generation to inherit, and putting New Mexico on the cutting edge while they do it.” 

“This investment is a major step forward to bolster clean energy production and strengthen local economies in northern New Mexico. I’m proud to welcome $231 million in funding for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative’s green hydrogen project which will help power homes, lower costs, and create new job opportunities,”  said Luján  . “Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve been proud to champion investments for Kit Carson and the Village of Questa, and I’ll continue working to deliver for all New Mexicans.” 

"When the Mayor of Questa first told me about this clean hydrogen project, I knew I would do whatever I could to help get it off the ground. It has everything you would want—transforming a mine that employed thousands but left behind environmental contamination and a community in need of jobs, a technology to generate energy in as clean a manner as possible, and visionary leadership at Kit Carson and the local elected officials,"  said Leger Fernández.  "This $231 million-dollar investment in Kit Carson Electric Cooperative's green hydrogen project is a shining example of how New Mexico is leading the way toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future for our enchanted economy. By creating hundreds of good-paying jobs, lowering energy costs, and cutting harmful emissions, this project will empower northern New Mexico's communities while making sure we leave a healthier planet for our children and grandchildren." 

“The funding award opportunity from the New ERA Program through the Rural Utilities Service would go toward the KCEC and Village of Questa, NM Green Hydrogen Project, an innovative clean energy project benefiting the entire KCEC service territory in northern New Mexico,”  said  KCEC CEO Luis A. Reyes Jr  . “This innovative project is equal parts bold and achievable. By repurposing reclaimed water from a closed mine for green hydrogen generation, we are providing our member owners a way to control a brighter future for an area in need of economic development within a state laser focused on sustainable and reliable energy solutions.”

10:35:41 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:35:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and U.S. Representatives Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), and Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) welcomed $172,299,188 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to support a series of infrastructure projects to enhance connectivity and safety for rail, pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists across several New Mexico communities. These projects are made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a landmark piece of legislation that has brought billions of dollars in infrastructure investments to New Mexico, continuing to drive critical improvements across the state. 

“These grants are exactly the transformative investments that New Mexicans deserve from our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This federal funding will re-envision street safety in Gallup, build safer highways near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in southeastern NM, deliver a new road that will help Las Cruces grow, build new infrastructure to help the Rail Runner better serve families from Belen to Santa Fe, and improve public transit for the Mescalero Apache Tribe and the Pueblo of Taos. Combined, this funding reflects what we set out to do with our Infrastructure Law: improve safety for everyone using our roads, grow local economies, lower transportation costs, and create high-quality jobs New Mexicans can build their families around,”  said Heinrich  , “I am proud to have worked with the Biden Administration and Secretary Buttigieg to deliver these needed investments in our communities.” 

“I am proud to welcome over $172 million for projects that will enhance safety and connectivity across our state. These projects will ensure safer roads for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists, while making our rail systems safer and strengthening the links between our communities,”  said Luján.  “This funding, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is a critical investment in the future of New Mexico, and these projects will help create a more efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation network for years to come.” 

“From safer roads in Santa Fe to enhanced transit for the Pueblo of Taos and Mescalero Apache Tribe, these projects are about improving safety, connectivity, and opportunity for everyone. These over $172 million will transform road and rail safety for our comunidades,”  said Leger Fernández.  “Thanks to the Biden/Harris Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re building a stronger, more equitable future for New Mexico, one that supports jobs, reduces costs, and ensures our transportation systems work for all.” 

"Updated and well-maintained infrastructure lays the groundwork to move communities forward. Thank you to President Biden and the Department of Transportation for supporting safe transportation in New Mexico,"  said Stansbury  . "The over $172 million for projects across the state, including several in the First Congressional District, will bring construction jobs to our state and is transformational as New Mexico grows." 

“Investing in safer roads and modernized infrastructure is key to supporting economic growth and ensuring the well-being of our communities,”  said Vasquez.  “ These projects reflect our commitment to addressing rural and underserved areas' unique needs. These investments will improve daily commutes, enhance safety for workers in the energy sector and lay the foundation for future economic opportunities.” 

Projects Receiving DOT Funding: 

The City of Las Cruces will receive $61.8 million from DOT’s  FY25-26 Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant Award  for the Mesa Grande Drive Extension Project.  The project will construct a north-south principal arterial road that will provide a new connection between US Route 70 to Interstate Highways 25 and 10. The project includes new east-west connections at Northrise Drive, Calle Jitas Boulevard, Sedona Hills Parkway, Sonora Springs Boulevard, Sonoma Springs Avenue, and Lohman Avenue. The roadway includes a four-lane boulevard, sidewalks, protected bike lanes, high frequency transit accommodations. 

The New Mexico Department of Transportation will receive $44.  8 million from the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration  Railroad Crossing Elimination Grant Program  for the Allison Road Grade Separated Crossing Project.  The project was selected for Construction and includes activities to support grade crossing and bridge-related improvements on BNSF infrastructure and on Amtrak's Southwest Chief route in Gallup, New Mexico. The grade separated crossing would carry vehicular and non-motorized traffic and connect a newly aligned Allison Road north of the rail corridor with Florence Street (approximately 100 yards west of the existing at-grade Allison Road crossing) south of the corridor. The project aligns with selection criteria by enhancing safety and improving mobility as the project will enhance efficiency of mobility for all users, including transit users and operators, first responders, pedestrians, and cyclists. BNSF, the New Mexico Department of Transportation, and the City of Gallup will contribute the 20 percent non-Federal match. This project qualifies for the statutory set-aside for projects in Rural Areas, and specifically for projects in counties with 20 or fewer residents per square mile. 

The New Mexico Department of Transportation will receive $36.1 million from DOT’s  FY25-26 Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant Awards  for  the Improving Safety and Economic Strength in New Mexico’s Energy Production Basin project.  The project includes reconstruction of two segments on the NM 128 mainline and three major intersections at WIPP Road, Buck Jackson, and Orla Roads. Reconstruction of all intersections includes the addition of left-turn and right-turn lanes and deceleration and acceleration lanes for traffic entering and exiting the highway. “High-T” intersection configurations will also be constructed at each intersection to separate turning traffic from through traffic. Improvements to NM 128 include widening the existing two-lane highway to a four-lane section with a 60-foot depressed median, including ten-foot outside shoulders, and six-foot inside shoulders. 

The Rio Metro Regional Transit District will receive $22.4 million from DOT’s  FY 2025 RAISE Grant Awards  for the New Mexico Rail Runner Express Operations and Maintenance Facility project  .  This project will construct a new Rail Runner Express Operations and Maintenance Facility for the purpose of inspecting and servicing commuter rail locomotives, coach cars, and cab cars. The new facility will feature a maintenance shop that is composed of a high-bay area, storage and work rooms, and offices. 

McKinley County will receive $3.3 million from the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration  Railroad Crossing Elimination Grant Program  for McKinley County-BNSF Rail Crossing Elimination Project.  The project was selected for Project Planning and includes activities to evaluate the potential grade separation of 10 existing at-grade crossings in McKinley and Cibola counites, New Mexico. This project will conduct planning, alternatives analysis, and conceptual pre-engineering. The project aligns with the selection criteria by enhancing safety as the project will reduce or eliminate vehicle and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. McKinley County and the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration will contribute the 20 percent non-Federal match. This project qualifies for the statutory set-aside for Planning projects and the statutory set-aside for projects in Rural Areas, and specifically for projects in counties with 20 or fewer residents per square mile. 

The City of Gallup will receive $2 million from DOT’s  FY24 Reconnecting Communities Pilot Grant Award  for the  City of Gallup 2nd & 3rd Street Crossings Community Planning Project.  The 2nd & 3rd Street Crossing study would identify preferred alternatives to remove two at-grade crossings of a BNSF rail line in downtown Gallup in order to restore community connectivity and reconnect two regions of the City that have historically been bisected by the rail corridor and interstate highway transportation infrastructure. An Alternatives Analysis will determine the preliminary range of reasonable alternatives necessary to carry the Project forward into future development phases. 

The City of Clovis will receive $1 million dollars  from the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration  Railroad Crossing Elimination Grant Program  for the Clovis, New Mexico Corridor Improvement Project.  The project was selected for Project Development and includes activities to eliminate an existing grade crossing and make improvements to another near the BNSF Clovis Yard in Clovis, New Mexico. The project aligns with the selection criteria by enhancing safety, as the project will result in one or more grade crossing improvements, create a new overcrossing of the BNSF line, improve an existing crossing on the east side of the rail yard, and better integrate rail crossing signals into the surrounding network. The City of Clovis and BNSF will contribute the 20 percent non-Federal match. This project qualifies for the statutory set-aside for projects in Rural Areas. 

The Mescalero Apache Tribe will receive $480,913 from the DOT’s  FY24 Tribal Transit Program  for a snowplow and salt spreader to ensure safe transit service in the winter months.  The Mescalero Apache Tribe will receive funding to buy a snowplow-enabled maintenance vehicle to ensure continued transit services in the winter months. The project will ensure continued transit service for tribal members with improved access to jobs, healthcare, and essential services. 

The Pueblo of Taos will receive $158,448  from the DOT’s  FY24 Tribal Transit Program  for capital improvements to two bus stops in Taos Pueblo.  The Pueblo of Taos will receive funding to upgrade two bus stops to American with Disabilities Act standards, which will include shelters, lighting, and other amenities. This project will help the Pueblo of Taos continue to provide safe and reliable transit service to help tribal residents access employment, education, and healthcare.

10:35:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, along with all eight Democrats on the Committee and one Independent, penned a letter to Chairman Mike Lee (R-U.T.) requesting he postpone the Committee’s hearing on the nomination of Governor Doug Burgum to be the Secretary of the Interior for at least one week. 

“  It is now less than 24 hours before the Committee’s hearing on the nomination of Governor Doug Burgum to be the Secretary of the Interior. The Committee still has not received the standard financial disclosure report, ethics agreement, or the opinions from the designated agency ethics officer and the Office of Government Ethics stating that the nominee is in compliance with the ethics laws, which are required by law of all nominees for positions that require Senate confirmation,”  the lawmakers wrote. 

“In view of the fact that the Committee still does not have these documents, which are essential for us to faithfully discharge our constitutional advice-and-consent responsibilities, we respectfully request that you postpone the scheduled hearing on Governor Burgum’s nomination for at least a week to give Members sufficient time to receive and review these materials,”  the lawmakers concluded. 

Penned by Heinrich, the letter was signed by all eight Committee Democrats and one Independent: U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai’i), Angus King (I-Maine), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). 

The letter comes after  numerous attempts  by Heinrich to ensure the Committee has sufficient time to review documents submitted by Burgum required by law and in adherence to Committee rules, including a completed FBI background check and financial report. 

Find the letter  HERE  and below. 

Dear Mr. Chairman: 

It is now less than 24 hours before the Committee’s hearing on the nomination of

In view of the fact that the Committee still does not have these documents, which are

10:37:38 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:37:38 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has  granted  West Virginia the authority to oversee and administer the Class VI well program in the state, which is more commonly known as Class VI “primacy.” These wells are designed to inject carbon dioxide (CO2) into deep rock formations and serve as critical infrastructure for deploying carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. 

“I’m thrilled that, finally, the EPA has now granted West Virginia the authority we need to properly implement carbon capture technology through Class VI well primacy. I have frequently said that the states are better suited than Washington to carry out this authority and get these projects up and running. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage is essential to protecting our ability to provide reliable, baseload power in West Virginia through coal and natural gas, while reducing our power and manufacturing sector emissions. Those on the ground, who understand their states best, are far better positioned to make these decisions, and it’s past time that West Virginia finally has this ability,”  Chairman Capito said  . 

BACKGROUND: 

Senator Capito has continuously advocated for West Virginia to be granted Class VI well primacy. In  May 2023  , Senator Capito introduced legislation to streamline state primacy applications for Class VI wells. In  November 2023  , Senator Capito  urged the EPA  to more quickly grant state primacy for Class VI storage wells and disburse funding from the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  , which she fought to include for future CCUS projects in the state.  Last November  , Senator Capito applauded EPA’s proposal to grant West Virginia this authority, and sent a  letter in support  of approval to the Agency in December.

During the hearing, Chairman Capito asked Zeldin about his priorities regarding energy reliability concerns, addressing PFAS contaminants, and returning EPA back to the responsibility of protecting communities from air, water, and chemical pollution. Additionally, Chairman Capito asked Zeldin about his vision to lead the Agency on matters such as permitting reform, and class VI wells primacy for carbon capture projects. 

HIGHLIGHTS: 

IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY RELIABILITY: 

CHAIRMAN CAPITO: 

“Our nation's electric reliability experts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, has over half of the United States could face potential electrical shortages and blackouts in the next decade. This is a dire situation on the reliability. This demand is driven by our onshoring of our manufacturing and powering data centers and other things to win the artificial intelligence race. Congressman Zeldin, as you oversee and implement the EPA’s statutory obligations to protect public health and the environment, will you also ensure the Agency takes into account the electric reliability and energy affordability impacts on businesses and American families that need it to keep the lights on and heat their homes?” 

LEE ZELDIN: 

“Yes, absolutely.” 

RETURNING TO EPA’S CORE MISSION: 

CHAIRMAN CAPITO: 

“What is your vision for fulfilling the EPA’s statutory mission, particularly in the context of getting the Agency reoriented back to the basics of protecting communities from air, water, and chemical pollution and cleaning up contaminated sites? What ideas do you have moving forward?” 

LEE ZELDIN: 

“Chairman, it's important that the EPA is honoring our obligations under the law, fulfilling the historic landmark laws are on the books, like the  Clean Air Act  , the  Clean Water Act  , the  Safe Drinking Water Act  . It's important that the EPA is accountable and transparent to all of you here on this committee.” 

ADDRESSING PFAS CONTAMINANTS: 

CHAIRMAN CAPITO: 

“I understand that your New York district has actually experienced the negative effects of PFAS pollution. If confirmed, how do you plan to address the growing challenge of PFAS pollution through the EPA’s existing authorities?” 

LEE ZELDIN: 

“That is something that through our enforcement and compliance, we have to ensure that we are moving the needle all across this entire country. There are cleanup projects large and small across America, where many Americans have been waiting decades, generations, for that leadership and that action. So working with all of you to deal with these issues in your home state is something that will be top priority of mine.” 

PERMITTING REFORM: 

CHAIRMAN CAPITO: 

“We need to make it easier to build in America. I believe that's President Trump's vision as well, by modernizing and streamlining our environmental review and permitting processes. Congressman Zeldin, what opportunities do you see for the EPA to be able to establish more efficient and predictable permitting processes, in addition to working with all other agencies that play a part on these vital decisions?” 

LEE ZELDIN: 

“Chairman Capito, that last part of your question is key, for different agencies to be able to work with each other, collaborating with each other, and also for agencies to be able to collaborate with Congress on any opportunities that Congress sees to pursue permitting reform as well. As far as EPA jurisdiction goes, we see a role of the EPA, for example, as it relates to environmental impact statements. There are different issues where there will be opportunities for the EPA to follow its obligations under the law. There's a possibility that Congress might choose to make changes to the law on items that are under EPA jurisdiction. I would look forward to doing my part to make sure the EPA is not holding up any opportunities to be able to pursue sound applications that otherwise would be and should be approved.”

10:37:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a leader on the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced significant broadband investment funding for projects in Hampshire, Hardy, and Nicholas counties. These grants, which were secured through U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Development ReConnect program, will support two high-speed broadband infrastructure projects that will create or improve rural broadband for thousands of people. 

“Through my role on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was able to help craft the ReConnect program because I knew how critical closing the digital divide was to inspire economic growth in rural West Virginia and rural America. Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve supported ReConnect because it specifically addresses the unique difficulties that accompany broadband deployment in rural areas and is specifically equipped to tackle those issues head-on. This announcement will help connect West Virginians to reliable service, and I was proud to partner with the USDA to get it done. This is another step in my goal of connecting every last West Virginian home, school, and business. I look forward to seeing these projects completed,”  Senator Capito said  . 

Individual grant details are below: 

  * $12,435,000 USDA Rural Development ReConnect grant to the Nicholas County Commission (Summersville, W.Va.)  to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet. This network will benefit more than 6,000 people, over 100 businesses, over 100 farms, and multiple educational facilities in Nicholas County in West Virginia. 


  * $5,523,659 USDA Rural Development ReConnect grant to Hardy Telecommunications, Inc. (Lost River, W.Va.)  to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet. This network will benefit more than 1,400 people, dozens of businesses, and a number of farms in Hampshire and Hardy counties in West Virginia. 



BACKGROUND: 

Senator Capito helped create the ReConnect program in 2018, and she also has worked to secure funds for it in every subsequent appropriations bill. Through her  Capito Connect initiative  , Senator Capito has made improving connectivity and closing the digital divide in West Virginia a top priority and has worked to advance efforts and deliver resources to support programs like ReConnect. 

In March 2018, Congress provided $600 million to USDA to expand broadband infrastructure and services in rural America. In December 2018, Agriculture Secretary Perdue announced the rules of the ReConnect program, including how the loans and grants will be awarded to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America. USDA received 146 applications between May 31, 2019, and July 12, 2019, requesting $1.4 billion in funding across all three ReConnect Program funding products: 100 percent loan, 100 percent grant, and loan-grant combinations. USDA is reviewing applications and announcing approved projects on a rolling basis. 

These grants, loans and combination funds enable the federal government to partner with the private sector and rural communities to build modern broadband infrastructure in areas with insufficient internet service. Insufficient service is defined as connection speeds of less than 10 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 1 Mbps upload. 

The ReConnect Program also received $2 billion in the  Infrastructure Investment and Job Act  , which Senator Capito helped craft. 

In October of last year,  Senator Capito spoke at the West Virginia Broadband Summit  about her efforts to expand rural broadband in West Virginia. 

In August,  Senator Capito attended the dedication ceremony  of a successful USDA ReConnect broadband project in Wetzel County. 

In May, Senator Capito announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) had approved  $32,235,629 to the West Virginia Department of Economic Development  to provide matching funds for the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, funded through the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA).

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, held a hearing on the Nomination of Lee Zeldin to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

In her opening remarks, Chairman Capito recognized Zeldin’s military and congressional service, and how his experience and vision will move the EPA forward. Chairman Capito also outlined her priority of seeing the EPA return to its core mission of protecting public health and the environment, while also taking account energy reliability and economic development needs. 

Below is the  opening statement  of Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) as delivered. 

“I am excited to welcome all of you to the EPW Committee hearing, the first one of the 119th Congress and my first as the Chairman. This is also the first hearing with Senator Whitehouse as the Ranking Member. 

“Like me, Ranking Member Whitehouse has served on the EPW Committee since he came to the Senate. He is a passionate and vocal advocate on behalf of Rhode Island, of his constituents, and he is a great partner here on this Committee in delivering legislative solutions for the American public. 

“I am proud of our previous efforts that we’ve worked together to move bipartisan legislation forward, such as laws to support carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technology, as well as the  ADVANCE Act  , which we passed and worked together on for several years, finally got it over the finish line last year, and it was signed into law in working to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

“My partnership with Ranking Member Whitehouse on these issues reflects the broader tradition of the EPW Committee. Quite honestly, we have some tough issues sometimes in here where we have strong disagreement, but we always want to find common ground. 

“This Committee has a strong legacy of working together to pass bipartisan legislation to improve our nation’s infrastructure, invest in water systems, and help clean up our environment. 

“I look forward to continuing this strong bipartisan tradition as the Chairman of the Committee, working with the Ranking Member and all of our members to address critical issues within our jurisdiction of this Congress. 

“This morning, we will hear from President Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, former Congressman Lee Zeldin. Welcome. 

“Congressman Zeldin has served our nation honorably in the U.S. Army, first on active duty and then in the Army Reserve. In 2014, Congressman Zeldin was elected to the House of Representatives – where he served the state of New York for eight years. 

“Throughout his tenure in the House of Representatives, Congressman Zeldin championed critical environmental policies that helped his Long Island district. He supported legislation to boost innovation for clean energy technologies and policies that strengthened our nation’s energy security. 

“I enjoyed meeting with Congressman Zeldin to hear about his experience and his vision for how he would prioritize the Agency’s work as the EPA Administrator. 

“I believe the EPA must return to its core missions. 

“The EPA also should better manage taxpayers’ dollars by doing more with the vast funding that Congress provides. That means reducing, of course, bureaucratic red tape so the state agencies responsible for protecting our nation’s air, land, and water can do so without Washington, D.C. getting into the way. 

“Doing so will lead to those state agencies efficiently improving our drinking water systems and issuing relevant air, land, and water permits. It also means prioritizing the EPA’s attention towards issues that will help Americans in their daily lives. 

“When the EPA focuses on what it does best, it doesn’t just benefit the environment, it benefits our economic growth. 

“For example, the Agency should prioritize cleaning up brownfields and Superfund sites to facilitate new economic development of those locations, many of which are located in rural and distressed areas. 

“I look forward to hearing Congressman Zeldin’s plans to build on the work initiated by the first Trump Administration, including the EPA, which took the first step to address legacy PFAS contamination. 

“And, as the Agency fulfills its obligations under our nation’s bedrock environmental laws, the Administrator should also take into account affordability and electric reliability. 

“Recently, the organization responsible for ensuring grid reliability found that more than half of the United States could experience rolling blackouts in the next decade because of the lack of reliable power capacity. Areas at risk of shortages include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, California, the Midwest, and the Great Plains. 

“The reliability risk is due to the projected retirement of dispatchable power plants, compiled with a 15 percent increase in electricity demand over the next decade. Critically, this demand cannot be met solely with intermittent energy generation. 

“Spiking energy costs and rolling blackouts are an unacceptable fact if the U.S. is to continue as a global leader. 

“Actions that policymakers, and regulators, take now will determine whether America will thrive in an era with a cleaner environment, energy abundance, lower costs, and economic prosperity or face it with a path of scarcity, inflation, and stagnation. 

“I support that first option I named, and believe our nominee does as well. 

“I have confidence that the EPA, under Congressman Zeldin’s leadership, will focus on the EPA’s core mission to protect human health and the environment, while acknowledging the critical role the Agency plays in our economy and international leadership. 

“In doing so, the EPA can make great progress in addressing key environmental challenges consistent with the authorities the Congress has given the Agency. I look forward to discussing these issues with Congressman Zeldin today. 

“I now recognize our Ranking Member Whitehouse for his opening statement.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation (Commerce) Committee, today  questioned former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy  , President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), during his  confirmation hearing  in front of the full Commerce Committee. 

During her questions, Senator Capito asked Mr. Duffy for assurances on efficiently delivering provisions critical to West Virginia of the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  (IIJA)  , increasing safety measures for workers on roads, streamlining permitting processes, and implementing lessons learned from the 2023 train derailment disaster in East Palestine, Ohio. 

HIGHLIGHTS  : 

ON IMPROVING IMPLEMENTATION EFFICIENCY OF THE IIJA: 

SEN. CAPITO:  “The rules and regulations, you know, we’re over three years past [the IIJA’s] signing, and it is my hope that you would commit to reviewing and updating as necessary what this Biden administration, they really dragged their heels on this thing, the benefit-cost analysis guidance that they have put forward and make sure that we are looking at the vital role that bridges and roads play in connecting rural areas like mine and states like yours.” 

MR. DUFFY:  “Yes, absolutely, Senator.” 

ON IMPROVING PERMITTING PROCESSES UNDER THE “ONE FEDERAL DECISION” POLICY: 

SEN. CAPITO:  “One of the other things in the [IIJA] is a thing called ‘One Federal Decision.’ It was supposed to help with ease of permitting. It was supposed to put one particular agency in charge, and maybe the [Army Corps of Engineers], Fish and Wildlife, and others would go up to the Federal Highway Administration. I can't get an accurate reading as to whether this is working or not. I can't get an accurate reading of whether these other agencies are abiding by this. It makes good, common sense. We've all talked about project delivery and how things can go quicker. I don't know how familiar you are with the One Federal Decision process. Are you familiar with it, and will you please take a look at it to make sure the desires that we had initially are actually being met in the end?” 

MR. DUFFY:  “Should I be confirmed, I'll become more familiar with it, and I think it makes a lot of sense, and I think it goes to the point of bipartisanship in this- in this committee, but also in the body as a whole, of figuring out how we can streamline this process and, again, be responsible, but also move projects. So, I would work with you on that, and I'll report back on what I find.” 

SEN. CAPITO:  “You know, the model for that has been used in some energy projects and hoping that what we've done in transportation can translate into other project development. Permitting goes into this as well, but it just hasn't met the expectation. So, we need to work on that.” 

ON IMPROVING RAIL SAFETY AFTER THE EAST PALESTINE DISASTER: 

SEN. CAPITO:  “I would say that the rail safety, the East Palestine accident occurred seven miles from West Virginia. A lot of the emergency responders who responded to that were volunteer firefighters from my state. Obviously, everybody's going to- I mean, we, everybody pitched in to help there. But I do think there are things that we can work, working with the industry, working with others, the union, and everybody to make sure that our rails are as safe as they possibly can be as they move the goods and the people throughout the country. So, I want to work with you on that as well.” 

MR. DUFFY:  “I would welcome that, and also just, I mean, even knowing what hazardous materials are on trains, communities knowing so they can prepare, should there be an accident, I think would go a long way to making sure we don't have the scenario that we had in East Palestine.” 

SEN. CAPITO:  “Right, I think one of the aftermaths of that has been some training- additional training so that this, you know, they know the materials, they know what the best way to handle it is. So, we have made strides there we just need to continue that.” 

ON IMPROVING ROAD SAFETY, ESPECIALLY FOR HIGHWAY WORKERS: 

SEN. CAPITO:  “When somebody is working on the highways, we've had some tragic accidents where people just blowing into workers, killing them in some instances. Maryland had a terrible accident. I think this is- we need to look at best practices here to see where we can make drivers more aware when they enter a work zone, they're really entering a work zone where people are putting their lives the danger. So, I would encourage you, I don't know if you have any thoughts on that in terms of keeping our highway workers or construction workers safe while they're out there sometimes in the middle of the night?” 

MR. DUFFY:  “I think that's a really important point. I'll look at the data, and I'd love to partner with you to figure out what we can do to make sure that those who, again, are just doing the work of building great roads in America aren't losing their lives because of inattentive or reckless drivers.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor highlighting the importance of honoring the legacy of Laken Riley by securing our Southern Border and bringing criminal illegal immigrants to justice. 

Senator Capito’s floor remarks, as prepared for delivery, are included below: 

“Mr/Madam President, 

“This week, the Senate is proud to take another step toward securing our Southern Border  as we consider the  Laken Riley Act  . 

“I want to extend my deep gratitude to Senator Katie Britt and Senator Ted Budd for their leadership in bringing this bill forward. 

“First and foremost, I want to say that I strongly support this measure. 

“With this bill, the Senate takes a bold stand for the safety and prosperity of American citizens after four years of mismanagement, decline, and ultimately, chaos. 

“The  Laken Riley Act  is the answer to a loud and clear call made at the ballot box by the American people: to unite as a country, to put Americans First, and to address the tragic lawlessness at our Southern Border. 

“And so, as the Senate’s first order of legislative business, we are answering that call. 

“The radical open border policies of the Left have caused untold suffering for families across the nation, families like the Riley family, who are still grieving the unimaginable loss of their daughter, Laken. 

“Laken Riley was just 22 years old, a young nursing student with a promising future ahead of her. 

“Tragically, she was stolen from this earth by an individual who should never have been allowed to roam free. 

“Laken should be alive today, and she would be, if her killer had been brought to justice before it was too late. 

“In Laken, we lost a bright, beautiful soul, as those who knew her will attest. 

“The law should serve our citizens, yet it was somehow Laken’s killer that benefited from our system. 

“It’s time we honor Laken’s legacy by putting American citizens first. 

“The  Laken Riley Act  , while too late to prevent Laken’s tragedy, is a targeted bill that will save countless others. 

“It will ensure other illegal immigrants, not dissimilar to her killer, are detained for their crimes before they get a chance to commit a more serious offense. 

“Anyone who has entered the U.S. illegally and then committed a crime should and will face detention and deportation. 

“Laken’s killer was arrested three times and released three times: once at the border, again in New York, and a third time in Athens mere weeks before he took Laken’s life. 

“That won’t happen under the  Laken Riley Act  . 

“This is a problem that cannot be ignored. The American people demand change. 

“The American people want us to fix the system that failed to uphold the law and keep Laken safe. 

“Her cause is their cause. 

“It’s the cause of every mother, every father, every brother, and every sister of a young girl who simply wants to go on a run in her own neighborhood and feel safe. 

“I know, at its core, this is a truly bipartisan issue. 

“We all want to keep our communities safe, Republicans and Democrats. 

“Our Republican Conference is completely unified behind the  Laken Riley Act  , and we’ve managed to win over a majority of Senate Democrats for the bill’s initial consideration, including two who have signed on as cosponsors. 

“As my Democratic colleague from Pennsylvania has noted, failure to pass this bill would represent everything wrong with Congress. 

“The truth is that American citizens have had enough of talk, especially after these last four years. 

“Now is the time for action. 

“This week we will have before us a tranche of critical votes that America will be intently watching. 

“To the families watching who have lost loved ones, like the Riley family, we stand with you. 

“We feel your grief and your pain, and we will guard against this heartbreak happening ever again. 

“Now more than ever, it is incumbent upon my colleagues and me to support America’s families and pass the strongest possible bill for our communities. 

“With that, I look forward to advancing the  Laken Riley Act  this week. 

“Thank you, and I yield the floor.”

10:37:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Co-Chair of the National Service Congressional Caucus, celebrated the inclusion of a key provision from his Promoting Service Through AmeriCorps (PSA) Act in President Biden’s latest round of executive orders. This action will make it easier for AmeriCorps alumni to use the skills they’ve learned during their service and find fulfilling careers with federal agencies. 

“AmeriCorps members of every background and generation are driven to give back to their communities through service, and it’s no surprise that they’d continue to be drawn toward serving the public good when their terms end,”  said Senator Coons  . “President Biden’s recent executive order builds on my legislation and will allow AmeriCorps alumni to jump-start their federal careers. This is one of many commonsense improvements to national service I proposed with Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in our bipartisan legislation to expand and reauthorize AmeriCorps. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to build on this momentum to deliver for the more than 200,000 Americans serving their communities through AmeriCorps each year.” 

This week, the White House announced that President Biden had signed an executive order allowing agencies to more quickly hire individuals who have completed a full-time AmeriCorps program, a provision included in broader legislation that Senators Coons and Cassidy introduced in September 2024 that would  reauthorize and strengthen AmeriCorps programs  . Under the executive order, AmeriCorps members who complete 1,700 or more hours of AmeriCorps service will receive federal noncompetitive eligibility for one year after their service, allowing members to be hired by federal agencies through a more streamlined process. 

Noncompetitive eligibility is already available to veterans and military spouses, Foreign Service spouses, select current and former federal employees, Peace Corps alumni, and alumni of AmeriCorps VISTA. President Biden’s executive order does not give AmeriCorps members priority status over other candidates, in contrast to the hiring preference that veterans and military spouses receive.

10:37:47 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:37:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and U.S. Representatives Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Judy Chu (D-Calif.), and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) led over 130 members of Congress this week in writing to Treasury Secretary-Designate Scott Bessent and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner-Designate Billy Long, urging them to keep and expand the IRS Direct File program. 

In 2024, in red and blue states, Direct File, a new tool for taxpayers to file their taxes online for free with the IRS, helped thousands of taxpayers file accurately and securely. The program received excellent reviews and is set to expand this month to 25 states and over 30 million eligible Americans. Direct File was created as part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 

“This program is efficient and effective, providing a vital service for millions of Americans, while also keeping their data safe from misuse,”  the lawmakers wrote.  “Congress does not need to pass legislation to continue this progress. If confirmed, we urge you to maintain and expand it.” 

Direct File was created to save taxpayers time and money. Right now, on average, Americans spend $160 and eight hours to file their taxes, often losing a chunk of their refund to do so. Giving taxpayers the option to file for free through the Direct File program has saved filers approximately $5.6 million in federal tax preparation fees in just its pilot year and is projected to save filers $11 billion a year at scale. 

The 2024 Direct File pilot proved to be a success. Used by more than 140,000 taxpayers, nearly 90% of surveyed filers said Direct File increased their trust in the IRS, and nearly 90% had “above average” or “excellent” experiences with the program. Indeed, the pilot was so successful that, when the IRS announced it would make Direct File a permanent program, 13 additional states elected to offer this option to their taxpayers. 

“Taxpayers’ embrace of Direct File is indicative of their interest in a free, easy, private, and secure method of filing,”  the lawmakers continued  . “We disagree with our colleagues who are calling on the President to pull the plug, harming taxpayers and undermining the work that two dozen state governments in red and blue states have done to support taxpayers for the upcoming 2025 tax filing season.” 

Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the leaders of President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, have talked about developing a mobile app for Americans to file their taxes for free with the IRS. The lawmakers believe that Direct File is a current solution that aligns with their goal. 

While Delaware is not part of the program yet, the IRS doubled the number of states using Direct File for 2025: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 

The letter is signed by 26 senators and 115 House members.

“I welcome this decision to uphold a bipartisan national security bill passed by Congress last spring. TikTok is not just another social media platform; it is a means by which the Chinese Communist Party collects data on millions of Americans and directly influences their political views and conduct. We must take commonsense measures to protect our democracy and national security from those who wish to do us harm. That is precisely what Congress did here and what the Supreme Court has today unanimously endorsed. 

“I understand that many Americans will be disappointed to lose access to TikTok. ByteDance – TikTok’s Chinese parent company – had nine months to divest TikTok and sell the social media platform to a company unaffiliated with a foreign adversary. That opportunity still exists. It is not too late for ByteDance to allow Americans to maintain access to the app by selling TikTok.”

10:37:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) questioned President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.),  at his confirmation hearing today  before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he pushed Rubio on his plans to sustain U.S. global leadership, including multilateral engagement, and his approach to working with presidential Special Envoys. 

At today’s hearing, Senator Coons spoke positively about his tenure serving with Rubio in the Senate and asked questions regarding Rubio’s vision as Secretary of State. Senator Coons underscored the importance of Rubio continuing U.S. leadership in multilateral organizations as a pillar of global engagement and national security. He also expressed concerns related to the last Trump administration’s withdrawal from the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Human Rights Council, and the World Health Organization, noting how such extreme moves provided opportunities for U.S. adversaries to advance their competing agendas in those forums. 

Senator Coons also questioned Rubio on President-elect Trump’s early appointment of multiple Special Envoys, who have been tasked with handling several diplomatic hotspots around the world. Specifically, Senator Coons asked Rubio how the administration plans to make the vetting and appointment of Special Envoys transparent and ensure they do not detract from the State Department’s traditional jurisdiction. 

A video and partial transcript of Senator Coons’ comments are available below. 

WATCH HERE  . 

Senator Coons:  President-elect Trump has appointed a series of Special Envoys focused on a wide range of areas, and some of these, I think, can genuinely complement – not undermine or distract from – State Department’s core efforts. The Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, for example – Adam Boehler – I look forward to working with. Senator [Dave] McCormick [R-Pa.] asked about – there’s a number of key issues around hostage-taking of Americans. There’s a bipartisan bill Senator [Jim] Risch [R-Idaho] and I have on this that we hope to work with you on. Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, I think will be central to achieving an outcome in Ukraine that is a lasting and secure peace and prevents further Russian aggression. But others,like Rick Grenell [as Special Envoy] for Special Missions and Massad Boulos [as Senior Advisor] for the Arab world, concern me in terms of the potential for mission conflict or conflict of interest. How will you work to ensure that State maintains its authority and encourage the administration to conduct a full vetting of any potential conflicts of interest and to ensure there’s clarity of alignment with Special Envoys? 

Senator Rubio  : Sure, and thank you for the question, because I think it’s a valid one. With the exception of Mr. Boulos, who I don’t know – may have met once, but don’t know – every one of the envoys that have been named so far [is] someone that I’ve worked with in the past and expect to work well with in the future. To me, the expression of a Special Envoy is critically important; where it’s most successful, it sits on a complex issue with a defined goal and an expression of presidential priorities. So, Sudan is an example of a Special Envoy, and Mr. [Tom] Perriello and the job he’s done there. And this is in addition to the fact that we have an Ambassador and we have other presence, diplomatic presence there, that can be very complimentary. So, the way this will work, and how I anticipate it will work is, these envoys work for the President in coordination with us. … 

Senator Coons:  [M]ultilateral organizations concern and frustrate many of us; some of their actions have been counter to American interests, but when we’ve withdrawn from multilateral organizations, and in particular, some U.N. entities, it’s also given an opening to our adversaries. The previous Trump administration withdrew from UNESCO, the Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, and I’m concerned that if we do so without thinking through the consequences, we may abandon our chance to implement our agenda around human rights, around 5G standards, around technical standards that matter for the 21st century. Do you support sustained U.S. participation in multilateral organizations, and how will you work to strengthen our leadership in those institutions in ways that prevent our adversaries from advancing their competing agendas? 

Senator Rubio:  Well, I want to point back to what I said at the opening, and that is, our engagement in any international agreement or any international arrangement or any international organization has to be driven by the answer to one of three questions: Will our involvement in this organization make us safer, make us more prosperous, make us more secure? It has to be justified by an American interest; it just does. I mean, we’re in an era where we need to really – it should have always been that way – but now more than ever, and so each of these will have different components to it. I think there’s a second component of funding, and that is, should the United States be funding organizations who, in many cases, are pursuing and or achieving outcomes that are contrary to the national interest of the United States? Each of these will require a serious examination as we work through and a justification to Congress about why we’re no longer funding it or we’re no longer participating. … 

Senator Coons:  In closing, I’ll just repeat something I’ve heard from several of my colleagues. I think that our global network of alliances and partners, rooted in our shared values – a commitment to democracy and human rights – is essential to our national security and how the war in Ukraine ends, and whether a peace agreement there lasts and secures Ukraine from ongoing Russian aggression, is critical to our credibility and security and to sustaining that network of allies and partners. I hope that’s something you strongly agree with.

10:37:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) today  introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act  that would strike a section that weakens the federal government’s authority over our immigration laws. 

Senator Coons’ amendment would have addressed concerns about our immigration system and public safety raised by both Democrats and Republicans regarding Section 3 of the Laken Riley Act. Section 3 would weaken long-established due processes and take oversight away from the federal government. It would also allow state attorneys general to sue the federal government over individual decisions made by agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 

“I respect that colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed their intention to vote for the Laken Riley bill and to advance it,”  said Senator Coons  . “I have not yet made any such commitment out of concern about the unintended consequences of several provisions of this bill. … [W]e should not have the division and frankly, ultimately, the chaos, in the enforcement of our immigration laws that would likely result from having a raft of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general in courts all over the country, testing and challenging almost literally every detention decision. I believe it is possible for this act to be improved, for it to advance public safety, and for it to make a contribution to the country, and it is my hope that the amendments being offered will be taken up and passed.” 

By a vote of 46-49, the Senate did not adopt Senator Coons’ amendment. 

A video and partial transcript of Senator Coons’ comments are available below. 

WATCH HERE. 

Senator Coons:  Amidst real resource constraints, unpredictable migration patterns, and fluctuating diplomatic sensitivities, our federal law enforcement officers at ICE and CBP make thousands of complex decisions day-in and day-out about how to deal with interior enforcement, with border encounters, who to detain, and who to release. And it’s because these decisions involve so many complex factors that the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized [that] the federal government is and should be the ultimate authority on enforcement of our immigration laws. Section 3, however, would mark a sea change by inviting every state attorney general to sue whenever they disagree with even an individual-level federal decision regarding detention and removal. This could create uncertainty or even chaos by encouraging conflicting lawsuits brought in different states in different courts. 

Senator Coons:  I will remind my colleagues: This provision may have been drafted when the view was that Republican state attorneys general would sue a Democratic administration to move closer towards the enforcement vision that they prioritize. Roughly half of the state attorneys general belong to each political party. I hope that my colleagues who have reflected upon the consequences of this provision will conclude that we should not have the division and frankly, ultimately, the chaos, in the enforcement of our immigration laws that would likely result from having a raft of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general in courts all over the country, testing and challenging almost literally every detention decision. I believe it is possible for this act to be improved, for it to advance public safety, and for it to make a contribution to the country, and it is my hope that the amendments being offered will be taken up and passed.

Under questioning from Senator Coons, Bondi also confirmed that President-elect Trump would not be able to run for another term in 2028 unless the Constitution was amended to allow him to do so. 

Senator Coons joined his colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee for Bondi’s confirmation hearing, where senators examined Bondi’s qualifications and experience in her bid to lead the nation’s highest law enforcement agency. He questioned Bondi about whether she would let her loyalty to Trump interfere with the DOJ’s core mission; Trump has repeatedly asked the department to investigate individuals he believes are his political opponents, and Kash Patel, Trump’s nominee to lead the FBI – who would serve under Bondi – has a published “enemies list” of Democrats and “disloyal” Republicans whom he has made clear he plans to go after when confirmed. 

A video and partial transcript of Senator Coons’ comments are available below. 

WATCH HERE  . 

Senator Coons:  A simple question of constitutional interpretation: Is President-elect Trump eligible to run for another term as President in 2028? 

Bondi:  No, Senator – not unless they change the Constitution. 

Senator Coons:  Thank you. One of the concerns I’ve raised with you is safeguarding the Department of Justice’s independence in the face of some promises on the campaign trail by then-candidate Trump that he would use the department to target his political adversaries or that he might interfere with prosecution. What would you do if your career DOJ prosecutors came to you with a case to prosecute, grounded in the facts and law, but the White House directs you to drop the case? 

Bondi:  Senator, if I thought that would happen, I would not be sitting here today. That will not happen – will not happen. Every case will be prosecuted based on the facts and the law that is applied in good faith, period. Politics have got to be taken out of the system. This department has been weaponized for years and years and years, and it has to stop. 

Senator Coons:  Thank you. Let me, if I might … refer you back to Senator [Dick] Durbin’s [D-Ill.] opening comments about previous attorneys general – our former colleague Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr – I don’t think it’s credible to say that it may never happen that the president-elect would direct an unethical or illegal act. I think both of those attorneys general found themselves crosswise with the then-president by doing things he didn’t welcome or approve of. Just answer the question for me, if you would: I know you may not expect it; I know you wouldn’t have accepted this nomination if you thought it possible – but let’s imagine that once again, President-elect Trump issues a directive or order to you or to the FBI director that is outside the boundaries of ethics or law. What will you do? 

Bondi:  Senator, I will never speak on a hypothetical, especially one saying that the President would do something illegal. What I can tell you is my duty, if confirmed as the Attorney General, will be to the Constitution and the United States of America, and the most important oath, part of that oath, that I will take are the last four words: “So help me God.”

10:38:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  —Today, after Israel’s security cabinet approved a ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas that would free dozens of hostages held in Gaza and temporarily pause the long-running war, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement: 

“I applaud the incredible work of the Biden Administration, as well as our Qatari and Egyptian partners, in securing a hostage release deal, a ceasefire in Gaza, and a surge in the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid. After more than 15 months of fighting, it is my sincere hope that this pause in hostilities is the foundation for a sustainable peace for Israelis and Palestinians. 

“The United States will continue to stand with Israel, and our commitment to Israel’s security will remain ironclad. 

“The United States and the international community must work together to help rebuild Gaza, observe and enforce protection protocols, and put an end to Hamas’ ruinous control over innocent Gazans. Only then can there be a lasting end to these hostilities.”

10:38:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC –  Thanks to a new law that kicked in this month, Rhode Islanders with a Medicare prescription drug plan -- also known as Medicare Part D – are seeing their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs capped at $2,000 each year. And today, the Biden administration announced that  Medicare will negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical companies on 15 more popular drugs  prescribed to treat cancer, diabetes, asthma, and more. These drugs include: Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus, Trelegy Ellipta, Xtandi, Pomalyst, Ibrance, Ofev, Linzess, Calquence, Austedo, Breo/Ellipta, Tradjenta, Xifaxan, Vraylar, Janumet and Otezla. 

U.S. Senator Jack Reed says older Rhode Islanders with costly prescription medication should start to see some real relief at the pharmacy counter thanks to a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act (P.L. 117-169), a 2022 law Reed helped pass that phased in a new spending cap for Medicare beneficiaries. The average American who qualifies could save as much as $1,500 in out-of-pocket drug expenses, according to an analysis from AARP. And over the course of 2025, the Reed-backed law is expected to save about 68,000 Medicare Part D enrollees in Rhode Island a total of over $23 million. 

“One of the biggest expenses for seniors on fixed incomes is prescription drug costs. I helped include provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act to lower the prices seniors pay at the pharmacy counter, making them healthier and more financially secure. The new $2,000 annual out-of-pocket drug price cap will deliver significant savings to thousands of Rhode Island seniors in 2025. This new benefit builds on other important cost-saving aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed into law. I will continue working to lower costs for seniors and prevent the incoming administration from repealing these cost-saving measures and allowing Big Pharma to hike prices on seniors to pad their profits. The cost of life-saving medications should be affordable and transparent,” said Senator Reed. 

Medicare Part D is a voluntary program that helps pay for prescription drugs for people with Medicare. Nationwide, Medicare covers about 66 million people in the U.S., and 50.5 million patients are enrolled in Part D plans. 

Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, some patients had to pay tens of thousands of dollars in prescription drug costs each year. 

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  (ASPE) recently released data  projecting that approximately 11 million enrollees are expected to benefit from the $2,000 cap in 2025, collectively saving $7.2 billion, or about $600 per enrollee. Those without financial assistance could save even more, averaging $1,100 per enrollee. 

Additionally, AARP commissioned a  new report  by consulting firm Avalere that found  “an estimated 94 percent of all Part D enrollees expected to reach the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap in 2025 will have lower total out-of-pocket costs, saving an average of $2,474. This amount represents a 48 percent reduction in their total out-of-pocket costs. The analysis also found that, on average, 62 percent of the enrollees will save more than $1,000 and 12 percent will save more than $5,000.” 

The AARP report suggests the $2,000 price cap could be a huge benefit to Medicare enrollees who struggle to afford high-cost drugs for a variety of serious conditions. These older Americans and other U.S. patients pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations. 

The AARP-commissioned report also noted that millions more Americans are projected to benefit from the cap on out-of-pocket drug costs with each passing year, and significantly increase between 2025 and 2029. 

The Inflation Reduction Act, which was approved by Congress without a single Republican vote, also included other key measures to help lower high prescription drug prices and health-related costs, including a new $35 monthly cap on insulin, access to free preventive vaccines, and empowering Medicare to use its purchasing power to negotiate lower prices directly with drug manufacturers. 

In 2023, the Biden Administration  unveiled the first ten prescription drugs that would have their prices lowered through negotiations by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  . The first round included medications for blood clots, diabetes, arthritis and heart failure — such as Eliquis, Xarelto, Farxiga, Januvia, Stelara and Entresto. U.S. taxpayers saved an estimated $6 billion in the first year from the new, lower prices, which were  negotiated down by as much as 79 percent  . The 15 drugs added to the negotiating list today were used by about 5.3 million Medicare enrollees and cost Medicare about $41 billion, prior to rebates and discounts. Together, these 25 prescription drugs represent about a third of Medicare Part D spending on prescription drugs. 

Drug companies will have until February 28, 2025, to decide on their participation in the negotiations. CMS will then consider various factors, including clinical benefits and the drugs' impact on specific populations, during the negotiation process. 

If the lower negotiated prices go through, they will take effect in 2027. But the Trump Administration has not committed to lowering drug prices for seniors. 

“No one should be driven into debt to pay for their prescription medicines. That’s why I will continue looking out for older Americans and working to bring down costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Trump Administration should continue to build on our hard won progress to lower health costs. If they fail to do so, they will be directly responsible for raising the price of prescription drugs on all Americans,” concluded Senator Reed.

10:38:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: PROVIDENCE, RI –  In an effort to help coordinate housing and supportive services for families and individuals experiencing homelessness across Rhode Island, U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD), today announced $17,339,800 in federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants for Rhode Island homeless assistance programs. 

The federal funds are flowing to Rhode Island as the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to grow. 2,442 Rhode Islanders were identified during the January 2024 “Point in Time Count” survey as lacking stable and adequate housing. This is an increase of about 35 percent compared to 2023. The annual count, which takes place every January, was led by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness. 

The federal homeless assistance funds, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), help local nonprofits and community partners deliver safe, affordable housing and supportive services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. It will also help renew several projects that develop and implement a coordinated approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness through Rhode Island’s Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP). 

“Everyone deserves a safe, healthy, and warm place to call home. We must continue our work to ensure that Rhode Islanders who are experiencing homelessness have easy access to comprehensive, effective services that help to break the cycle of poverty and offer pathways to supportive, stable housing. This federal funding goes a long way toward helping those on the front lines do transformative, life-saving work that helps our most vulnerable neighbors and strengthens our communities. I am proud to support these organizations in delivering both housing and wraparound services that provide individuals, families, youth, and young adults the platform and support they need to thrive,” said Senator Reed. 

The federal CoC grants are coordinated at the state level by RIHousing and administered by non-profits throughout the state. CoC funds are eligible for a variety of homeless assistance activities, including permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, coordinated entry systems, and other services to help ensure homelessness is a brief and rare experience. 

“RIHousing is proud to receive additional funding for our Continuum of Care program alongside non-profit housing and services providers working throughout our state to end homelessness,” said Carol Ventura, CEO & Executive Director of RIHousing. “We thank Senator Reed for his tireless work to bring home these federal resources and look forward to continuing to work with our partners and other stakeholders to assist vulnerable Rhode Islanders.” 

“Senator Reed has long been a champion for those most in need in our community,” said Michelle Wilcox, president and CEO, Crossroads Rhode Island. “With homelessness reaching record levels both in Rhode Island and across the nation, Crossroads Rhode Island is extremely grateful to receive this critical funding, which is needed now more than ever. CoC grants are foundational to our ability to continue to provide safe and affordable housing and supportive services to the more than two thousand people who are experiencing homelessness in our state right now.” 

“We are incredibly grateful to Senator Reed and the entire Rhode Island delegation for their continued advocacy and unwavering support for critical housing initiatives. This federal funding ensures that Sojourner House can continue providing life-saving services and stable housing for individuals and families who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking. At a time when homelessness is on the rise, these resources are essential to helping us break the cycle of abuse and trauma for Rhode Islanders in need,” said Vanessa Volz, President and CEO of Sojourner House. 

“House of Hope affirms that housing is a basic human right. This critical funding affirms that everyone deserves the opportunity to access housing, with the added benefit of high quality supportive services,” said Laura Jaworski, Executive Director of House of Hope. “On behalf of House of Hope CDC, thank you for understanding this essential linkage and supporting us in our efforts to end homelessness in Rhode Island.” 

Senator Reed has been a strong supporter of housing assistance and homelessness prevention initiatives while continually leading efforts in the Senate to increase funding to address the root causes of homelessness. In the fiscal year 2024 (FY23) appropriations bill, Reed secured $4.1 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, an increase of $418 million above FY23. He also delivered $1.3 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program which has helped preserve approximately 1.35 million affordable homes nationwide. 

Reed authored the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, which President Obama signed into law to streamline homeless assistance grant programs and increase homelessness prevention resources, empowering communities to more efficiently and strategically provide housing and services to this vulnerable population.

10:38:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:38:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led SASC Democrats in a hearing to examine Mr. Pete Hegseth’s nomination to be Secretary of Defense. Following the hearing, Senator Reed issued the following statement: 

“I went into today’s hearing with deep concerns about Mr. Hegseth’s qualifications to be Secretary of Defense, and my fears were confirmed. He lacks the requisite character, competence, and commitment to do this job. Indeed, he is the least qualified nominee for Secretary of Defense in modern history. 

“In addition to his own alarming statements, there are simply too many disturbing reports about Mr. Hegseth to ignore. A variety of sources accuse him of disregarding the laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks, alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other troubling issues. 

“If a servicemember had the same record of misconduct, they would be disqualified from holding any leadership position in the military, much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense. 

“Mr. Hegseth dodged and deferred questions about his conduct. He instead focused on complaining and calling our military weak and too “politically correct.” I am concerned that confirming Mr. Hegseth would send a message to our troops that they will be evaluated on political standards rather than merits, and that he will inject politics into a nonpartisan organization. 

“Further, Mr. Hegseth failed to convince us that he is capable of running any organization remotely as complex as the Department of Defense. He financially mismanaged two veterans' organizations and created a workplace culture of misconduct, including several incidents of public intoxication. This is unacceptable behavior for a Secretary of Defense nominee. 

“Further, he defended his recent statement that: “I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles.” 

“Finally, I am disappointed by the investigative process for Mr. Hegseth. The point of a thorough FBI background check is to confirm that there is no derogatory information that would compromise a nominee’s ability to do their job. 

“The FBI process designed by the Trump Transition Team for Mr. Hegseth has been woefully inadequate. Investigators neglected to contact critical witnesses and whistleblowers, and the final report has not been shared with other members of the committee. 

“I was also disappointed that the committee could not have a second round of questioning with Mr. Hegseth. There are important questions that remain unanswered, and I will continue to seek them. 

“Today’s hearing has adjourned, but I believe the jury is still out. I encourage my Republican colleagues to carefully examine the facts.”

10:38:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC –  In an effort to strengthen Rhode Island’s workforce and create more high-paying ocean technology and ‘Blue Economy’ jobs, Rhode Island’s Congressional Delegation today announced $3.8 million to support workforce development in ocean robotics, sensors, and materials industries to meet the demands of ocean-based technology companies and their extensive supply chains within the region. 

U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo today announced that Ocean Tech Works, led by the University of Rhode Island Research Foundation, has been selected to receive a Good Jobs Challenge Grant. 

Funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), this federal job training initiative is designed to support economic development, connect people to good-paying jobs, and help underserved communities leverage regional assets. The program brings together private industry, state and local government, higher education, labor unions, nonprofit institutions, and other critical stakeholders to develop and grow innovative industries that stimulate economic growth and create good-paying jobs. 

The emerging ocean-based economy is a key economic driver for the region and the nation, creating high-quality jobs locally, while simultaneously giving the United States a competitive advantage in a global market and securing our national interests. The Ocean Tech Works project is strategically aligned with the EDA-designated Ocean Tech Hub, centered in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, and will play a pivotal role in connecting new talent pipelines to high-demand jobs in advanced materials and composites, robotics, and advanced manufacturing. 

“The Ocean Tech Works project exemplifies the collaborative spirit of both Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, uniting public, private, and educational institutions to address the workforce needs of the rapidly expanding ocean technology sector. This project will be poised to deliver great results that help more Rhode Islanders access good-paying jobs and contribute to the economic vitality of the region and nation as a whole,” said Reed, Whitehouse, Magaziner and Amo in a joint statement. 

“We are honored to receive the EDA Good Jobs Award, made possible through the support of our federal delegation” said Christian Cowan, Executive Director of Polaris MEP. “Ocean Tech Works is a regional, collaborative workforce development program dedicated to filling immediate opportunities in ocean-based jobs. This initiative is a cornerstone of our region’s expanding Blue Economy ecosystem, and we are excited to implement these programs in partnership with our public and private collaborators.” 

“This is a big win for Team Rhode Island and our neighbors in southeastern Massachusetts, and it underscores the critical importance of the ocean technology sector in our regional and national economy,” said Governor Dan McKee. “These resources will help put more Rhode Islanders on a path to good jobs, higher wages, and long-term career advancement, and I applaud Polaris MEP for their collaborative and strategic effort to move this work forward.” 

"This federal investment is a significant win for the state’s workforce and our growing Blue Economy. By providing Rhode Islanders with access to free, hands-on training in high-demand fields like ocean robotics, advanced manufacturing, and composites, we’re preparing hundreds of workers for well-paying jobs while ensuring our local businesses have the skilled talent they need to thrive," said Matthew Weldon, Director, RI Department of Labor & Training. "We’re proud to collaborate with our partners on this transformative effort and look forward to the lasting impact it will have on our communities and industries across the region." 

With 2024 Good Jobs Challenge funding, Rhode Island’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center, Polaris MEP, will lead the coordination of a robust regional partnership that includes industry leaders such as New Bedford Research & Robotics and the RI Marine Trades Association, Community College of RI and Bristol Community College, UA Local 51 Plumbers & Pipefitters Union, workers’ rights organization Fuerza Laboral, and many others. This coalition will provide 400 individuals with free, accelerated skills training in occupations such as CNC machining, welding, composites, robotics, and remote-operated vehicles – positions for which local employers have indicated strong hiring needs. Additionally, the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training and the Rhode Island Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner will be critically engaged in coordinating and delivering services and wraparound support to participants.

10:38:12 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:38:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: JOHNSTON, RI –  Overlooking the intersection of Atwood Avenue and Hartford Avenue on the steps of Johnston Town Hall, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Representative Seth Magaziner today joined Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. to deliver a $2 million federal earmark that will advance a flood mitigation project at this critical crossroad. 

Persistent and damaging flooding around Johnston Center has impacted residents and commuters for decades. The town is putting $2,080,000 in federal funds to work on a flood mitigation project to strengthen flood related infrastructure in the area and reduce the economic and environmental impacts of significant rainfall events. 

The federal earmark will help to reconfigure existing drainage infrastructure and more efficiently manage the flow of water around this intersection during and after significant rainfall events. 

“This is good news for the residents of Johnston and those who rely on this important intersection to get to school, work, the market, or any of the local stores nearby. The federal earmark I helped secure with Senator Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner will help manage flooding and reduce the impact on local roads, businesses, and homes,”  said Senator Reed  , a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who has long worked with local officials and federal agencies to address flooding in the Pocasset River Watershed. In addition to this federal earmark, Reed has helped direct an additional $12 million in federal funds to bolster flood related infrastructure and assist homeowners throughout the watershed. 

“The delegation has worked hard to make Johnston more resilient and to ensure residents have options for dealing with the frequent, severe flooding that has affected multiple areas of town,”  said Whitehouse  , Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. “We are delivering federal funding to support Mayor Polisena’s effort to help small businesses stay open, minimize storm-related property damage, and keep residents safe on the roads.” 

“Every Rhode Islander deserves to know that their families, homes, and businesses are safe from extreme weather — yet too many Johnston residents know all too well the devastating impacts of flooding to their lives and livelihoods,”  said Rep. Seth Magaziner  . “I’m proud to have partnered with Senators Reed and Whitehouse to deliver federal funding that will help mitigate flooding in Johnston and bring peace of mind to residents.” 

“Today marks a significant step forward for Johnston and our residents. This federal earmark will allow us to address the chronic flooding that has disrupted lives, businesses, and commutes for far too long. Our main intersection, where Hartford and Atwood Avenues meet, often becomes impassable during heavy rains, effectively splitting the town in two and limiting highway access. With this funding, we will implement innovative solutions like bioswales and install new piping under both streets, connecting to our existing detention ponds. While the layout of the area will look the same, its functionality during heavy rains will be vastly improved,”  said  Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr  . “I want to thank Senator Reed, Senator Whitehouse, and Congressman Magaziner for their unwavering support and collaboration in securing these funds. Together, we are making Johnston stronger, more connected, and more resilient for the future.” 

According to the Town of Johnston, chronic flooding in this area has persistently forced the closure of portions of Atwood Avenue as well as access ramps to Route 6, sometimes for days at a time. These closures have impacted residents, commuters, and the health of the local economy and environment. 

The flooding occurs when excess rain causes the Pocasset River to crest. Drainage issues along Atwood and Hartford Avenues have caused the area to be prone to flooding, with stormwater also flowing to lower-lying areas in the vicinity of Johnston Center. 

With this federal earmark, the project being carried out by the Town of Johnston will allow for the temporary storage of stormwater runoff in oversized drainage pipes until storms pass and the nearby Pocasset River returns to its normal levels. Federal funds will also be used to strengthen connections from the improved drainage system to the town’s water quality pond system. 

Johnston also plans to incorporate water quality treatment within the improved drainage system to maintain a clean, safe water supply for the surrounding communities. By protecting the quality of the town’s water supply and reducing flood-related closures and other impacts, this project will help position the town for increased economic growth. 

Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner secured this earmark in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations law.

New Fed $$ Is On Top Of $1.5 Billion In CHIPS Funding Schumer Secured For GlobalFoundries To Invest Over $13B In U.S., Including Building Second Fab 

Schumer: GlobalFoundries Is Growing And Making Capital Region The Heart Of America’s Chip Supply Chain 

U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer today announced an additional $75 million from his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law for GlobalFoundries to create a first-of-its-kind advanced chips packaging and testing ~~~~ center, adding 100 new good-paying jobs at its facility in Saratoga County. 

Schumer said GlobalFoundries plans to invest approximately $575 million total to build the new NY Advanced Packaging and Photonics Center helping them increase production while bolstering national security by creating a secure facility to package, test, and manufacture semiconductors to support defense applications, AI, and high-performance computing, among other key industries. 

“Thanks to my bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law, GlobalFoundries now plans to build a first-of-its-kind advanced chip Packaging and Photonics Center right here in the Capital Region. I’m proud to deliver this additional $75 million, on top of the $1.5 billion in CHIPS funding that I secured last year, to help the Capital Region and broader Upstate NY’s chips ecosystem grow bigger than we ever thought before,"  said Senator Schumer.  “This new facility in the Capital Region will ensure semiconductors can be securely manufactured, packaged, and tested entirely in the United States, a vital need for our auto, defense, and tech industries like AI. That means new, good-paying jobs here at GlobalFoundries’ Malta facility, decreased reliance on foreign-made chips, and stronger national & economic security for America.” 

Schumer added,  “When I wrote the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law, I made sure there was funding especially for the essential type of chips that GlobalFoundries produces in Malta and that continues to pay dividends as we see this new growth. GlobalFoundries’ expansion in New York is also made possible with the partnership of Governor Hochul, who I thank for her steadfast support and leadership in bringing this industry back to our shores. Today we take another step forward to making the heart of America’s chip industry right here in the Capital Region and Upstate NY.” 

GlobalFoundries plans to invest $575 million in the New York Advanced Packaging and Photonics Center with an additional $186 million investment in research and development over the next 10+ years, creating approximately 100 new good-paying jobs in the Capital Region. 

GlobalFoundries is a leading producer of essential chips that are critical across industries, from mobile phones and artificial intelligence to automobiles and defense technologies. Growth in AI is driving demand for the chips GlobalFoundries produces. The silicon photonics chips this new Center will produce are also in demand in the automotive, communications, radar, and other critical industries. The New York Advanced Packaging and Photonics Center will offer advanced packaging, assembly, and testing, allowing the company to more easily transform chips into individual packages ready for end-product use entirely in the United States. The Center’s new production capabilities will help onshore advanced packaging, which mostly takes place in Asia today, while further boosting GlobalFoundries' production capacity. 

Last year, Schumer  secured  $1.5 billion in funding from his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law to support the expansion of GlobalFoundries’ existing fab in Malta, NY, and the construction of a second, state-of-the-art fab at the same site, in addition to the modernization of the company’s current facility in VT. This investment will approximately triple the capacity of GlobalFoundries’ production in New York over the next decade. 

Currently, there are only four companies outside of China that provide current and mature foundry capabilities at the scale of GlobalFoundries, and GlobalFoundries is the only one of those companies that is headquartered in the United States. GlobalFoundries, a Trusted Foundry for the Department of Defense, is a key supplier of chips for America’s national defense, with strong partnerships with major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin. GlobalFoundries also supplies chips to America’s auto industry with partnerships in place with companies like General Motors, which saw severe shortages of chips during the pandemic, leading to increased prices for cars. The overall CHIPS investment will support the expansion of GlobalFoundries’ current fab focused on automotive chips to help meet soaring demand for chips in cars and get ahead of future supply chain challenges. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce will disburse funds in the coming years as GlobalFoundries meets project milestones. 

In addition to the $1.5 billion award for GlobalFoundries  announced last year  , Schumer has secured billions of dollars in federal funding from his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law. Earlier this week, Schumer announced NY CREATES, Natcast, and the U.S. Department of Commerce reached a final agreement to make Albany NanoTech the first flagship facility of the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), bringing a historic $825 million in federal R&D investment to the region and putting Albany on the global map for semiconductor innovation. Schumer last year  announced  that Micron, which plans to invest $100+ billion over the next two decades – the largest private investment in New York’s history – finalized a $6.1 billion CHIPS funding agreement. Earlier this week, the senator  announced  that Corning Incorporated finalized a $32 million CHIPS funding agreement to make a $315 million investment that would increase production at their Canton facility of specialized glass vital for the semiconductor industry and  announced  Edwards Vacuum finalized a $18 million CHIPS funding agreement to build a new first-of-its-kind-in-the-country $300+ million dry pump manufacturing facility to supply critical technology to the chip industry. 

“We’re proud to partner at the state and federal level on this new center, which is a direct response to our customers asking for more geodiversity in their supply chains and additional support with advanced packaging solutions for GF silicon photonics, Trusted, and 3D/HI offerings,”  said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF.  “The New York Advanced Packaging and Photonics Center will be unique in our industry and will play a vital role in the continued growth of the Empire State’s world-class semiconductor manufacturing and innovation ecosystem.” 

“GlobalFoundries is a proven economic generator that shows just exactly how this industry can transform a region,”  Governor Hochul said.  “Their continued growth and success are a boon to both the Capital Region and the state that attracts residents and businesses alike. GlobalFoundries expansion into advanced packaging for photonics and other applications is good news for New York and I thank the Biden administration, Senator Schumer, and our congressional delegation for ensuring we remain competitive in the 21st century economy.”

Corning Incorporated’s North Country Facility Is The Only One In The Country That Manufactures Specialized Glass Critical To The Chip Industry, And CHIPS $$ Will Fuel $315M Expansion To Help Them Grow 

Schumer: CHIPS Investment Is Signed & Sealed For Corning’s North Country Expansion And New Jobs! 

After  visiting Canton following the passage of his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law  , U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer today announced Corning Incorporated and the Department of Commerce have finalized its CHIPS award of up to $32 million for its North Country expansion. Schumer said this will lock in the funding needed to increase production for their specialized glass vital for the semiconductor industry creating up to 130 new, good-paying manufacturing jobs, including new union jobs, and over 175 union construction jobs. 

“$32 million from my bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law for Corning’s job-creating expansion making specialized glass essential for semiconductors in the North Country is now locked in! Today the feds have signed the deal to say America’s future in glass for the semiconductor industry should be made in Canton, not China,”  said Senator Schumer.  “With the funding now signed and sealed, Corning’s $315 million, 300+ job investment can move forward knowing the funding will be secured for them no matter the administration. The specialized glass made right here in Canton is used in some of the most advanced machinery in the world critical to making microchips we need for technology we use every day, from our phones to our computers and cars, as well as to technology like AI. This finalized agreement is a win-win: for the North Country and America.” 

“Leader Schumer’s visionary leadership, unwavering commitment, and relentless dedication have been instrumental in strengthening the domestic semiconductor supply chain. This strategic investment will advance the continued growth of our Canton, New York facility, enabling us to expand the production of advanced optics components while creating good-paying manufacturing jobs that will support the development of the world's most advanced microchips,”  said Corning Incorporated Chairman and CEO Wendell Weeks. 

Schumer explained today’s finalized CHIPS award will support Corning’s planned $315 million investment that will boost glass production in Canton to support the semiconductor industry. Corning is one of the largest industrial employers in the North Country, and the project is expected to create up to 130 good-paying manufacturing jobs, including new union jobs, in addition to 175 union construction jobs. To carry out the expansion, Corning will work with local unions, including United Steelworkers Local 1026 who represent Corning’s glass-making workforce at the Canton facility and will represent applicable new workers. Specifically, Corning plans to increase the production of High Purity Fused Silica and Ultra Low Expansion Glass, which are key components of deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines and photomasks. DUV and EUV technology are essential to semiconductor manufacturing, and this project will improve EUV performance and help ensure a lower carbon footprint. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce will disburse funds in the coming years as Corning meets project milestones agreed to in the final award. 

Schumer recently announced that following years of advocacy, Albany NanoTech has finalized an agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce to be home to the country’s first National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) facility as the NSTC headquarters  focusing on EUV research  . By increasing production at Corning’s North Country plant, more American-made glass critical to the technology required by new chip fabs such as Micron, GlobalFoundries, and Wolfspeed in New York will be made available, strengthening U.S. supply chains and offering microchip producers shorter wait times and improved responsiveness from an American-made product. 

To support both the company’s workforce and the broader community’s childcare infrastructure, Corning also plans to invest $300,000 per year for the duration of the proposed project to support the St. Lawrence County Childcare Training Program, which would help build and stabilize the child care workforce and increase child care supply for the community, making it easier for employees to find and obtain care and helping the company access the additional workers needed to make this expansion a success. 

Schumer  visited Corning in 2022  to explain how his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law will help keep the U.S. on the cutting-edge of innovation, train a new generation of tech and manufacturing workers, lower costs for families, strengthen national security, and specifically boost facilities like Canton’s. Corning’s Canton location leverages its expertise in glass science to make some of the world’s purest glass. The plant has become a world leader in the production of specialized glasses ideal for advanced microchip production and is the only location in the country making this critical product. Corning Incorporated is one of the largest employers in New York, with over 7,000 employees across the state, including over 300 in St. Lawrence County. 

In addition to this major investment in Canton, Schumer said his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law is helping boost Corning Incorporated’s manufacturing efforts at its plants across Upstate NY. In 2022, Schumer helped announce a  $139M, 270 job expansion in Monroe County by Corning Incorporated  to support optic technology, which is critical in the microchip manufacturing industry. Schumer said that with further expansion of domestic semiconductor production, more and more companies will be relying on Corning Incorporated for their expertise in innovation, glass, and specialty tech to support their growth. 

“The Empire State is becoming a national leader in advanced manufacturing because of the investments New York has made in this industry and the extraordinary help of President Biden. New York State has the talent, infrastructure and innovation to continue on this trajectory and the best is yet to come. My 2025 State of the State includes new initiatives to grow this critical industry, and we’ll continue doing everything in our power to great jobs and boost economic growth,”  said Governor Kathy Hochul.

This finalized federal investment will help ensure NY’s semiconductor supply chain is made right here in Genesee County,”  said Senator Schumer.  “The signed CHIPS award is a major step forward for this $300 million, 600 job project that will be a pivotal stop on America’s semiconductor superhighway. All the major semiconductor companies in New York and across America need this vacuum technology for their chip fabs, that only Edwards will make in the USA. It is a prime example of why our region is growing as the nation’s semiconductor ‘Tech Hub.’ With the funding from my bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law now signed and sealed Edwards Vacuum’s growth in Western NY can continue knowing the funding will be secured for them to tap no matter the administration. This is a win-win-win: for Genesee County, for Upstate NY, and America.” 

This federal funding will support a planned $300+ million investment and 600 good-paying jobs when the facility reaches full production capacity. Schumer explained all chip fabs need vacuum technology such as that produced by Edwards to power the sophisticated equipment and state-of-the-art machine tools needed to make microchips. Those tools use vacuum pumps, like those that will now be made in Western New York, to manipulate the chip wafers and control industrial gasses needed to manufacture the finished microchips. By bringing manufacturing to New York, new chip fabs such as Micron and GlobalFoundries in New York, and Intel in Ohio can have access to critical dry pumps that will now be made in the U.S., offering chip producers shorter wait times, improved responsiveness, lower risks of supply chain disruptions, and reduced CO2 emissions from an American-made product. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce will disburse funds in the coming years as Edwards Vacuum meets project milestones agreed to in the final award. 

Schumer has been a relentless champion for expanding the semiconductor supply chain in Western NY. Schumer  personally called Geert Follens, who was then President of the Vacuum Technique Business Area for Edwards  parent company Atlas Copco Group, to urge the global semiconductor supply chain company to expand in Upstate New York. Later that year Schumer announced with Governor Hochul that Edwards Vacuum had heeded their calls and  planned to build their new manufacturing facility in Genesee County  . Last year, Schumer  celebrated Edwards Vacuum’s groundbreaking ceremony in Genesee County  for Phase 1 of their construction which is expected to be completed in 2025. 

Schumer also helped  the Buffalo-Rochester-Syracuse region win the prestigious Tech Hub designation  to support the buildout of the semiconductor supply chain in Upstate NY through his bipartisan CHIPS & Science Law and last year secured  a major $40 million investment to implement the Tech Hub’s work  with companies like Edwards. The proposal called the “NY SMART I-Corridor Tech Hub” has built on the historic investments Schumer delivered that have spurred a boom in semiconductor manufacturing and innovation across Upstate NY. Edwards Vacuum is working with Genesee Community College and Tech Hub partners like Monroe Community College, Erie Community College, and the Northland Workforce Training Center to help them hire and train hundreds of new workers. 

“The Empire State is becoming a national leader in advanced manufacturing because of the investments New York has made in this industry and the extraordinary help of President Biden. New York State has the talent, infrastructure and innovation to continue on this trajectory and the best is yet to come. My 2025 State of the State includes new initiatives to grow this critical industry, and we’ll continue doing everything in our power to create jobs and boost economic growth,”  said Governor Kathy Hochul.

Schumer And Cramer’s Legislation Would Celebrate Olympic U.S. Men’s Ice Hockey Champions With Congressional Gold Medals, Including One To Be Displayed At New York’s Lake Placid Olympic Center 

Schumer, Cramer: The Time Has Come To Award Congressional Gold Medals To One Of America’s Favorite Olympic Gold Medal Teams! 

U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer, introduced legislation to award Congressional Gold Medals to the “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic Men’s Ice Hockey Team that won a gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, NY. The team defeated the mighty four-time Olympic champion Soviet Union Team in the semi-final game of the tournament, and went on to win a gold medal in a thrilling come-from-behind game against the Finnish National Team. Schumer and Cramer’s legislation will award the team with three Congressional Gold Medals, including one to be displayed at the Lake Placid Olympic Center in Upstate New York. 

“In one of the greatest sports moments in American history, our nation witnessed a miracle when 20 college and minor league athletes on our U.S. Men’s Ice Hockey Team beat the vaunted Soviet Union Team at the 1980 Winter Olympic games in Lake Placid. The U.S. Team demonstrated great American fighting spirit and a gritty determination to prevail against all odds, that propelled them to a miraculous victory over the Soviet Red Army juggernaut and sparked pride and patriotism across the nation that has inspired generations of Americans since. They then went on to a come-from-behind win in the gold medal game against the Finns, cementing Lake Placid’s hallowed place in American sports history. I’m proud to introduce this legislation to award Congressional Gold Medals for one of America’s favorite and inspirational Olympic gold medal teams,”  said Senator Schumer.  “Great moments are born from great challenge, and 45 years later this win still resonates with so many Americans and serves as an indisputable moment of pride that unites the country. To paraphrase the broadcast that day by Al Michaels, decades later we ask: Do you still believe in miracles? YES! That is why we should commemorate this moment and Lake Placid’s place in American history by awarding this Olympic Gold Medal team with Congressional Gold Medals to be displayed at the Lake Placid Olympic Center and other Olympic and hockey exhibits across the country.” 

In February 1980, in one of the greatest upsets in all of sports history, the United States Olympic Men’s Ice Hockey Team defeated the Soviet Union’s ice hockey team 4-3 at the 1980 Winter Olympic men’s hockey tournament in Lake Placid. Team USA, comprised of 20 amateur collegiate and minor league hockey players, defeated the four-time Olympic champion Soviet Union Team in a game now referred to as the “Miracle on Ice.” Team USA went on to win an Olympic Gold Medal, and the game was a turning point for American hockey and led to an explosion of pride and patriotism at a time when the United States was struggling with morale due to high prices and hostages held in Iran. 

Schumer and Cramer’s legislation – which is co-sponsored by , along with U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, U.S. Senator Gary Peters, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper, U.S. Senator Mike Rounds, U.S. Senator Tina Smith, and U.S. Senator John R. Curtis – will recognize the 45  th  anniversary of the game, awarding three Congressional Gold Medals to members of the team for display at the Lake Placid Olympic Center, as well as the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum in Colorado and the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in Minnesota to recognize this remarkable achievement.

As Schumer’s First Major Act As Majority Leader, He Secured Pension Fix So Union Members Could Get Hard-Earned Pensions & Relief They Need And Earned 

Schumer: Upstate NY Union Operating Engineers & Families Can Breathe Sigh Of Relief With The Restored Pensions They Rightfully Earned 

U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer today announced that, after years of advocacy to secure relief for ailing multiemployer pension plans for union workers, Upstate NY’s International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Fund covering union construction engineers from Buffalo to Syracuse to Albany and across Upstate NY will receive an approximately $85.5 million pension-fix from the Schumer-sponsored  American Rescue Plan  . The federal relief will restore full pension benefits for over 6,400 union workers and their families across upstate from Buffalo to the Capital Region. 

“Upstate New York’s operating engineers union members work hard every day to ensure our buildings, roads, highways, and bridges are safe. These are the men and women who operate heavy equipment, like bulldozers, backhoes and graders on construction sites, who worked hard, played by the rules and paid into pension plans that – through no fault of their own – were at-risk of being drastically cut or even completely disappearing. So I’m very proud to deliver over $85 million in federal relief to help almost 6,500 union construction workers across Upstate ensure their hard-earned pension benefits remain intact for many years into the future and ensure they can retire after a lifetime of hard work,”  said Senator Schumer  . “I made sure as my first act as Majority Leader to pass the  American Rescue Plan  with a key provision to deliver the pension relief to our union brothers and sister and their families they have desperately needed.” 

Schumer said the Syracuse-based  IUOE Upstate New York Engineers Fund  , which approximately 6,400+ workers in the construction industry, will receive approximately $85.5 million in special financial assistance. SFA will enable the plan to continue to pay retirement benefits without reduction for many years into the future. 

Schumer explained that after the  2008 financial crash  , many union workers’ in multiemployer pension plans were in danger of collapse due to out-of-control speculation on Wall Street. Multiemployer plans are created through agreements between employers and a union, with plans typically involving multiple employers in a single industry or related industries. Countless families and workers faced the prospect of losing out on retirement savings – through no fault of their own. 

Senator Schumer fought to include the Butch Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan – securing pension solvency in his very first major bill as majority leader. Before the American Rescue Plan over 200 multiemployer plans were on pace to become insolvent in the near term, risking benefits for millions of workers and their families. The law created the  Special Financial Assistance program  administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to protect benefits for millions of workers, reverse harsh pension cuts, and put existing plans on a path to solvency through 2051. To date, the program has provided billions in federal assistance to support thousands of construction industry workers.

“As a first-generation American myself, I know that the vast majority of immigrants are hard-working people who pay taxes, follow the law, and contribute so much to our society. We cannot allow hateful and xenophobic rhetoric to obscure that fact. At the same time, any individual who commits a violent crime must be held accountable for their actions—including deportation for noncitizen offenders. I voted for this legislation because it further reiterates that sexual and domestic abuse are serious crimes under the law, delivering justice for victims and making our communities safer for everyone."

10:38:37 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:38:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC –  On Tuesday, January 14, U.S. Representative Andrea Salinas (OR-06) joined Oregon's U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with U.S. Reps. Val Hoyle (OR-04), Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Maxine Dexter (OR-03), and Janelle Bynum (OR-05) to announce $45 million in funding to Oregon State University for the Corvallis Microfluidics Tech Hub (CorMic). These  f  unds will be used to develop microfluidics technologies and help businesses commercialize their discoveries. 

"The CorMic Tech Hub is an outstanding example of regional cooperation that will further solidify the Pacific Northwest's role as a leader in the innovation economy of the future. This partnership between academia, community, and industry partners will build Oregon’s capacity to commercialize and manufacture new technologies – creating a diverse and accessible workforce pipeline that benefits workers and industry alike,”  said Rep. Salinas.  “I was proud to be a vocal advocate for this funding along with my Oregon colleagues, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to CorMic and every Oregonian who helped make this a reality. I can’t wait to see these funds unlock new economic frontiers for our state and our nation." 

“This federal investment in the world-class research led by OSU will generate huge benefits for jobs statewide and for the innovation that keeps powering the Silicon Forest and Oregon’s semiconductor industry to be the heartbeat of domestic chips production,”  said Sen. Wyden.  “Today’s wonderful news for Corvallis and the entire region didn’t happen by osmosis – it’s the product of great teamwork that reflects the very best of the Oregon Way pulling together on solutions that make our state an even better place to live and work.” 

“Another huge win for Oregon’s storied semiconductor industry is in the books!”  said Sen. Merkley.  “This major funding boost further cements our state’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, all while creating good-paying local jobs in the process. The Corvallis Microfluidics Tech Hub will leverage Oregon State University and their partners to be at the forefront of tomorrow’s technologies for everything from semiconductor chip cooling to lifesaving medical breakthroughs.” 

"Creating rural jobs in the semiconductor industry has been part of the promise of public and private sector partners working on CorMic,”  said Rep. Hoyle.  “This funding supports the world-class, cutting-edge research at Oregon State University and its partners, like the University of Oregon. This award builds on Oregon’s microchip innovation and development and gives our upcoming generation an opportunity to find good tech jobs right here at home. I’d like to thank the entire Oregon delegation and Secretary Raimondo for helping make this a reality.” 

“We crafted the CHIPS and Science Act to bolster our domestic semiconductor industry, spur research and innovation, and create good-paying jobs,”  said Rep. Bonamici.  “These investments in the expansion of HP’s facility in Corvallis and the Corvallis Microfluidics Tech Hub led by Oregon State University show how this legislation is delivering for Oregonians. Our state is a leader in semiconductor innovation, and I look forward to seeing how these initiatives and investments shape future growth in the sector.” 

"With today's investment, Oregon will lead the nation in the technological advances required for a 21st economy,"  said Rep. Dexter.  "Semi-conductors will power the future. And our region will power their production." 

"When I served in the Oregon State Legislature, I consistently fought to direct investments towards Oregon's chip manufacturing industry to create jobs, bolster our economy, and strengthen our national security,"  said Rep. Bynum.  "Today's funding announcement will help establish our state as a global leader in chip manufacturing and, in turn, provide more good opportunities to our kids." 

“CorMic showcases the deep expertise in microfluidics in our region, a technology of great importance in semiconductors, biotech, and chemical manufacturing, and also the strength of partnerships in the Willamette Valley,”  said Tom Weller, the Michael and Judith Gaulke Chair in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State who is leading the CorMic effort.  “Government, higher education, the private sector, venture development, and community-based organizations all work as one unit in CorMic. The most exciting outcome of this award may be what it means for our innovators in the region, who will gain new access to state-of-the-art facilities and experienced know-how to grow and scale new technologies and companies.” 

Microfluidics is an emerging industry dedicated to semiconductor cooling to help reduce the temperature, improve the performance of integrated circuits, and make them safer. It also has significant biotechnology applications to drastically change how we diagnose, treat, and develop cures for illnesses. 

The Department of Commerce’s choice to award these funds to CorMic recognizes its unique position at the center of research, public, and private investments. HP, Intel, NVIDIA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific have all joined CorMic. These industry partners, along with Oregon's leading research universities - Oregon State University, the University of Oregon, and the Oregon Health and Science University - and community colleges across the state, will collaborate to build a robust technology ecosystem in our region, from workforce training to research and development and commercialization. Oregon's Silicon Forest has long been a national leader in semiconductor design and manufacturing, and this award will support our state's leadership on the next generation of these technologies. 

CorMic has also partnered with the City of Corvallis to ensure housing supply keeps pace with job creation, including allowing middle-income housing in low-density zones. 

The Department of Commerce estimates that CorMic could create up to 12,000 jobs by 2033.

Following a vote on the bill, Quigley released the following statement: 

“Instead of focusing on lowering prices for American families or addressing the growing natural disaster in California, Republicans are using the first weeks of the new Congress to attack vulnerable populations. This time, they’ve chosen to target kids. 

“Prioritizing this legislation is not only a waste of this body’s time but harms all young people – including and especially the young women Republicans purport to want to protect. This legislation opens the door to subjecting all female students to intrusive demands for medical tests, and it could force any girl to undergo invasive medical exams to “prove” that they’re a girl. 

“I’ve played sports my entire life and raised two daughters who played youth sports. Banning trans kids from sports would at no point have improved the experiences of me or my daughters. All children deserve to play sports. I will not stand idly by while Republicans attack children and ignore the real issues everyday Americans care about.”

Below are Quigley’s floor remarks as prepared for delivery: 

Mr. Speaker, this bill is cynical, mean, and scapegoating of a vulnerable population. To make matters worse, this is a hateful attack on kids. 

Trans kids deserve to play sports just like their peers, and congress must not bar them from the field. All young people should be able to benefit from team sports – building character, developing friendships, and improving their mental health. 

Organizations like the NCAA, International Olympic Committee, and state athletic boards have included trans athletes for years. Instead of following their lead, my colleagues want to codify hate and discrimination against all transgender kids in all sports. 

Not so long ago, all women were banned from school sports until the passage of title ix in the 1970s and even then, extremists preached that women playing sports was the end of sports as we know it. I firmly believe that today’s rhetoric about trans women and girls is no different and will soon be seen as just outdated and absurd. 

We must lead with empathy and a commitment to learn from our neighbors. 

Every child should be able to join a team that is consistent with their gender and benefits from sports.

Quigley also reiterated his call for Speaker Johnson to approve the hanging of a plaque commemorating the police officers who protected our republic, including the U.S. Capitol Police Department and Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. The plaque was required by law to be placed by March 15, 2023. 

Quigley says  , in part, “We need a clear accounting of what happened and clear accountability to ensure this never happens again. Unfortunately, under this incoming President and Congress, it appears we will get neither. President-elect Trump has said he wants to pardon the rioters. These are folks who have been convicted in a court of law. And in a dark twist on accountability, Trump and his allies are threatening retribution against the Democrats and Republicans who served on the committee that investigated January 6.” 

Quigley  continues, “This is a perversion of the truth and justice. For those of us who were on Capitol Hill that day - who saw the violence, smelled the pepper spray, and heard the screams - we have a opportunity to remember that day for what it was: A dark stain on our nation’s history. And we have an opportunity to commemorate those in uniform who bravely stood up to the mob of rioters." 

Video of Quigley’s remarks today is available  HERE  (link is external)  . 

Quigley’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below: 

Last week, the House and Senate oversaw the certification of the 2024 election. It was a quick, smooth process. There were no riots, no violence. We completed the peaceful transfer of power as the founding fathers envisioned it. 

Now compare last week’s election certification with what we witnessed four years ago. Thousands attacked the Capitol. They shattered windows, smashed down doors, assaulted police officers. It was a violent mob, and people died as a result. All in an attempt to stop the certification of a legitimate election. The insurrectionists and rioters threatened Vice President Pence and referred to him as a “dead man walking,” if he didn’t illegally reject the election results. 

Directly following January 6, leaders on both sides of the aisle spoke out against the anti-democratic acts of that day. 

Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said, “the violence, destruction, and chaos we saw earlier was unacceptable, undemocratic, and un-American. It was the saddest day I’ve ever had serving as a member of this institution.” 

Former Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was even more clear in his condemnation and assignment of blame. He said: “there’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.” 

Now, four years later, there is a concerted effort to rewrite history. Our incoming President has called January 6 a “day of love,” and others across the aisle have claimed it was a legitimate form of protest. 

Well I was there. I saw the violence with my own eyes. And the scenes we witnessed will haunt this institution forever. 

We need a clear accounting of what happened and clear accountability - to ensure this never happens again. Unfortunately, under this incoming President and Congress, it appears we will get neither. 

President-elect Trump has said he wants to pardon the rioters. These are folks who have been convicted in a court of law. And in a dark twist on accountability, Trump and his allies are threatening retribution against the Democrats and Republicans who served on the committee that investigated January 6. 

“They should go to jail,” Trump said of Members of Congress sought to uncover the truth about January 6. 

So let’s just recap: The people who broke into the Capitol, injured 140 officers, and threatened to kill the Vice President and other senior leaders should be pardoned. And the elected officials who performed their Constitutional duty to investigate the largest mass assaults of law enforcement and the greatest assault on our democracy should be jailed. 

This is a perversion of the truth and justice. 

For those of us who were on Capitol Hill that day - who saw the violence, smelled the pepper spray, and heard the screams - we have a opportunity to remember that day for what it was: A dark stain on our nation’s history. 

And we have an opportunity to commemorate those in uniform who bravely stood up to the mob of rioters. 

But they didn’t just protect me; they protected one of our greatest American traditions: the peaceful transfer of power. 

In 2022, Congress commissioned a memorial to be installed on the front of the Capitol listing the names of those who defended the Capitol on that fateful day. Three years later it has yet to be mounted. 

I expect more from my colleagues across the aisle. Because if we can’t be honest about what happened on January 6 - and if we can’t, at minimum, come together to put up a plaque commemorating those who protected us and our institutions on January 6 - Then perhaps we should install a plaque like the one from Dante’s Inferno: 

“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”

The remarks followed  a statement  released by Quigley last week, in which he initially called for the establishment of a peacekeeping force in Gaza, composed of Arab states. 

Quigley says  , in part, “Civil society has broken down completely in Gaza and the territory urgently needs a peacekeeping force to help restore order. This force - ideally composed of Arab states - will play a critical role now and in post-war Gaza. Hamas cannot remain in power and the people of Gaza deserve new political leadership that will prioritize peace as they establish a new government.” 

Quigley’s previous statement is available  HERE  . 

Video of Quigley’s remarks today is available  HERE  (link is external)  . 

Quigley’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below: 

On October 7th, 2023, the people of Israel experienced the greatest terror attack in their nation’s history. 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were abducted in what was the most severe attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with at least a third of those believed to be dead. 

I was horrified by the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th. But I am encouraged by reports that indicate that Israel and Hamas are closer than ever to reaching a ceasefire agreement that would return all remaining hostages held in Gaza to their families. 

Still, the reality of the matter is whether a ceasefire is reached - and whether that ceasefire lasts - we must act now. 

As I have for my entire career, I firmly believe in Israel’s right to defend itself. Israel has been a critical ally in the region and has earned our support as it defends against threats from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in Gaza. Still, the manner in which Israel defends itself matters. 

After 15 months of war, I believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has overseen a military campaign that has had catastrophic consequences not only for the people of Gaza but for his own people as well. As Israel’s strongest ally, we have a responsibility to ensure that the legitimate anger felt by its citizens and the rest of the world after October 7th does not spiral into endless violence. 

What began as a war of defense has devolved into a war of retribution and widespread destruction. Over 47,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, though a recent study published by the Lancet estimates the death toll could be up to 40 percent higher. The majority of those killed are women and children. 90 percent of Gaza’s population is internally displaced and the threat of widespread famine has lingered for months. At least six newborns have recently died of hypothermia. The number of children killed in Gaza during the war exceeds the total number of children killed in conflicts worldwide over the last four years. And thousands of children like Malek Al Kafarna are grappling with life-altering injuries as a direct result of the war. 

On October 24, 2023, 13-year-old Malek was waiting for food coupons at a market in a refugee camp when an airstrike hit and blew off his left arm. 

It bears repeating that Hamas is an evil terrorist organization that cynically exploits civilians and has little to no regard for life - even the lives of other Palestinians. Research shows that terrorist organizations have rarely been dismantled through military force. Precisely because Hamas is such a threat, we must approach defeating them with a rational, evidence-based approach. 

Research by RAND shows that terrorist groups end through targeted intelligence operations or through a negotiated political settlement. In fact, I fear that the war in Gaza will act as a recruitment tool for Hamas and will create a new generation of fighters who will seek revenge. After over a year of fighting, Hamas is weakened but has not been eliminated nor have the remaining Israeli hostages been released. 

The last time hostages were released was in November 2023, and they gained their freedom as a result of diplomatic negotiations. What is urgently needed to bring an end to this brutal war is a diplomatic solution. 

Both the Israeli government and Hamas must agree to end the fighting, release the remaining hostages, and flood the Gaza Strip with desperately needed food and medical supplies. It is in Israel’s security interests to have a stable neighbor in a Palestinian state. 

Civil society has broken down completely in Gaza and the territory urgently needs a peacekeeping force to help restore order. This force - ideally composed of Arab states - will play a critical role now and in post-war Gaza. Hamas cannot remain in power and the people of Gaza deserve new political leadership that will prioritize peace as they establish a new government. Ideally, that government will be a reformed Palestinian Authority empowered to govern both in the West Bank and in Gaza. 

The ultimate goal for all parties must be a lasting peace. That can only be reached through a two-state solution. 

We have the opportunity to change the trajectory of the lives of children like Malek Al Kafarna. 

In 10 years, he’ll be 24. The choices we make in the coming weeks and months, can either leave Malek desperate and hopeless - a prime candidate for recruitment for Hamas. Or we can give him and the more than one million children living in Gaza the opportunity to grow up in a world that has prioritized peace and security. 

We must work towards ending this war and building a positive future for both Palestinians and Israelis.

“We are proud to reestablish the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus for the 119th Congress and reaffirm our enduring commitment to the vital US-Ukraine partnership. Established in 1997, just six years after Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union, for nearly three decades, the Ukraine Caucus has served as an indispensable forum within the US House of Representatives for strengthening bilateral relations and fostering a deeper appreciation of the Ukrainian-American community’s rich culture and contributions,"  said the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus. 

"As we begin the 119th Congress, and our friends in Ukraine continue to stand resilient against Russia’s unprovoked and brutal war of aggression, our work has never been more urgent. Together, we stand united in our mission to ensure Ukraine can achieve victory in its fight for peace and liberty, bolster transatlantic security, and champion the democratic values that bind our two nations,"  concluded the Co-Chairs.

10:38:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington DC – Today, Rep.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz (  FL-25) released the following statement on the hostage deal and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas: 

“  My heart is full of hope for the relief that is about to arrive for hundreds of Israeli family members and the people of Israel, who have waited 15 months for this day. I am deeply grateful to President Biden and his administration for their tireless work to achieve an agreement to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza after 467 days of unimaginable hardship. This deal is a defining moment for President Biden's legacy and history will remember his commitment to securing our ally Israel from Iran and its terrorist proxies, returning the hostages, and seeking a just and lasting peace for Israelis, Palestinians and their neighbors. 

“Throughout this crisis, I have used my platform to uplift the voices and stories of the hostages and their families, especially those who are Americans. There is nothing we can do to alleviate the suffering these families have experienced over the last 15 months, but I am hopeful that this agreement will bring peace and provide relief for them, and allow for rapid delivery of aid to innocent Palestinians who have been victims of Hamas as well. It is now up to all of us, including the incoming Administration, to see this agreement through and ensure that all hostages - the living and remains - are returned to their families along with a guarantee that all parties live up to their responsibilities. 

“I hope that this deal can open the door for a long-term ceasefire where Gaza is free of Hamas rule, the beginning of Gaza’s reconstruction, and reinforcing Israel's security through normalization with Saudi Arabia and joint efforts to counter Iran. I look forward to supporting these efforts as a co-chair of the Abraham Accords Caucus and working with the Trump Administration to ensure complete implementation of this agreement.”

10:38:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington DC – Today, Rep.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz (  FL-25) released the following statement on the Biden Administration removing the Cuban Communist regime’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism: 

“  President Biden has a strong record of foreign policy accomplishments that have made our country and world safer. A crucial component of his legacy will be his efforts to free political prisoners, wrongfully detained Americans, and hostages abroad. I appreciate the Administration's consistent efforts to free more than 500 political prisoners wrongfully jailed and tortured by the Cuban Communist regime due to the July 11, 2021 pro-democracy protests and I am relieved that these individuals will be finally released. 

“I have fiercely advocated for the freedom of unjustly detained Cubans, including pro-democracy advocates like Maykel “Osorbo” Castillo and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, and I will continue to call for the immediate, unconditional release of all political prisoners held by the regime as a precondition to sanctions relief of any kind. 

“On the contrary, the Cuban regime has doubled down on brutality—violently crushing pro-democracy protests, arbitrarily jailing and torturing Cubans and Americans for political leverage, robbing their citizens to fund widespread espionage against the U.S., providing safe harbor to individuals complicit in terror attacks against America and our treaty allies, and funding and ordering transnational repression and assassination. Any change in the regime's status has not been earned and I have no confidence that rewarding the Cuban dictatorship will meaningfully improve their despicable track record or improve conditions for ordinary Cubans. 

“On this basis, I strongly disagree with the President's decision to remove Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, lift sanctions on the Cuban regime's military and kleptocrats, and rescind additional regulations which deny resources for the regime's crimes against its own people. The Cuban regime has failed to demonstrate that they will cease to commit atrocities, destabilize the Western Hemisphere, or collude with our adversaries and terrorist entities to endanger Americans.”

Declaración de Wasserman Schultz sobre la eliminación de la designación de Cuba como estado patrocinador del terrorismo por parte de la administración Biden 

Washington DC –  La representante Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25) emitió la siguiente declaración sobre la eliminación por parte de la Administración Biden de la designación del régimen comunista cubano como Estado patrocinador del terrorismo: 

“  El presidente Biden tiene un sólido historial de logros en política exterior que han hecho que nuestro país y el mundo sean más seguros. Un componente crucial de su legado serán sus esfuerzos por liberar a los presos políticos, a los estadounidenses detenidos injustamente y a los rehenes en el extranjero. Aprecio los constantes esfuerzos de la Administración para liberar a más de 500 presos políticos injustamente encarcelados y torturados por el régimen comunista cubano debido a las protestas a favor de la democracia del 11 de julio de 2021 y me siento aliviado de que estas personas finalmente sean liberadas. 

“He defendido ferozmente la libertad de los cubanos detenidos injustamente, incluidos defensores de la democracia como Maykel “Osorbo” Castillo y Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara, y seguiré pidiendo la liberación inmediata e incondicional de todos los prisioneros políticos retenidos por el régimen como una condición previa para el alivio de sanciones de cualquier tipo. 

“Por el contrario, el régimen cubano ha redoblado su apuesta por la brutalidad: aplastando violentamente protestas a favor de la democracia, encarcelando y torturando arbitrariamente a cubanos y estadounidenses para obtener influencia política, robando a sus ciudadanos para financiar un espionaje generalizado contra Estados Unidos, brindando refugio a individuos cómplices de ataques terroristas contra Estados Unidos y nuestros aliados del tratado, y financiar y ordenar represión y asesinato transnacional. Cualquier cambio en el estatus del régimen no se ha ganado y no tengo confianza en que recompensar a la dictadura cubana mejore significativamente su despreciable historial o mejore las condiciones de los cubanos comunes y corrientes. 

“Sobre esta base, estoy totalmente en desacuerdo con la decisión del presidente de eliminar a Cuba de la lista de Estados Patrocinadores del Terrorismo, levantar las sanciones a los militares y cleptócratas del régimen cubano y rescindir regulaciones adicionales que niegan recursos para los crímenes del régimen contra su propio pueblo. El régimen cubano no ha logrado demostrar que dejará de cometer atrocidades, desestabilizar el hemisferio occidental o confabularse con nuestros adversarios y entidades terroristas para poner en peligro a los estadounidenses.”

Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Representative Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) joined her congressional colleagues on a bipartisan resolution, led by U.S. Reps. Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) and Young Kim (CA-40), celebrating January 13, 2025, as Korean American Day—marking the 122  nd  anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United States on January 13, 1903. Senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) introduced a companion resolution in the Senate.  You can read the full resolution text  here  . 

“As one of the first Korean American women elected to Congress in our nation’s history, I will always advocate for the safety, prosperity, recognition and inclusion of our community. Korean American Day symbolizes the perseverance, strength, and resilience of our people, and I am proud to recognize this holiday and our heritage,”  said Rep. Strickland (WA-10). 

“Korean Americans have made incredible contributions to our nation in art, business, education, as well as the private and public sectors, and their story continues to inspire communities across the country,”  said Rep. Gomez (CA-34)  . “I’m introducing this resolution with Representative Young Kim and Senator Andy Kim to commemorate Korean American Day and celebrate the hard work, family bonds, and unbreakable spirit of Korean Americans. As the representative of LA’s Koreatown, the largest population of Korean Americans in the U.S., I’ll continue to work alongside the Korean American community to achieve more progress in LA and across the country.” 

“For 122 years, Korean Americans have found success in the classroom, the workplace, and even right here in the halls of Congress, working to make our nation a better place,”  said Rep. Young Kim (CA-40)  . “I’m proud to help lead a bipartisan resolution honoring Korean American Day as one of the first Korean American women in Congress and the representative of a vibrant Korean American community in Southern California. I’ll keep fighting in Congress to ensure the American dream I have lived remains alive for future generations.” 

“For the last 122years, Korean immigrants have shattered barriers, enriched our culture, and become an essential part of America’s powerful diversity,”  said Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) Chair  . “On Korean American Day, I am proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this resolution honoring all that Korean Americans have contributed to our communities. We must continue fighting ensure that their stories are commemorated as part of our nation’s history.” 

“As the 6th Korean-American to serve in Congress, I am honored to co-sponsor this resolution celebrating 122 years since the first Koreans came to America,”  said Rep. Dave Min (CA-47  ). “My parents immigrated to the United States in 1970 with little money and no family or friends but were able to achieve the American Dream for themselves and for their children through hard work and perseverance. Our story is the Korean-American story, and it is the story of America. I am so proud of the tremendous success of the Korean-American community over the course of my lifetime, and I will keep fighting to make sure everyone has a fair shot, including the two million Korean Americans across the nation.” 

“I am thrilled to join Rep. Gomez in reintroducing this resolution celebrating Korean American Day,”  said Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28)  . “As Chair Emerita of CAPAC, I remain, as always, proud to stand alongside the Korean American community in my Southern California district and join my colleagues to celebrate their contributions to our nation. From leaders to veterans, athletes, business owners, actors, artists, and so much more – we celebrate all that Korean Americans have sacrificed and contributed to U.S. history.” 

“Korean American Day is an incredible opportunity to join together and celebrate the lasting impact of Korean American culture, history, and achievement,”  said Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ).  “As we mark 122 years since the first Koreans came to this country, I am humbled to bring this bill forward just weeks after being sworn in as the first Korean American Senator. My parents’ journey to this country just over 50 years ago, the family they built, and my chance to serve New Jersey in Congress all would not have been possible without those who came before us. Today we recognize the generations who built our cherished communities and commit to uplifting all those to come.”

This bipartisan piece of legislation would address military housing affordability by diversifying housing options for servicemembers serving in high-cost areas. 

This legislation will diversify the housing options available to lower-enlisted servicemembers serving in high-cost areas while also creating an increased Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) for buildings located within 15 miles of large military installations. Reps. Moore and Strickland have partnered with local stakeholders to create an additional arm of the LIHTC program to stimulate developer interest in building affordable housing near military installations. 

“Servicemembers and their families should be able to afford to live where they are stationed. This is important for their quality of life, and affects readiness,”  said Strickland.  “This credit encourages the building of more affordable housing near large military installations.” 

“When I got onto the Ways and Means Committee, Clearfield Mayor Mark Shepherd approached me with an idea to address the housing affordability challenges burdening our lower-enlisted servicemembers. Since then, my team and I ran with his idea and drafted legislation that we are reintroducing for the 119th Congress. The Low Income Housing for Defense Communities Act will bring much needed relief and productivity to military families serving near major bases. I am so grateful Mayor Shepherd approached me with this idea, and I’m proud of the work we’ve done advancing it to this point,”  said Moore.  “Housing has become a national security issue, as it impacts the readiness of Hill Air Force Base (HAFB) in Utah’s First District. As hundreds of lower-enlisted servicemembers are struggling to afford housing near the base and officers are being forced to turn down assignments in Utah because of the difficult real estate market, this bill will spur development interest for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit construction near large installations like HAFB. I thank Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland for her partnership in reintroducing this bill, and I look forward to seeing this bill make a meaningful impact in the lives of our servicemembers in Utah and across the nation.” 

“Across the nation, our military members continue to struggle with the lack of affordable housing,”  said Clearfield Mayor Mark Shepherd.  “The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) continues to fall short of the rents in the communities surrounding the installation, and as such, two, three, and even four service members are forced to share an apartment just so they can afford the rent. The rising cost of housing coupled with a housing allowance which has not kept pace with the market requires over 24% of our active duty military members to receive food assistance from local pantries and the SNAP program. While there may be low-income housing options in the areas surrounding the installations, the list of applicants for these units is long and the military members either won’t qualify either because their housing allowance is included as part their income or they are so far down the list that they are often relocated to their next assignment before they make it to the top of the list. This bill will allow developers to use Low Income Housing Tax Credits to build high quality rental units where the military members will have priority for the units. It also allows those military members to qualify for existing low income housing, in areas where it is available, by changing the income calculation to exclude their housing allowance. Having our military members who have volunteered to put their lives on the line to defend our nation live in sub-par housing, or struggle to afford food because all of their available income goes to housing, sends the wrong message to the military members and to the communities in which they live. I applaud Congressman Moore on his commitment to ensure our military members are treated with the dignity and respect they so deserve when it comes to their housing needs.” 

“We appreciate Congressman Moore’s attention to the growing affordable housing crisis, and his commitment to finding a solution based on what we know works – the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit,”  said Emily Cadik, CEO of the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition.  “Military families are experiencing the same challenges finding affordable housing faced by millions of Americans, and expanding affordable housing supply through this proven program would provide sorely needed relief.” 

Background: 

Constrained by geographic limitations and military installation footprint, housing development around many growing defense communities is unaffordable for lower-enlisted service members. At the same time, the MILCON backlog and military dormitory crisis has resulted in servicemembers being forced off base to seek housing they cannot afford. Fueled by pandemic population shifts and Department of Defense programs at Hill Air Force Base, Utah experienced a 27% increase in housing costs and 18% increase in population in 2021 alone. Accordingly, approximately 70% of Joint Base Lewis-McChord’s population in Washington, which consists of nearly 55,000 personnel, live off base. 

The bill excludes BAH from the income calculation for LIHTC purposes. While BAH provides uniformed service members compensation based on housing costs in local markets, this provision would help military members secure housing in existing and future LIHTC properties for which they may not otherwise qualify. With anecdotal evidence suggesting that military members are hesitant to self-identify as “low-income,” the bill’s intent is to help classify lower-enlisted military members as low-income households. 

The bill also provides any development within 15 miles of a qualifying military installation with a 30% “basis boost” under Section 42D of the Internal Revenue Code. This would encourage additional new LIHTC development near “Large Site” military bases such as Hill Air Force Base and Joint Base Lewis-McChord. “Large Sites” are defined in the DOD’s Annual Base Structure Report as having a total Plant Replacement Value of greater than $2.833 billion. 

The bill text can be found  here.

She is Whip of the New Democrat Coalition, Secretary of the Congressional Black Caucus, the first African-American to represent Washington State and the Pacific Northwest, and one of the first Korean-American women elected to Congress.

10:39:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.—  Today, Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) released the following statement regarding the California Air Resources Board’s decision to withdraw its Clean Air Act waiver to the EPA for its Advanced Clean Fleet and In-Use Locomotive Regulation rules: 

“This is a rare but welcome move from CARB. Withdrawing these burdensome regulations is a win for our trucking and train industries, which have faced crippling costs and disruptions. The Advanced Clean Fleet and In-Use Locomotive Regulation rules were unrealistic and would have placed unnecessary financial burden on businesses, consumers, and the economy. President Trump has been outspoken against overreach like this, and it’s about time California follows his lead in rethinking its heavy-handed approach. This decision is a step in the right direction, and I hope it signals a shift toward more balanced and responsible policymaking in California,”  said Rep. LaMalfa. 

Congressman Doug LaMalfa is Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus and a lifelong farmer representing California’s First Congressional District, including Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama and Yuba Counties.

This bill allows women and girls a fair playing field in sports by ensuring that school athletics comply with the Title IX recognition of a person’s actual chromosomes and sex at birth: 

“This passage is significant win for fairness and integrity in women’s sports. This bill ensures that female athletes can compete on an even playing field, staying true to the original purpose of the Title IX. Women and girls deserve the chance to succeed in sports based on their own hard work and talent, without facing the unfair challenge of competing against biological males. This legislation stands up for the rights of female athletes, protecting their right to privacy and safety in places like bathrooms and locker rooms, and preserving the principles of competition and fair play that are at the heart of sports. It’s a straightforward matter and we’re pleased to be taking action to protect the future of women’s athletics,”  said Rep. LaMalfa.

10:39:05 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  La presidenta del Subcomité del Hemisferio Occidental, la congresista  María Elvira Salazar (R-FL)  , volvió a presentar la  Ley para Combatir la Opresión hasta que el Reinado de Castro Termine  (link is external)  (FORCE  , por sus siglas en inglés), legislación que impediría que cualquier Administración estadounidense normalice las relaciones con la dictadura cubana hasta que la libertad y la democracia sean restauradas al pueblo cubano. 

Los congresistas Chris Smith (R-NJ), Carlos A. Giménez (R-FL), Keith Self (R-TX), John Rutherford (R-FL), Joe Wilson (R-SC), Michael McCaul (R-TX), Ryan Zinke (R-MT), Cory Mills (R-FL), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), Randy Weber (R-TX), Scott Franklin (R-FL), Ann Wagner (R-MO), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Stephanie Bice (R-OK), Steve Womack (R-AR), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) y Mike Lawler (R-NY) también son copresentadores del proyecto de ley. 

Lamentablemente, la Administración Biden acaba de tomar una acción impensable en apoyo de la dictadura comunista cubana. En respuesta a su vergonzosa decisión de eliminar la designación de Cuba como Estado Patrocinador del Terrorismo, es más vital que nunca asegurarse de que el dictador Miguel Díaz-Canel no cuente con el oxígeno económico necesario para seguir reprimiendo al pueblo cubano antes de la toma de posesión del presidente Trump. 

“  Está claro que con la traición del presidente Biden a la comunidad cubana en la isla y en el exilio, la necesidad de mantener al régimen en la Lista de Patrocinadores del Terrorismo hasta que se restablezca la libertad es más necesaria que nunca  ”,  dijo la congresista Salazar.  “  Me siento orgullosa de reintroducir la Ley FORCE para asegurar que ningún otro presidente pueda violar unilateralmente las políticas establecidas de nuestra nación de una manera tan grotesca  ”. 

La Ley FORCE impide que el régimen comunista cubano sea removido de la Lista de Patrocinadores del Terrorismo hasta que cumpla con los requisitos de la Sección 205 de la Ley LIBERTAD (P.L. 104-114). La Sección 205 de la Ley LIBERTAD requiere que Cuba cumpla con las siguientes condiciones: 

  * Liberar a todos los prisioneros políticos y permitir investigaciones en las cárceles cubanas por organizaciones internacionales de derechos humanos apropiadas. 
  * Hacer una transición del régimen de los Castro a un sistema que garantice los derechos del pueblo cubano a expresarse libremente. 
  * Comprometerse a celebrar elecciones libres y justas. 



Estos son los mismos requisitos que deben cumplirse para levantar el embargo y las sanciones al régimen. En otras palabras, este proyecto de ley obliga al régimen a cumplir con la ley estadounidense vigente.

10:39:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Western Hemisphere Subcommittee Chairwoman  María Elvira Salazar (R-FL)  reintroduced the Fighting Oppression until the Reign of Castro Ends  (FORCE) Act  (link is external)  , legislation that would prevent any U.S. administration from normalizing relations with the Cuban dictatorship until liberty and democracy are restored to the Cuban people. 

Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Carlos A. Giménez (R-FL), Keith Self (R-TX), John Rutherford (R-FL), Joe Wilson (R-SC), Michael McCaul (R-TX), Ryan Zinke (R-MT), Cory Mills (R-FL), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), Randy Weber (R-TX), Scott Franklin (R-FL), Ann Wagner (R-MO), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Stephanie Bice (R-OK), Steve Womack (R-AR), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Mike Lawler (R-NY) also cosponsored the bill. 

Sadly, the Biden Administration just took an unthinkable action in support of the communist Cuban Dictatorship. In response to their shameful decision to remove the State Sponsors of Terrorism designation from the Cuban regime, it is more vital than ever to ensure dictator Miguel Díaz-Canel does not have the economic oxygen he needs to continue repressing the Cuban people ahead of President Trump’s inauguration. 

“  It is clear that with President Biden’s betrayal of the Cuban community on the island and in exile, the need to keep the regime on the State Sponsors of Terrorism List until freedom is restored is more necessary than ever,  ”  said Chairwoman Salazar.  “  I am proud to reintroduce the FORCE Act to ensure no other President can unilaterally violate our nation’s established policies in such a grotesque manner.  ” 

The FORCE Act prevents the Cuban communist regime from being removed from the State Sponsor of Terrorism List until they meet the requirements of Section 205 of the LIBERTAD Act (P.L. 104-114). Section 205 of the LIBERTAD Act requires Cuba to comply with the following conditions: 

  * Release all political prisoners and allow for investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate international human rights organizations. 
  * Transition away from the Castro regime to a system that guarantees the rights of the Cuban people to express themselves freely. 
  * Commit to holding free and fair elections. 



These are the same requirements that must be met to lift the embargo and accompanying sanctions towards the regime. In other words, this bill forces the regime to comply with existing U.S. law.

10:39:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today,  Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03)  ,  Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11)  ,  Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D. (NC-12)  , and  Democratic Women’s Caucus Chair Teresa Leger Fernández (NM-03)  applauded the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights’ newly released  fact sheet  clarifying colleges’ obligation under Title IX to offer equal opportunity to college athletes with respect to publicity, support services, Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) offerings, and direct payments. 

“For over 50 years, Title IX has created the opportunity for countless girls and women to compete in the sports they love and continue their athletic careers in college. As the landscape of college sports evolves, one principle remains unchanged: schools have a clear obligation under Title IX to provide equal opportunities for women and men athletes alike. The Department of Education’s guidance reinforces that commitment and ensures that fairness and equal opportunity remain at the heart of college athletics,”  said Congresswoman Trahan, the only former Division I woman athlete in Congress  . 

“We have an obligation to ensure that our colleges and universities across the country are living up to the promise of Title IX. That’s why I teamed up with Reps. Trahan, Adams, and the Democratic Women’s Caucus to urge the Department of Education to release clear guidance on the obligation of schools to provide equal opportunity for women athletes under the NCAA’s new Name, Image, and Likeness rules. I applaud the Administration’s decision to release this important guidance to support and uplift women’s sports,”  said Congresswoman Sherrill  . 

“I commend Secretary Cardona and the Department of Education for reinforcing schools’ responsibilities to ensure fairness and equity in athletics through Title IX,”  said Congresswoman Adams, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development  . “Equity in sports isn’t just about fairness—it’s about opportunity. This guidance ensures that women athletes receive the resources, support, and visibility they deserve. It reaffirms that Title IX will continue to deliver on its promise, allowing young women and girls to achieve their dreams as sports evolve” 

“Women athletes deserve nothing less than full and fair access to the opportunities, resources, and recognition Title IX guarantees,”  said Democratic Women's Caucus Chair Leger Fernández  . “Title IX has long stood as a pillar of fairness, opening doors for women and girls to thrive in athletics and beyond. That is why members of the DWC have tirelessly worked to make sure Title IX continues to deliver on its promise of equity and opportunity for women in athletics. The new guidance from the Department of Education is a critical step to make sure that as college sports evolve, school policies keep pace.” 

The fact sheet released yesterday came after Trahan, Sherrill, and Adams led a  letter  in November signed by nearly 30 members of the Democratic Women’s Caucus to the U.S. Department of Education requesting clarity on how Title IX applies to college athlete pay. In the letter, the lawmakers asked how Title IX is being considered following preliminary approval of the settlement agreement in  House v. NCAA  ,  Hubbard v. NCAA  , and  Carter v. NCAA  .

10:39:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today,  Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03)  issued the following statement regarding the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas: 

“I welcome the news of the long-sought ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, which will finally halt the devastating bloodshed in Gaza and guarantee the release of dozens of hostages who have endured unimaginable suffering. This breakthrough offers a moment of hope amid 15 months of pain and suffering.” 

“History shows us the power of ceasefires to achieve progress. During the six-day ceasefire in November 2023, a significant number of hostages were released – the only time such progress was made since the horrifying October 7th terrorist attack and the onset of this conflict. This evidence reinforces what many of us have long believed: that ceasefire agreements are the most viable path forward to stop the violence and secure the safe return of those still held captive.” 

“However, this agreement must be more than a pause in fighting. It should mark the beginning of earnest conversations about a permanent end to the war, the return of every remaining hostage, and the charting of a path toward a durable peace.”

You know, the issues that so many people told us mattered most in the ‘24 election,”  Congresswoman Trahan said  . “But instead, in just their second week of power, House Republicans have chosen to vote on a federal takeover of sports at all levels.”

H.R. 28 threatens to revoke federal funding from schools that allow transgender girls and women, including those as young as Kindergarteners, to play sports on girls’ and women’s teams, effectively banning their participation nationwide. The legislation provides no guidance on how to enforce the ban, leaving the door open to requirements that girls “prove” their gender when they are accused of not being girls. 

“The consequences of that approach will be devastating. Girls as young as four years old being subjected to invasive lines of questioning about their bodies and even physical inspections by an adult, a stranger, a predator? All because some creep accuses them of not being a girl,”  Congresswoman Trahan continued  . “What parent would want to put their daughter through that? I know I wouldn’t.” 

The President of the NCAA  testified  in December that fewer than 10 out of the 510,000 active college athletes are transgender, and last year, Republican Utah Governor Spencer Cox  vetoed  a similar state level ban citing the bill’s impact on just 4 out of Utah’s 75,000 high school athletes. H.R. 28 also makes no mention of steps already taken by sports governing bodies to update their rules to ensure fairness and safety in their respective sports. To date, the international authorities overseeing Track and Field, Boxing, Cycling, Swimming, and Rugby have crafted rules governing transgender athlete participation, including during the 2024 Paris Olympics. 

“Madam Speaker, we won’t be able to find common ground on this issue today. But this debate has made one thing abundantly clear: Members of Congress are the last people who should decide who gets to play sports in America,”  Congresswoman Trahan concluded  . “That responsibility belongs where it always has – to the organizations whose mission it is to protect the fairness, the safety, and the integrity of their sports.” 

As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Trahan has championed efforts to strengthen girls’ and women’s sports across all levels of competition. Last February, she  reintroduced  the  Fair Play for Women Act  to close Title IX loopholes that deprive women and girls of athletic opportunities in college and K-12 sports. In November, Trahan led nearly 30 Democratic congresswomen in writing to the U.S. Secretary of Education  requesting clarity  on how Title IX applies to collegiate athlete pay, particularly if a federal judge approves the proposed settlement in the  House, Hubbard, and Carter v. NCAA  court cases.

Remarks as Delivered 

Floor Speech Opposing H.R. 28 

January 14, 2025 

Madam Speaker, House Republicans have a big vote planned for today. Now, I wish I was talking about a bill that will lower costs for hardworking families or help more Americans buy a home. You know, the issues that so many people told us mattered most in the ‘24 election. But instead, in just their second week of power, House Republicans have chosen to vote on a federal takeover of sports at all levels. 

To justify this power grab, my colleagues across the aisle are preying on the legitimate concerns that some people have about transgender athletes in women’s sports. For the vast majority of those folks, many of them parents, their concerns don’t come from a place of hate. They come from a place of worry about the safety of their daughters and the fairness of their sport. 

Now, as the only woman in Congress who played Division I sports in college, I know how critical it is that we ensure that sports are safe and fair above all else. It’s all any athlete wants – to know that if they put in the hard work and the training necessary, they’re going to have a fair shot on game day. And as the mom of two young daughters who I cheer on from the bleachers every weekend, I know that parents want their kids to be able to enjoy the game they love. 

After all, we know how important sports can be to children’s development. They give the chance to build confidence, learn teamwork, and develop lifelong friendships. That’s why, like parents and athletes across our country, I have long placed my trust in the governing bodies of sports – the experts who have dedicated their lives to these games – to create fair and responsible rules for participation. 

And despite what the authors of this legislation have said, many of those organizations have already updated their rules to ensure fairness and safety in their sports. That includes the international authorities overseeing Track and Field, Boxing, Cycling, Swimming, Rugby, just to name a few. These organizations – many led by former athletes – worked with scientists, athletic federations, human rights organizations to craft thoughtful, evidence-based rules, including those governing participation in the Paris Olympics last summer. 

Don’t get me wrong, Madam Speaker – I recognize that there’s more work to be done. But why in the world would we let insincere, attention-seeking politicians here in Washington, many of whom know little to nothing about competitive sports, take over? It doesn’t make any sense. However, that’s exactly what my Republican colleagues are going to do today – inject themselves into decisions they have no business making. 

In fact, if you listen to them, they would have you think that a transgender woman in college who may have transitioned after puberty and may present physical advantages over her opponent is the same as a ten-year-old girl who just wants to play soccer on the weekends with her friends. But those two situations aren’t the same at all, and the consequences of that approach will be devastating. Girls as young as four years old being subjected to invasive lines of questioning about their bodies and even physical inspections by an adult, a stranger, a predator? All because some creep accuses them of not being a girl. 

What parent would want to put their daughter through that? I know I wouldn’t. 

Madam Speaker, we won’t be able to find common ground on this issue today. But this debate has made one thing abundantly clear: Members of Congress are the last people who should decide who gets to play sports in America. That responsibility belongs where it always has – to the organizations whose mission it is to protect the fairness, the safety, and the integrity of their sports. 

I urge my colleagues to vote no on the GOP’s Child Predator Empowerment Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.

10:39:11 root         DEBUG    Titles: MACOM Signs Preliminary Memorandum of Terms for Up to $70 Million in CHIPS and Science Act Funding
10:39:11 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:39:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today,  Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03)  applauded the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  signing  of a preliminary memorandum of terms with MACOM Technology Solutions Inc. (MACOM) to provide up to $70 million in funding from the  CHIPS and Science Act  to support the expansion and modernization of MACOM’s facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts and Durham, North Carolina. The project would create up to 350 manufacturing jobs and up to an additional 60 construction jobs across both states. 

“I’m proud to help secure this historic federal investment through the CHIPS and Science Act to expand and modernize MACOM’s Lowell Headquarters,”  said Congresswoman Trahan  . “This funding will boost MACOM’s work to create good-paying jobs focused on researching, developing, and manufacturing the specialized semiconductors that keep us connected and are essential to defending our national security.” 

“Today’s announcement with MACOM is another example of how CHIPS for America is making targeted and strategic proposed investments across the semiconductor industry,”  said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo  . “As a result of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, we are strengthening U.S. supply chain security and advancing our technological leadership of the 21st century.” 

“We appreciate all of the support we received from our Federal representatives, as well as Local and State leadership,”  said MACOM President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen G. Daly  . “We expect to increase MACOM’s manufacturing production capabilities on critical semiconductor technologies used for National Security. We look forward to finalizing these plans and to generating additional employment opportunities in the great City of Lowell.” 

Headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts, MACOM is a developer and manufacturer of a wide range of semiconductor components for the commercial and defense sectors and supplies industrial, defense, datacenter, and telecommunication customers. The company has been heralded as a model U.S. producer of highly advanced semiconductor products key to reducing dependence on materials and products sourced from foreign nations. The dependence on a foreign supply chain of semiconductors was a  key inflationary pressure  that drove up prices for consumers during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The proposed investment announced today was made possible by the  CHIPS and Science Act  , which Congresswoman Trahan  supported passage of in July 2022  to target root causes of inflation, create good-paying jobs, and strengthen national security. Earlier this year, Trahan  wrote  to the U.S. Department of Commerce in support of MACOM’s application for this award.

10:39:21 root         DEBUG    Desc:   
Washington, DC —  This week, Congressman Jerry Nadler (NY-12) was named the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust for the 119th Congress. 

As the former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a pivotal role in advancing legislative efforts to rein in corporate consolidation and released a comprehensive report on antitrust titled, “Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets,” which helped drive the Federal Trade Commission’s work under the Biden Administration. 

“Under the Biden Administration, we saw more progress on antitrust enforcement than we have in decades,"  said Subcommittee Ranking Member Nadler.  "We already know Donald Trump seeks to roll back this progress and prioritize the needs of his billionaire friends’ over working families’. I look forward to continuing my work fighting to preserve economic fairness and safeguard the interests of everyday Americans. I am grateful to have earned the support of my colleagues to stand as a bulwark against Trump’s dangerous agenda that will put big business first.” 

The Subcommittee’s jurisdiction includes bankruptcy and commercial law, bankruptcy judgeships, administrative law, independent counsel, state taxation affecting interstate commerce, interstate compacts and antitrust matters.

10:39:22 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:39:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the most senior Jewish Member of the House of Representatives, issued the following statement regarding the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza: 

“I welcome the news of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and deeply thank President Biden and his administration for their tireless efforts to reach this point. As President Biden pointed out, it is noteworthy that the same plan that President Biden outlined publicly in May served as the blueprint for this agreement. It is clear that without his efforts, this agreement would not have been possible. Indeed, President Biden will leave office with a transformed Middle East: Syria has been liberated from the tyrannical grip of Bashar al-Assad, the presidency in Lebanon freed from Hezbollah’s control, and a landmark ceasefire agreement in Gaza. 

“While the news of a ceasefire agreement in Gaza is unquestionably a critically important positive step, we must also recognize that many crucial issues remain to be resolved in the agreed upon framework. We must ensure that all the hostages return home, that there is a true cessation of hostilities, that sufficient humanitarian assistance is surged to the people of Gaza, the return of the displaced to their homes in both southern Israel and Gaza, and achievement of long-term stability for all in the region. These are necessary steps in pursuit of a larger lasting peace, achievable only through a negotiated two-state solution. 

“The news of this agreement also provides an opportunity to reflect on the period since October 7th, the deadliest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust. The past 15 months have been excruciating for many. As a Zionist and a deeply committed Jew, the events of October 7th and the ensuing war has never been far from my mind. I have mourned for the innocent lives lost, the dire conditions for civilians in Gaza, and the families uprooted from their homes. My prayer is that today’s announcement is a beginning of a new period—one that realizes the vision articulated in the book of Isiah, that “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.”

10:39:22 root         DEBUG    Titles: Nadler, Lawler Show Bipartisan Support for Additional Israeli Airlines Bid to Fly Direct NYC-TLV and Bring Costs Down for Constituents
10:39:22 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:39:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Mike Lawler led Greater New York City Area Representatives Clarke, Gillen, Goldman, Gottheimer, Kean, LaLota, Latimer, Meeks, Menendez, Meng, Pou, Sherrill, Suozzi, and Torres in a bipartisan letter to the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration supporting the expedited review and fair consideration of additional Israeli airlines’ bid to fly directly between New York City area airports and Tel Aviv. 

The current situation of only one airline flying directly between the Greater New York City area and Israel has led to record-high prices for our constituents and record-high profits for El Al. For example, The Israeli news outlet  Ynet  reported  in March of 2024 that “Flights to the U.S. during the Passover holiday are currently sold upward of $2,930 for a [roundtrip] flight.” Additionally, the Times of Israel recently  reported  that El Al profits rose nearly 260% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a year earlier. 

The members write: “While our strong preference would be for U.S. carriers to resume their service from the greater New York City area airports that serve our districts, unfortunately, these airlines continue to extend suspensions of their service to TLV. In the absence of U.S. carriers flying this critical route for our constituents, we strongly support additional Israeli carriers providing service between these two deeply connected communities to provide competition and lower customer prices.” 

The members continue: “We believe that there must be competition between airlines in the greater New York City area and the Tel Aviv market in order to ensure American consumers and their loved ones are not price gouged in this time of war. Crucial to that effort is your expedited consideration of any application that may come before you from an Israeli airline, especially for low-cost direct service between the greater New York area and Tel Aviv. Ensuring that such service is able to begin swiftly will provide a much-needed additional link between our communities and Israel, when such a connection is more critical than ever to many of our constituents.” 

The current situation is significantly impacting many families in our districts’ financial abilities to be together with loved ones in this difficult time of war. The members urged the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration to prioritize granting approval for more Israeli airlines to fly directly to the greater New York City area from Tel Aviv, in order to increase competition and bring down prices for their constituents as soon as possible.

10:39:25 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:39:25 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher (TX-07) announced that her office has successfully resolved more than 15,000 matters for residents of Texas’ Seventh Congressional District. Her office assists residents with matters before federal agencies, including obtaining benefits from Social Security, Medicare, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as addressing matters before the Small Business Administration, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Internal Revenue Service, and others. 

“Every day, our team of constituent advocates works to serve our constituents on matters of all kinds, helping those seeking assistance with federal agencies,” said  Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher  . “I am grateful to the residents of Texas’ Seventh Congressional District who have put their trust in me and my team to help resolve some of their most pressing problems. I am proud of our team, and I look forward to continuing to serve our neighbors and helping our community in every way we can.” 

Below are some testimonials from constituents Congresswoman Fletcher and her team have helped: 

Social Security Administration 

“My wife sadly passed away earlier this year, and I attempted to collect her Social Security benefits. I provided all the necessary paperwork to the SSA, but instead encountered poor communication, lost paperwork, and endless (and unjustified) roadblocks for denying benefits. Between the grieving and the mounting financial pressure, I had almost given up hope until I reached out to the Office of Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher. Congresswoman Fletcher’s Office successfully secured Social Security benefits (plus back pay) in less than a month after our initial contact. 

“I cannot begin to my express my gratitude and admiration for what was accomplished. I would not have been able to receive my wife’s benefits without Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher. A special shout out to [Constituent Advocate] Sara who was our initial point of contact with the Office of Congresswoman Fletcher.” 

\- Oscar B. 

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services 

“I applied for Concurrent filing of I-765 and I-131. My I-765 was approved and when contacted USCIS for I-131 they asked me to wait. My case was not expedited initially even after submitting a doctor's letter and my flight ticket. But I needed to travel to India for my mother's injury and she needed some support to do her daily activities. Then I approached Congresswoman Fletcher's office for help to expedite my case. [Senior Constituent Advocate] Fatimah reached out to USCIS and on their side, I opened an expedited request again in my.uscis.gov and reuploaded an updated travel ticket along with a few other documents to prove my relationship with my mother. As my case was supported by the Congresswoman's office, my case was expedited and got approved. 

“I will be traveling to India to support my mother as planned this time. This is a big hassle for Legal Immigrants who have been in USA for more than 15 plus years and have to wait for approval to travel. Thanks to the Congresswoman's office for support.” 

\- Venkata P. 

United States Department of State 

“I contacted Congresswoman Fletcher’s office because I ordered my daughters’ passports in May, and in August, we still hadn’t received anything. We were supposed to travel on August 14. Had to change my travel date. I called multiple times for an update on where her passport was. Paid for expedited and I kept getting “it’s in progress.” It was in-progress since MAY! I sent out an email late August 12 to the Congresswoman. August 13 the Congresswoman’s team reached out to me, and I filled out the paperwork required. August 14 I got an email notification that the passport has been approved and now shipped and will be here by Aug 17! I am forever grateful! I was super stressed out, but they have eased that.”

10:39:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON D.C.  – House Appropriations Committee Vice Chair and Chairman of the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK), and Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Robert Aderholt (R-AL) released the below statement regarding the Biden Administration’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to perform abortions within the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program: 

The lawmakers said  , “American values and law dictate a zero-tolerance policy for the funding of abortions through federal taxpayer dollars. We are outraged to learn this standard has been violated under the non-watchful eye of the Biden Administration, only notifying Congress on their way out the door. PEPFAR has saved the lives of millions of innocent people and strengthened global health for decades. Its intent is to protect lives - not terminate them. This disgraceful perversion of a successful and bipartisan initiative demands stringent accountability. We demand a thorough investigation and dismissal of any official found to have taken part in this egregious violation. Whether malicious intent or extreme negligence, this can never be allowed to happen again. Disregard for compliance or oversight will not be tolerated. Life must be protected - we will not stand down on this matter.” 

U.S. officials have  reported  (link is external)  that CDC-funded nurses in Mozambique have been conducting abortions since as early as 2021, utilizing PEPFAR funds meant to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide. Under the Biden Administration’s watch, this is the first documented violation of U.S. law prohibiting funds for abortion since the program was created in 2003. Pro-life protections are a priority for Republican appropriators. The House FY24 and FY25 SFOPS reports included language requiring strengthened oversight and rigorous monitoring.

El legislador Díaz-Balart declaró  : “Estoy profundamente honrado de continuar como presidente de este subcomité y agradezco al presidente del Comité de Asignaciones, Tom Cole, por su excepcional liderazgo, invaluable orientación y apoyo inquebrantable. 

Como presidente del subcomité que determina los fondos para la política exterior de EE.UU., me enorgullece que las leyes para los años fiscales 2024 y 2025 defienden los valores y prioridades claves de EE.UU. protegiendo al mismo tiempo los dólares de los contribuyentes americanos al reducir significativamente el gasto innecesario. 

Me complace mucho que la legislación de financiamiento para el año fiscal 2024 –que ya es Ley– haya logrado el mayor recorte de financiamiento de todos los proyectos de ley, comparado con los niveles de gasto de 2023, alcanzando una reducción del seis por ciento, el mas grande en los últimos años. El proyecto de ley de financiamiento para el año fiscal 2025 recorta aún más, un 11% por debajo de los niveles de gasto del año fiscal 2024. 

Lo crucial es que estas leyes restablecen el liderazgo americano que ha estado gravemente ausente bajo la Administración Biden-Harris durante los últimos cuatro años. Estas leyes promueven la libertad, manifiestan una fuerte solidaridad con nuestros aliados y se mantienen firmes contra las fuerzas malignas que amenazan la seguridad nacional de EE.UU. Cuando el presidente Trump asuma el cargo heredará varias crisis globales exacerbadas por las desastrosas políticas de la administración Biden-Harris, incluida la guerra en Ucrania y los terroristas envalentonados en el Medio Oriente. 

Espero con entusiasmo trabajar con el presidente Trump y su equipo de política exterior, y sigo comprometido con priorizar agencias y programas que protegen nuestra seguridad nacional, apoyan a nuestros aliados, enfrentan a adversarios y promueven la democracia y la libertad”.

Rep. Díaz-Balart said  : “I am deeply honored to continue serving as Chairman of this subcommittee, and I am tremendously grateful to Chairman Tom Cole for his exceptional leadership, invaluable guidance, and unwavering support. 

"As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities, I am proud of the State and Foreign Operations bills for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, which uphold key U.S. values and priorities while saving taxpayer dollars and eliminating wasteful spending. 

“The National Security and Department of State funding bill for fiscal year 2024 –which is now law– achieved the largest year-to-year funding cut out of all bills when compared to 2023 spending levels, achieving a six percent cut, the largest in recent memory. The fiscal year 2025 funding bill cuts funding a further 11% below 2024 levels. 

“More importantly, these bills reestablish American leadership, which has been severely lacking under the Biden-Harris Administration for the past four years. These bills advance freedom, manifest strong solidarity with our allies, and stand firm against the malign forces threatening U.S. national security. As President Trump takes office, he will inherit a number of global crises exacerbated by the reckless policies of the Biden-Harris Administration, including the war in Ukraine and emboldened terrorists in the Middle East. 

“I look forward to working with President Trump and his foreign policy team, and I remain committed to strengthening our national defense, supporting our allies, standing up to our enemies, and promoting democracy and human rights worldwide.” 

Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole said  : 

“Under the direction of Chairman Díaz-Balart, our National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs appropriations legislation has reflected America’s commitment to our core values of freedom and democracy, not only for ourselves, but for all of humanity. These bills take critical steps toward ensuring Americans are safe at home and abroad, prioritizing U.S. security while reducing excessive spending. They also command American excellence by countering the destabilizing actions of Hamas terrorists, Communist China, and the growing challenges of evil authoritarian regimes. I am deeply proud of the work we have done on these bills and applaud Chairman Díaz-Balart’s hard work. I look forward to continuing our efforts to protect American interests and taxpayers.”

10:39:39 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congresswoman Dina Titus announced today her selection as Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. In this position, she will lead her Democratic colleagues in their oversight of the nation’s rail system, including Amtrak and the Brightline West high-speed rail project which she championed after decades of advocacy. 

“I am honored to be chosen by my Democratic colleagues to lead them in their efforts to enhance the safety and efficient movement of goods on our railroads, including the 1,193 miles that run through Nevada, expand opportunities for high-speed rail, and to ensure the wellbeing of the more than 120,000 rail workers who keep the Las Vegas Valley and our country moving every day,” Congresswoman Titus said.   
  
“Rep. Dina Titus will be an outstanding Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials in the 119th Congress, and her appointment is a testament to her exceptional capabilities and dynamic leadership. Collaborating closely with Ranking Member Rick Larsen and the entire Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Rep. Titus will address critical challenges and advance meaningful initiatives for the American people. I look forward to witnessing all she will achieve in this role,” said Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse. 

Background 

The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials has jurisdiction over the economic and safety regulation of railroads, and the agencies that administer those regulations. Economic regulation is administered by the five-member Surface Transportation Board (STB). 

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for administering and overseeing railroad safety laws, railroad infrastructure and development programs, performing research and developing technology, and has federal oversight of Amtrak. 

The Subcommittee also has jurisdiction over the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration which is responsible for providing regulations and safety oversight of pipelines and pipeline facilities, as well as overseeing the transportation of hazardous materials. 

Railroad retirement benefits and unemployment systems as well as rail labor relations also fall under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. 

Rep. Titus was also selected to serve on the following Subcommittees: 

  * Highways and Transit, which will oversee the next reauthorization of surface transportation programs. 
  * Aviation 
  * Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management

Titus said. “We must codify this opposition into law to protect the health and safety of our communities and guarantee a process that requires the consent of state, local, and tribal leaders. Nevada is not a nuclear waste land. We don’t produce nuclear waste, and we shouldn’t be forced to store it.”   
  
“I’ve said for years that Washington shouldn’t have the unilateral authority to make decisions that will impact communities and the environment in the Silver State for generations to come,” said Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. “Nevadans have made it clear, Yucca Mountain is dead. This legislation will give local and Tribal leaders the seat at the table they deserve in decision-making about nuclear repositories in their communities – in Nevada and across the country. I will continue to fight to make sure Nevadans’ voices are heard.”   
  
“Nevadans have been overwhelmingly clear in their opposition to making Nevada the nation’s nuclear waste dumping ground,” said Senator Jacky Rosen. “This legislation will ensure that states like Nevada have a say in opposing the storage of nuclear waste in their backyard. I’ll always fight against Washington’s efforts to bring nuclear waste to our state.”   
  
“Nevadans will not stand by at attempts to make our state a nuclear dumping ground,” Rep. Steven Horsford said. “Our public health is on the line; our environmental safety is on the line; our ability to feel secure in our communities is on the line – so our voices will not be silenced. I’m proud to cosponsor the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act to require local consent for any attempt to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, and I will always work to prevent this ill-conceived project from moving forward.”   
  
“Nevada has made it clear for decades that we refuse to become the nation’s nuclear dumping ground,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “This bill ensures that nuclear waste projects, like Yucca Mountain, cannot move forward without consent from the communities they affect. I’ll continue fighting against attempts to revive Yucca Mountain.”   
  
Congresswoman Titus’s long track record of elevating Nevadans’ voices in consent-based siting for nuclear waste and toxic material dates back to 2015 when she first introduced the consent-based legislation. She has introduced similar legislation in every congressional session since. Her efforts also include supporting funding for the Office of Nuclear Energy that advances the goals of the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act.   
  
Congresswoman Titus also has worked with the State of Nevada’s Agency for Nuclear Projects to urge the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to consider Nevada’s motion to reopen the licensing proceeding regarding Yucca Mountain so that a vote to suspend the project could be taken.   
  
Congresswoman Titus’s bicameral Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act is based on the 2012 recommendations of the Department of Energy’s Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America’s Nuclear Future and that Department’s consent-based siting report from 2017. The legislation would allow funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund to be used for construction of a nuclear waste repository only if the Secretary of Energy secured written consent from: 

  * The Governor of the host state 
  * Affected units of local government 
  * Each contiguous unit of local government primarily affected by the repository 
  * Affected Indian tribes

“I am encouraged that the Israeli cabinet has approved the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, paving the way for the safe return of the remaining hostages taken on October 7. Every effort must be made to reunite these individuals with their families and ensure their well-being after over a year of unimaginable suffering. I have long supported an immediate ceasefire to end hostilities, bring hostages home, and pave the way for a two-state solution. 

“At the same time, this agreement brings an opportunity to dramatically increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been devastated by this conflict. Over two million people, many of them children, are facing dire shortages of food, water, and medical supplies. Hospitals are near collapse, and entire communities have been reduced to rubble. Without swift and substantial humanitarian aid, the suffering of Palestinians will only be prolonged, preventing progress toward long-term regional stability. 

“Never forget that this war began because of Hamas’ attack on October 7  th  . Hamas is a terrorist organization that cannot play any role in going forward. 

“This destructive war has caused incalculable loss on both sides. I am relieved it is finally nearing an end, which will enable civilians on both sides to resume their lives, and for the rebuilding of Gaza to begin. This process must be seen through to the end.”

By Rosa DeLauro | Congresswoman for Connecticut’s Third District 

When I was growing up, my mother always told me two things: never give up, and never take no for an answer. 

I rely on that advice every day. There is no better example of this than the state block grants for disaster relief that I included in the recently passed disaster supplemental funding bill, in order to help small and medium sized farmers. From the very beginning, this program was made possible by the determination and advocacy of Connecticut farmers. 

The need for this program is illustrated by the story of farmers like Will DellaCamera. Will owns and operates  Ceccarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm  (link is external)  in Northford, with 140 acres of specialty crops, including corn, tomatoes, squash, and more. His story is just one of many across New England encapsulating this problem. 

On a Monday afternoon last spring, a highly localized hailstorm with golf-ball sized ice chunks struck Will’s farm. In fewer than 15 minutes, nearly the entire crop was destroyed, causing losses of over $400,000. Will’s season was over before it could even begin. 

Will knew the  risks faced by so many small and specialty farmers across the country  (link is external)  , which have difficulty getting crop insurance due to limited coverage options for diverse crops. Will had some crop insurance and also applied for the  Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program  (link is external)  , or NAP, despite the high cost of this financial assistance, to try to protect himself. Following this disaster, he received barely $150,000—less than half of what he lost. Since the storm was so localized, he also could not receive support from federal agencies, which require  a national federal disaster declaration to provide aid.  (link is external) 

This disaster may have been considered small by the federal government, but it  was devastating for Will  (link is external)  , who lost a year’s worth of effort and income, and his local community. And he is not alone. Other Connecticut and New England farmers have suffered disasters like this in the last two years, and many residents who had their farms damaged by flooding last year can also tell stories about the difficulty they faced in getting help. These farmers are slipping through the cracks in our federal farm safety net. 

This is one of the primary reasons that Connecticut has lost 460 farms over the last five years. We are leaving farmers high and dry when disaster strikes. 

Will knew that was not right. He told his story and the stories of farmers across our state and region. 

Will also went the extra mile—literally. He drove his tractor down to D.C. to raise awareness, meeting with other farmers all along the way, who shared their stories and concerns with messages written on the side of his trailer, until he got to the National Mall. 

I met with Will the next morning in my office with the Connecticut delegation and went out with him in the pouring rain on the Mall to see his tractor. He was passionate but understanding, and he was concerned not just for himself, but for farmers across the country who face the same lack of support. I knew we needed to take action. 

With input from farmers, my colleagues, and policy experts, I drafted a historic new block grant that is tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized farmers. It allows farmers without crop insurance to receive disaster relief, opening the door for so many specialty crop producers left behind by our current farm safety net. It also permits states to determine how extreme weather events have affected their communities, affording them more flexibility, and provides $220,000,000 in funding for farmers who experienced such a disaster from 2023 to 2024. 

This funding was included in the disaster supplemental bill passed at the end of last year. This will address disasters from the last two years, but I am also working on a long-term solution with the Save our Small Farms Act, alongside the rest of the Connecticut Congressional delegation. The SOS Farms Act takes aims to expand insurance coverage for small and medium-sized farms by reducing paperwork requirements, lowering the cost of coverage, providing revenue protection for diverse crops, and ensuring timely insurance payouts after a disaster. 

These days, many people feel like government does not listen to them. In too many cases, they are right, and as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, I am working hard to make government more responsive by making sure our agencies have enough funding and staff to meet Americans’ needs. 

I also believe this story of small farm disaster relief is a story about how government should work. Citizens should be able to bring their problems to their elected representatives and see quick action to respond. Will may have gone the extra mile, but you should not have to drive a tractor to the National Mall to get attention. People everywhere should be able to pick up the phone and work with their representative. I will strive to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy, and working with constituents to create new ways of getting things done will always remain a priority. Despite its flaws, Congress is still an institution that can and should respond to external pressure.

10:39:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Connecticut’s Congressional Delegation urged farmers in Connecticut to report losses from extreme weathers events in 2023 and 2024 to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture (CT DoAg). Farmers can report losses  here  (link is external)  . 

The  Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant  , created by Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) and championed by Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, provides $220 million to states in New England, Alaska, and Hawaii to help small and medium-sized farmers receive agricultural relief or aid for losses they experienced in 2023 and 2024 from any weather event. This block grant is historic disaster aid for farmers in that it does not require having crop insurance or a national disaster declaration to receive aid. This ensures that farmers left out of our farm safety net and those who suffer losses due to an extreme and localized weather event are not left with no ability to recoup their losses. 

"We strongly encourage farmers in Connecticut to participate in the CT DoAg survey on weather-related losses from 2023 and 2024,”  the delegation said.  “This is a critical opportunity to ensure your needs are accounted for as the state prepares to distribute disaster funding for farmers. The Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant provided $220 million in disaster relief funding for farmers impacted by extreme weather events in 2023 and 2024 and is intended to help affected farmers recoup their losses from these unexpected disasters. Farmers sharing the challenges they faced—whether it’s production losses, infrastructure damage, or increased costs due to invasive species—can help CT DoAg understand the scope of the need to address it as best as they can as soon as funding is ready. Please fill out the survey if you experienced these losses – help will soon be available.” 

The survey will help the CT DoAg collect information from farmers regarding weather-related losses incurred in 2024 and 2024, as well as losses related to long-term stresses worsened by weather conditions during these two years. The data will help CT DoAg fully understand the scope of the losses so they can quickly divide and disburse funding when it is available.  The deadline to complete the survey is Sunday, January 19, 2025.

10:39:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: You can read Rep. Bergman's interview  here  or below:   
  
Alpena  \- U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Watersmeet, said lawmakers in Washington need to use common sense to find common ground for the common good of all.   
  
He said creating and passing good legislation that both Republicans and moderate Democrats can agree on is key to getting things done.   
  
Bergman said since President-elect Donald Trump handily defeated Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in November, the mood in the U.S. House of Representatives has changed. He said many representatives are eager to get to work but also understand the Republicans hold a very small majority, so crafting common sense policy is key to getting things passed.   
  
“I would say the mood here now, at least with Republicans, is they are excitedly optimistic,” Bergman said. “There is some concern because of the small majority, but we know any legislation we create can’t have any Republican members vote against it. Voters nationwide have given us an opportunity and we have to capitalize on the opportunity. Our goal is to make good, moderate bills that everyone — no matter the party — can get behind.”   
  
Bergman served during Trump’s first term. He said he believes the former president can hit the ground running, with the help of Congress, to move his platform forward. He said he also believes Trump learned a lot during his first term and that will make his transition and ability to work with Congress, and all of the other players in the nation’s capital, easier.   
  
“To President Trump’s credit, he acknowledges he knows now what worked and what didn’t,” Bergman said. “I think there will be a lot of work done to remove the roadblocks.”   
  
Still, Bergman said, there will be times when some legislation may be difficult to pass. He said many elected officials worry too much about reelection instead of passing good bills that the party may not approve of.   
  
“People vote for fear of not being reelected and are scared to make certain decisions,” he said.   
  
“We need to get to the point where we worry more about the American people and less about what parties think and how a vote can impact the chances of reelection.”   
  
During Trump’s time in the White House, Bergman proved he has the ability to pick the president’s brain and communicate with him.   
  
After several rallies and visits in Michigan, Bergman joined Trump in the presidential limousine or on Air Force One where they talked about issues in Northern Michigan, including the need to build a new Sault Lock. In 2019, Trump approved $75.3 million in funding toward the design and construction of a new lock, and the construction of it is ongoing. Bergman said Trump was also eager to know more about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and other matters pertaining to the Great Lakes and their health.   
  
Bergman said Trump is always inquisitive about issues in Michigan and eager to learn more about them, so solutions can be considered.   
  
Bergman said Trump had questions about Asian carp, asking what the ramifications could be if they were to begin breeding in the Great Lakes. He said Trump knew a little about the issue, but wanted more detail about where the fish came from, how they got into the Mississippi River, and what could be done to protect the lakes without damaging commerce and shipping.   
  
Bergman said being able to have the ear of the president is good for not only the residents and businesses in his district, but statewide and he will continue to work and communicate with the incoming president to help the residents, businesses, and natural resources in Northern Michigan.

10:39:51 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:39:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01) announced that 15 additional prescription drugs have been selected by the Biden administration for Medicare price negotiations. This is the second round of negotiations authorized by Democrats’ signature Inflation Reduction Act, which is designed to lower costs for seniors and families. 

Negotiations with participating drug companies for these 15 drugs will occur in 2025 and negotiated prices will become effective in 2027. Between November 2023 and October 2024, about 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these 15 drugs to treat conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. 

“Washington seniors need relief at the pharmacy counter and the Inflation Reduction Act is focused on reducing prices on some of the most commonly needed prescriptions they use. This second round of negotiations shows that the law will continue to deliver relief for one of the biggest expenses for Medicare patients long into the future. I commend President Biden for continuing to lead on this effort and I will remain focused on reducing prices for seniors and families moving forward,”  said DelBene  . 

In the first cycle of negotiations, Medicare negotiated with the participating drug manufacturers and reached an agreement on new, lower prices for all 10 drugs that were selected, slashing the price of some of them by 40 to 80 percent. Those prices will become effective starting January 1, 2026. If the new prices had been in effect in 2023, they would have saved $6 billion in prescription drug costs. 

Other cost-saving provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act include a $35 monthly cap on insulin, a $2,000 annual cap on prescription drugs, free vaccines for seniors, and reduced health insurance premiums for people enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.

10:39:52 root         DEBUG    Titles: DelBene, Beyer Introduce Legislation to Block President from Imposing Unchecked Tariffs
10:39:52 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:39:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Representatives Suzan DelBene (WA-01) and Don Beyer (VA-08) led 11 House members in introducing the Prevent Tariff Abuse Act, legislation to stop the President of the United States from imposing import tariffs  under the guise of a national emergency  without Congressional approval. 

Tariffs are taxes paid by importers that are often passed along to consumers through higher prices. Donald Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail and during the presidential transition that he would impose sweeping  tariffs of 10-20% on all imported goods  into the U.S., against some of our largest trading partners including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. Tariffs like the ones Trump is proposing are estimated to directly raise prices on consumer goods by  $2,600  to  $4,000  a year for the average American family – at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy counter. Canada, our largest trading partner, has announced that it is currently  preparing to retaliate  against U.S. companies and their workers if these tariffs are put in place, an example of how countries will respond to Trump’s tariff-first trade agenda. 

The president has the authority to declare emergencies in response to national security or economic threats under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The law was intended to allow presidents to impose financial sanctions on hostile foreign nations that pose an emergency threat to the nation. It was never intended to allow a president to  declare a state of national economic emergency  and impose tariffs on allies. 

“The American people have clearly and consistently said that the high cost of living is one of their top concerns. Imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods would raise prices on consumer products by thousands of dollars a year. Not only would widespread tariffs drive up costs at home and likely send our economy into recession, but they would likely lead to significant retaliation, hurting American workers, farmers, and businesses. This is especially true in Washington where 4-in-10 jobs are trade-dependent,”  said DelBene  . “The law was never intended to be abused in this way. This legislation would ensure that Congress can prevent overly broad emergency powers and establish critical oversight to prevent any president from arbitrarily imposing tariffs that increase costs for Americans.” 

“I have warned during both Democratic and Republican administrations that Congress has ceded far too much authority to the Executive Branch to unilaterally raise tariffs, but Donald Trump’s willingness to abuse those authorities poses particular risk of chaos and damage to the U.S. economy,”  said Beyer  . “Trump’s tariff proposals would misuse emergency authorities to raise prices on the American people, which is unacceptable. Congress must put its foot down and restore the balance of powers that our Founders intended for our trade policy, which is exactly what our bill would do.” 

The Constitution clearly states that “Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties … and to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and no president, Democrat or Republican, should have the power to raise taxes on the American people without the consent of Congress. DelBene’s bill would clarify that the imposition of duties or quotas on the importation of goods is prohibited under IEEPA. 

DelBene and Beyer are joined by Representatives Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Brad Schneider (IL-10), Judy Chu (CA-28), John Larson (CT-01), Terri Sewell (AL-07), Andrea Salinas (OR-06), Rick Larsen (WA-02), Tim Kennedy (NY-26), and Steven Horsford (NV-11).

10:39:52 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:39:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01) released the following statement after the House of Representatives passed the United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act (H.R. 33). 

“Taiwan is one of our strongest allies and top trading partners in the Indo-Pacific region. This legislation will help strengthen the Taiwanese economy in the face of growing threats from China. It will also support American jobs and innovation by reducing double taxation on Taiwanese business investments in the United States. By advancing legislation instead of relying on executive action, the House underscored its durable and lasting commitment to the United States-Taiwan partnership. Swift passage of this legislation shows that when Congress chooses to work in a bipartisan way, we can strengthen America’s economy and global standing.” 

Background 

  * In May 2023, DelBene  introduced  a resolution calling for the end of double taxation between Taiwan and the United States. 
  * DelBene is a cosponsor of the United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act. 
  * In January 2024, DelBene  supported  a bipartisan tax package in the Ways & Means Committee that included this provision. 
  * Later that month, DelBene  voted for  the package on the House floor.

10:39:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, Representative Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) was named to the House Armed Services Committee for the fourth consecutive time since joining Congress and became the first female veteran to be the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel. Houlahan was also named to the Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation (CITI) subcommittee. Houlahan was also appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence by House Leadership. 

“I am honored to be named the Ranking Member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee because our work focuses on the very heart of the U.S. military—the people who raise their hands to serve and the families who support them,”  said Houlahan  . "As a veteran, daughter and granddaughter to servicemen, I know personally the challenges our men and women in uniform and their families face. It is our responsibility to prioritize and improve the quality of their lives which in turn helps us address the urgent recruitment and retention issues we are facing across branches.” 

The Military Personnel Subcommittee oversees Department of Defense (DoD) policies, programs, and accounts related to military personnel and their families. Houlahan has been on this subcommittee since the 117th Congress. In that time, more than 60 of her recommendations on compensation, health care, childcare, housing, support services for military spouses, workforce development, transition assistance, and talent recruitment and retention have been included in the National Defense Authorization Act, which annually funds the United States military. 

As a member of the CITI subcommittee, Houlahan and her colleagues will oversee and handle all Department of Defense policies related to cyber security, including artificial intelligence, cyber force and operations, new technology, computer software, and the weapons of tomorrow. In past Congressional terms, Houlahan has led efforts, to improve the American cyber workforce through legislation and has been an advocate for other cyber efforts including a digital services academy. 

Houlahan added, “Now more than ever, our servicemen and women need to know they can count on the House Armed Services Committee members to protect them while they protect us.”

10:39:58 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:39:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC –  Today, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) released the following statement upon news that a hostage release and ceasefire agreement had been agreed to between Israel and Hamas. 

“On January 15th, negotiators for Hamas and Israel reached a ceasefire agreement to bring peace to Gaza for the first time since 2023. Today Israel voted to officially proceed with the agreement which begins with a 6-week ceasefire to take effect on Sunday, January 19th. During this ceasefire Hamas and Israel will explore a permanent truce and lasting security for Israel and the people of Gaza. 

“Real peace is now within reach. 

“With wise committed political leaders, nations can flourish. But for 467 days since the bloody massacre by Hamas on Israel, dozens of families and their friends have waited with bated breath not knowing if their loved ones held hostage were alive or dead. Thousands of innocent people, largely women and children, have died — caught between irreconcilable political differences. 

“Since October 7, 2023, tens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost to the ensuing fighting and bloodshed as Israel has attempted to root out Hamas and its network of cached weapons and tunnels in Gaza. Building forward from such a conflagration will take continued commitments toward peace and justice in the region. The world community must stay engaged. 

“President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and all the negotiators have worked overtime to put people above war, and hope above despair. As this New Year begins, the world community and nations in the Middle East have cause for much hope. The difficult road to peace lies ahead. But this agreement finally reached to release hostages and effect a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is step one on a long road forward. 

“Nothing can undo the horrors that have taken place over the last year and a half. It is my sincere hope that Hamas’ release of additional hostages and a cessation of hostilities can allow a long-awaited period of peace in this region. Humanitarian aid must be able to reach besieged areas unimpeded so continued dialogue can result in a long-term solution toward a lasting peace. 

“Even if it is fragile, a ceasefire demonstrates that mutual concessions and constructive solutions are possible. A negotiated truce and even the potential for a two-state solution lie ahead for all Israeli and Palestinian people. That will take committed leadership. Only then will a true lasting regional peace take hold. 

“Onward Israel, Onward Palestine, Onward Peace.” 

Since the start of the conflict in Gaza, Congresswoman Kaptur has remained actively engaged in urging an aggressive diplomatic path forward to address the ongoing conflict and work toward a negotiated two-state solution.

10:39:59 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:39:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC –  Today, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) announced a $2 Million Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative (CVIPI) Site-Based award from the Department of Justice (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) for the City of Toledo. This funding opportunity through the Department of Justice supports comprehensive, evidence-based efforts at reducing gun violence through partnership with community, local government, hospitals, victim service providers, law enforcement. The new funding will build on existing efforts to curb violence and identify gaps between high-risk populations and current community-based organization capacity. The award will provide training, technical assistance, and competitive subgrant and microgrant programs for individual and community-based organization crime prevention practitioners. This new funding follows $1.7 Million in Federal Justice awards for the City of Toledo  announced by Congresswoman Kaptur  (link is external)  in October 2024. 

“As a lifelong resident of Toledo and Northwest Ohio, I know that over time our city and region have undergone many changes. In an evolving age of policing and justice initiatives, we need to adapt to new and advanced methods of crime prevention that are proven to work”  said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09).  “This federal funding I helped to secure through the Department of Justice will allow the City of Toledo, Mayor Kapszukiewicz, and the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement to reduce gun violence through partnership with community, local government, hospitals, victim service providers, and law enforcement. We must use every tool in our arsenal to address issues of public safety. I applaud the City of Toledo and Department of Justice for this innovative approach that aims to address these problems in our communities. By working together to address root causes and provide necessary tools, we can make a safer Toledo and Northwest Ohio for all.” 

“This $2 Million grant from the Department of Justice is a win for Toledo residents,”  said Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz.  “By investing in evidence-based strategies and empowering community-led initiatives, this funding will help us continue the progress we’ve made in reducing violence, saving lives, and creating opportunities for our residents. We are deeply grateful to our federal partners, including Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, for championing this critical investment in our community’s future.” 

The award has a 3-year performance period, and will fund a full-time program coordinator for that 3-year period. The program will be administered by the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE). MONSE aims to prevent and reduce violent crime in the city of Toledo by building the capacity of violence prevention professionals, community-based organizations, and grassroots organizations engaged in violence intervention and prevention. This project aims to promote racial equity and remove barriers to access and opportunity for these historically underserved communities by reducing gun mortality and criminal justice system involvement through evidence-based CVIPI. 

Additionally, the award will fund: 

  * Quarterly microgrants awarded by the Community Action Table to community-based and grassroots initiatives aimed at addressing violence and/or promoting peace. 
  * An assessment of the current CVIPI landscape in collaboration between the Community Action Table, a multidisciplinary stakeholder working group, and research partners at Bowling Green State University and Boston University. This assessment will inform: 
    * Supporting the Violence Reduction Council to conduct community service provider reviews of fatal and nonfatal shootings. 

    * Establishment of a CVIPI capacity building and training Peace in Motion Academy. 
    * Competitive subgrants to two Community Based Organizations to implement and sustain evidence-based community-based violence intervention and prevention. 



Expected outcomes include: 

  * The enhancement of the Community Action Table, a cross-disciplinary group of individuals and organizations closest to the issue of gun violence. 
  * The enhancement of Peace In Motion: Toledo’s Path to Community Safety, a comprehensive five-year plan to address gun violence in Toledo. 
  * An increase in local community-based organization Community-based Violence Intervention and Prevention capacity. 
  * Increased access and implementation of evidence-based violence intervention and prevention services to high-risk populations.

10:40:00 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:40:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC –  Today, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) announced a $4 Million PRO Housing award from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the City of Toledo. Toledo was selected as one of 18 recipients nationwide that will receive part of a total $100 Million in an effort to help  communities boost housing supply and lower housing costs. The City of Toledo will address existing barriers to housing construction through a comprehensive update of the Toledo Planning and Zoning Code and development standards, development of housing design templates made available to housing developers to streamline permitting and lower the cost of new affordable housing production, and an appraisal gap financing program to incentivize housing production in targeted high Low-to-Moderate Income and weak market neighborhoods. 

“As a city and regional planner by training, I’ve worked on innovative Housing approaches throughout my career. I can say without a doubt that this is a win for the people of Toledo, and our region of Northwest Ohio,”  said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09).  “Too many families face burdensome housing costs, and this innovative approach to boost critical housing supply and help lower costs is a game changer. I look forward to working closely with Mayor Kapszukiewicz and the City of Toledo to ensure these funds have the intended effect. By working together we can achieve great things, and this $4 Million federal investment is an investment in the people of Toledo, and future homeowners and renters who will benefit from lowered housing costs.” 

“We need to build more homes to meet the needs of our growing communities – and we need to deploy every strategy available. The Biden-Harris Administration has been laser-focused on providing resources to local leaders to boost the supply of affordable housing,”  said HUD Agency Head, The Honorable Adrianne Todman.  “Today, we are delivering a historic $100 Million to lower housing costs by removing barriers to building more homes to rent and buy.” 

“Housing affordability is a top priority for our city,”  said Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz.  “This $4 Million grant is not just an investment in housing – it’s an investment in the people of Toledo. By addressing barriers to development, updating outdated zoning codes, and supporting targeted incentives for affordable housing production, we are creating a stronger, more equitable future for our community. I’m grateful for HUD’s recognition of Toledo’s vision and for the support of Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and other leaders who share our commitment to meeting the housing needs of our residents.” 

“The communities that were awarded PRO Housing funding demonstrated a commitment to overcoming local barriers. These funds will accelerate critical investments in housing, housing enabling infrastructure, and regional strategies to meet community needs,”  said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development  . “Given the number of applicants who expressed interest in addressing barriers to development and boosting housing supply, HUD will continue to share resources for communities to advance their proposed housing strategies.” 

A first of its kind program, PRO Housing helps communities continue to address restrictive land use or regulatory policies; improve and implement housing strategies; invest in local neighborhoods and increase community resilience; and facilitate the construction of new housing and repairs to existing homes. Grants to local governments, states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multi-jurisdictional entities range from $1 Million to $7 Million. Common barriers to housing identified in the round two PRO Housing applications include the high cost of land and development, lack of available units, underutilized vacant land and property, aging housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, displacement pressures, risks of extreme weather or environment hazards, and outdated local land-use and permitting policies and processes. 

These competitive funds – delivered in record time – are provided through HUD’s  Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing  (link is external)  (PRO Housing) program, to remove barriers to local housing production. Today’s announcement is part of the whole-of-government work to build more homes and lower housing costs, as outlined in the  Housing Supply Action Plan  (link is external)  . These grants build upon the  $85 million  (link is external)  to more than 20 communities that HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman awarded in July 2024.

10:40:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC –  Today, Co-Chair and Co-Founder of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-09), and Co-Chairs Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-01), Congressman Mike Quigley (D-IL-05), and Congressman Joe Wilson (R-SC-02) announced that they will reestablish the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus for the 119th Congress. 

“We are proud to reestablish the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus for the 119th Congress and reaffirm our enduring commitment to the vital US-Ukraine partnership. Established in 1997, just six years after Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union, for nearly three decades, the Ukraine Caucus has served as an indispensable forum within the US House of Representatives for strengthening bilateral relations and fostering a deeper appreciation of the Ukrainian-American community’s rich culture and contributions,"  said the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus. 

"As we begin the 119th Congress, and our friends in Ukraine continue to stand resilient against Russia’s unprovoked and brutal war of aggression, our work has never been more urgent. Together, we stand united in our mission to ensure Ukraine can achieve victory in its fight for peace and liberty, bolster transatlantic security, and champion the democratic values that bind our two nations,"  concluded the Co-Chairs.

10:40:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) is pressing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) leadership to immediately suspend enforcement of the USDA’s Electronic Identification (EID) tag mandate. 

The rule, which went into effect on November 5, 2024, requires producers to use both visually and electronically readable tags on covered cattle and bison herds. Many producers are concerned about the security and confidentiality of EID tag data. 

After receiving funding from Congress to address the price of the rulemaking, USDA initially said it would supply the tags at no cost to producers. However, animal health officials have not made these tags available to producers of covered livestock, leaving producers with no choice but to spend their own money on these tags or risk being noncompliant with Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) regulations. 

“Our American ranchers work hard every day to produce the highest quality beef in the world while contending with unpredictable markets, rising input costs and extreme weather,”  said Rounds  . “It is unreasonable to subject American producers to this unfunded mandate.” 

In 2024, Rounds introduced  legislation  to prevent the EID tag mandate from going into effect. The bill was endorsed by the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, R-CALF USA and the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association.

Dear Secretary Vilsack and Administrator Watson, 

I am concerned about the recent implementation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Electronic Identification (EID) rulemaking. While USDA initially committed to providing EID tags for covered livestock, animal health officials have failed to allocate the necessary infrastructure. 

Shortly after the rule went into effect on November 5, 2024, veterinarians began reporting an EID tag shortage. Unfortunately, producers are now being forced to grapple with an unfunded mandate. Farmers and ranchers are also concurrently dealing with high input costs and a worsening trade deficit. 

As you are aware, the cattle industry has remained sharply divided over USDA's EID rulemaking. While producers raised various concerns about the new regulations, potential costs remained a significant point of contention. In several USDA documents, animal health officials indicated EID tags would be made available to producers at no cost. USDA’s inability to supply necessary tag infrastructure has made producers even more skeptical of the new animal disease traceability (ADT) regulations. This is especially true in areas with a high concentration of cow-calf production, including the northern plains. 

The federal government has taken steps in the past to avoid unfunded mandates. After earlier ADT regulations required tags to be visually readable, the federal government supplied the necessary tags at no cost. To alleviate the concerns of many livestock producers, Congress acted to address the price of the rulemaking. In the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 spending measure, Congress directed USDA to spend no less than $15 million on EID tags and related infrastructure. Despite the efforts of appropriators, animal health officials have failed to make EID tags readily available to producers of covered livestock, exacerbating skepticism and opposition to the ADT regulations across the livestock industry. 

Given these circumstances, we urge USDA to suspend the enforcement of the new requirements under the EID rulemaking. In addition, we request a detailed explanation as to why USDA has not complied with the congressional directive to supply EID tags and infrastructure. 

Our American ranchers work hard every day to produce the highest quality beef in the world while contending with unpredictable markets, rising input costs and extreme weather. It is unreasonable to subject American producers to this unfunded mandate. 

I look forward to your prompt response.

With all of this in mind, tribal leaders have declared an extended state of emergency on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Despite repeated calls to honor their trust obligations, federal government leaders have failed to effectively or substantially address the issue. 

“While tribal officials have dealt with public safety issues for several years, a recent series of violent crimes has created a desperate situation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,”  wrote Rounds  . “The OST Department of Public Safety is critically understaffed and under-resourced, and federal assistance is essential to safeguard lives and restore order.”

I encourage federal law enforcement agencies to act swiftly and decisively to address this crisis.”

Dear Attorney General Garland and Secretary Haaland, 

The Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) is experiencing a serious breakdown in law and order. While tribal officials have dealt with public safety issues for several years, a recent series of violent crimes has created a desperate situation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The OST Department of Public Safety is critically understaffed and under-resourced, and federal assistance is essential to safeguard lives and restore order. Therefore, I urge federal officials to take any necessary steps to help  reduce violent crime on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. 

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the OST Department of Public Safety has responded to an increasing number of calls for assistance. According to tribal leaders, the OST Department of Public Safety receives as many as 166,000 calls for police services annually. With only 33 patrol officers, OST law enforcement officials are unable to effectively address serious public safety issues. 

The OST Department of Public Safety is also dealing with disproportionately high levels of violent crime. While almost all of the Great Plains Region is facing a public safety crisis, residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation are encountering the highest rates of violence. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime statistics, 131 death investigations occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation from 2013 to 2023. 

A series of violent events on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation have put tribal members in an extremely dangerous situation. In late December, tribal officers responded to several violent crimes, including the fatal shooting of a juvenile and a double homicide. The OST Department of Corrections, already operating at full capacity, lacks the ability to house additional offenders, further compounding the crisis. As tribal law enforcement officials struggle to address public safety issues, many reservation residents are living in fear. In response to these violent events, tribal leaders declared an extended state of emergency on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. 

As you know, the federal trust responsibility obligates the United States to provide adequate public safety services in Indian Country. Throughout the past two years, tribal leaders have asked federal law enforcement officials for assistance on numerous occasions. Despite these efforts, there has been no substantial federal response to the public safety crisis. 

The OST Department of Public Safety is in dire need of additional personnel, equipment and jail capacity. It is past time for federal officials to give this situation the attention it deserves.  I encourage federal law enforcement agencies to act swiftly and decisively to address this crisis. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

10:40:24 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  –  Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) today announced that they have reintroduced the Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act. This legislation would place 40 acres of land at the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre into restricted fee status, making certain that the land is held by both the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes for generations to come. 

The land at the site, located on the Pine Ridge Reservation, was purchased by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in 2022. Shortly after the purchase, both tribes signed a covenant, holding that the property shall be held and maintained as a memorial and sacred site without any development. 

“The Wounded Knee Massacre not only represents a low point in U.S.- Lakota relations, but it also serves as one of the darkest moments in our nation’s history,”  said Rounds  . “To date, the Wounded Knee Massacre grounds remain a symbolic site, with tribal members regularly visiting the area to honor the deceased. This legislation would keep this land in possession of the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to be protected and honored for generations to come.” 

“The Wounded Knee Massacre grounds have long served as a place where tribal members can remember and honor those who lost their lives,”  said Thune  . “This legislation would preserve these grounds as a memorial site and ensure the land remains with the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes for future generations.” 

This legislation passed the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in November 2023 during the 118th Congress. An attempt to pass the bill through unanimous consent was blocked on the Senate floor in November 2024.

10:40:30 root         DEBUG    Titles: Congressman Mfume, Ranking Member Connolly, Senator Kaine, and Representatives Fitzpatrick, Bacon Reintroduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect the Civil Service from Politicization
10:40:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:40:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, Congressman Kweisi Mfume, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, along with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, and Don Bacon, reintroduced the  Saving the Civil Service Act  (link is external)  to protect the federal workforce from politicization and political manipulation. The bipartisan legislation includes and builds on Ranking Member Connolly and Rep. Fitzpatrick’s Preventing a Patronage System Act, which passed the House in September 2022. Ranking Member Connolly, Rep. Fitzpatrick, and Sen. Kaine previously introduced the legislation in the 118th Congress. Senator Tim Kaine introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate. 

“An attack on our nation’s federal workforce is not only an attack on public servants and their families, but it is also an assault on the ability of the federal government to efficiently and effectively provide critical governmental services to citizens. The bipartisan legislation we introduced today would protect hardworking federal employees from the ‘pendulum swings’ of electoral politics,”  said Rep. Mfume.  “The fact that this bill is supported by Members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle is an indication of the seriousness and substance of the threats being made against our friends and neighbors devoted to civil service, and signals the urgency by which we must act to protect our federal workers.”   
  
“The civil servants who make up our federal workforce are the engine that keeps our federal government running,”  said Ranking Member Connolly.  “They are our country’s greatest asset. We rely on their experience and expertise to provide every basic government service—from delivering the mail to helping families in the wake of natural disasters. The President-elect’s promise to remove qualified experts and replace them with political loyalists is a direct threat to our national security and our government’s ability to function the way the American people expect it to. It threatens to create a system wherein benefits and services are delivered based on the politics, not the needs, of the recipient. Expertise, not political fealty, must define our civil service.”   
  
“Every day, our nation’s federal employees go to work for the American people to administer Social Security, Medicare, and veterans’ benefits, protect our national security, and provide other critical services to communities across our country,”  said Sen. Kaine.  “We must ensure our federal workers continue to be hired based on their expertise and experience, not their political party. I’m concerned by the President-elect’s proposed plans to target the federal workforce, and I will keep working with my colleagues to pass this legislation to protect the merit-based federal civil service system.”   
  
“When our nation’s federal civil servants take their oath, their duty is to the American people—not political parties or partisan agendas,”  said Rep. Fitzpatrick.  “Our bipartisan Saving the Civil Service Act is about protecting what makes our government work: integrity, fairness, and accountability. By upholding a merit-based hiring system, we ensure that federal employment serves one purpose—to deliver effective and efficient service to the people, free from the shadow of political interference.”   
  
“Our civil service employees perform research and analysis that is valuable to Congress, and we need to protect them from being unilaterally terminated just because they may be at conflict with any Administration in charge-Republican or Democrat,”  said Rep. Bacon.  “While it is prudent to look at numbers of civilian employees, we should not strip them of due process and their civil service protections without the express permission of Congress.”   
  
On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted service. This executive order would undermine the merit system principles of our federal workforce by requiring agency heads to reclassify “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that removes their due process rights and civil service protections.   
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act would ensure the civil service system cannot be politically manipulated by: 

  * Preventing any position in the federal competitive service created after September 30, 2020, from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. 
  * Installing a cap on the number of conversions to the frozen excepted service schedule (Schedule C). The cap cannot exceed more than 1% of the total number of employees at such agency as of the first day of such term, or five employees, whichever is greater. 
  * Requiring that anyone who is converted provide consent for that conversion, and a report to Congress on any conversions. 

  
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act is cosponsored by the following Senators: Markey, Whitehouse, Van Hollen, Murray Shaheen, King, Duckworth, Wyden, Schatz, Hickenlooper, Fetterman, Hirono, Warner, Sanders, Padilla, Alsobrooks.    
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act is endorsed by the following organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the Federal Managers Association (FMA), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).

“  It is an honor to be recognized by the Susan B.

We must be relentless in defending the lives of children—both before and after birth—and we must stop the practice of using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. Life is precious, and we must defend it.”

10:40:33 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:40:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  ­– Congressman Nathaniel Moran (R-TX-01) released the following statement after voting to support Congresswoman Nancy Mace’s (R-SC-01)  Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act  , which passed the House on Thursday:    
  
“Over the last four years, Americans have witnessed the severity of an Administration complacent in addressing our southern border. Time and time again, we have dealt with the reality that our borders are being overrun, our communities are no longer safe, and our government does more to protect illegal aliens than its own citizens.   
  
“  I am proud of the passage of H.R. 30, the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, because it creates a ground of inadmissibility for aliens who are convicted of, admit to having committed, or admit to committing acts that constitute the essential elements of a sex offense as defined under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. By creating new grounds of inadmissibility and removability and expanding current grounds for aliens who commit sex offenses and domestic violence offenses, H.R. 30 produces safer streets for every American, prevents new victims from being targeted, and allows for such criminal aliens to be removed from the United States.  ”   
  
"No family should endure the heartbreak the families of Laken Riley, Mollie Tibbetts, Karina Vetrano, and Maddie Hines have experienced. Every woman and every girl deserves to feel safe in their own community,”  said Congresswoman Mace.  “The radical left doesn’t agree with this. 145 liberals in Congress love illegal immigrant rapists and murder.. House Republicans united to expand protections for women and put the safety of Americans first.”    
  
“This isn’t complicated—keeping criminal illegal aliens out of our country and off our streets is just common sense,”  Congresswoman Mace continued.  “Women should be able to walk down the street without fear, and families should feel safe in their own neighborhoods.”    
  
Background:   
Introduced by Congresswoman Mace, this legislation amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make illegal immigrants who are convicted of, who admit having committed, or who admit committing sex offenses or domestic violence inadmissible and deportable from the United States.

KLTV    
January 16, 2025    
  
East Texas Congressman Nathaniel Moran (R-TX-01) is one of the lawmakers trying to push through an act that dictates how flags should be flown on Inauguration Day.   
  
The new legislation would make it so American flags must be flown at their highest peak on Inauguration Day.   
  
In a press release, Moran said, "Inauguration Day should be a time for celebration and excitement as we look ahead to our new Administration."   
  
This comes in the midst of controversy over the fact that flags will be flying at half staff this coming Monday following the death of former President Jimmy Carter.   
  
Despite the 30-day order from President Joe Biden, Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered flags to be flown at full staff at the Texas state capitol and all state buildings for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.   
  
This legislation still allows for the American flag to be ceremonially lowered at the President's discretion on any day before or after the Presidential Inauguration Day, according to Moran's press release.   
  
Moran spoke to us about the legislation. You can watch the full interview above.

10:40:34 root         DEBUG    Titles: Congressman Moran's Statement Following Passage of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in the 119th Congress
10:40:34 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:40:34 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Congressman Nathaniel Moran (R-TX-01) released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 28, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  , by a vote of 218 to 206:   
  
“I was proud to vote for this critical legislation,  which ensures that only biological females are able to compete in women’s sports  . As the father of two daughters, I want them to have the opportunity to participate in sports in an environment that nurtures their growth and well-being—not one that puts them at increased risk both on and off the field. American citizens have made it clear: biological men should not compete in women’s sports. Our daughters should not be forced to adhere to radical policies that undermine truth, safety, and reality.  I commend  Congressman  Greg Steube for his leadership on this important legislatio  n which ensures safety and fairness for all women and girls in sports.”   
  
Background:   
H.R. 28, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  , will require schools that receive federal funding to recognize sex based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth. This will safeguard female athletic programs by only allowing biological women and girls to participate in a practice, compete, and receive any benefits associated with women’s athletic programs.   
  
In the 118th Congress, House Republicans included the defense of women’s sports in their Commitment to America agenda. Within the first 100 days of the Republican Majority, the House passed Congressman Steube’s bill by a vote of 219 to 203, with no Democrats supporting the measure. A Senate companion bill, introduced by Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), was not brought to the floor by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer under the Democrat-led Senate.

10:40:36 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:40:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  ­– Congressman Nathaniel Moran (R-TX-01) voted in favor of Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith’s (R-MO-08)  United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act  , which passed the House on Wednesday. The legislation would stop the double taxation of American workers, reduce dependence on China, and provide a pathway for a more robust economic partnership. Ahead of the vote, Congressman Moran offered remarks in support of the legislation on the House floor.   
  
“In my home state of Texas, Taiwanese tech companies are investing billions in advanced manufacturing, but double taxation threatens their ability to operate effectively,”  said Congressman Moran.  “Today’s bipartisan bill equips us to expand cross-border investment, safeguard critical supply chains, and push back against China’s growing influence. Without this legislation, we risk alienating one of our strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific region—Taiwan. And we risk ceding more power to China and the Strait of Taiwan and isolating ourselves further on the global economic stage. That is simply unacceptable.”   
  
Specifically, the Legislation Would: 

  * Put American Workers First:  American workers and businesses benefit from the U.S.’ deepening economic relationship with Taiwan, which already supports $1.5 billion in U.S. exports. Establishing a tax treaty with Taiwan helps U.S.-based semiconductor and chip manufacturers grow in the U.S. and further secures strategic supply chains. 
  * Ensure Americans Receive Equal Treatment:  Americans are currently unable to receive the same tax benefits from Taiwan that are available to other countries.  Currently, the U.S. is Taiwan’s largest trading partner without a tax treaty. 
  * Reduce U.S. Dependence on China:  This legislation helps reduce the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s control of American supply lines by instead providing better partners for the U.S. to grow its economy. 



  
  
WATCH: Congressman Moran’s Full Remarks in Support of the Bill 

Congressman Moran’s Full Remarks as Delivered:    
“Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act.   
  
“Taiwan companies in America, including those in critical semiconductor sectors, face tax burdens due to the lack of a U.S.-Taiwan tax agreement. Taiwan is one of our largest trading partners without such a treaty, yet it supports more than 22,000 U.S. jobs and contributed $185 million dollars to U.S. research in 2021.   
  
“This bill addresses these issues by eliminating double taxation, reducing withholding tax rates, and clarifying residency rules. It strengthens our economic alliance with Taiwan, ensuring a reliable supply chain for semiconductors and reducing dependence on China and our adversaries.   
  
“In my home state of Texas, Taiwanese tech companies are investing billions in advanced manufacturing, but double taxation threatens their ability to operate effectively. Today’s bipartisan bill equips us to expand cross-border investment, safeguard critical supply chains, and push back against China’s growing influence.   
  
“Without this legislation, we risk alienating one of our strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific region—Taiwan. And we risk ceding more power to China and the Strait of Taiwan and isolating ourselves further on the global economic stage. That is simply unacceptable.   
  
“This bill is critical to reaffirming our commitment to economic growth, national security, and the U.S.-Taiwan partnership. I urge my colleagues in Congress to support this vital legislation to do just that. With that, I yield back.”

During the hearing, Congressman Moran pressed witnesses on the negative impacts of allowing the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  (TCJA) to expire at the end of 2025, specifically highlighting the harmful consequences this would have for the First Congressional District of Texas.   
  
“In my district, a family of four earning the district’s median yearly income of $61,182 would see a $1,142 tax increase should the Trump Tax Cuts expire at the end of the year  ,”said Congressman Moran.  “For a family of four, this money is worth about six weeks of groceries in my region. It is also enough money to cover about 27 full tanks of gas – even in our big old trucks. Groceries and gas are important things to every American and every East Texan that I represent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cannot be allowed to expire. We must continue its provisions to allow families to thrive and businesses to grow.”

10:40:42 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:40:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: In new letter, top Democratic advocates for Supreme Court transparency press Roberts and the Conference to allow for basic fact-finding in light of Justice Alito’s habit of ethically-questionable conduct 

Washington, DC  – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) sent a  letter  (link is external)  Friday to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the Judicial Conference urging the Court and the Conference to set up a mechanism for basic fact-finding amid swirling ethics questions that arose from a phone call between Justice Samuel Alito and President-elect Donald Trump this week. 

“Earlier this week, Justice Alito and President-elect Trump spoke on a private call by phone, while the President-elect was involved in  several high-profile cases pending or likely to come before the Supreme Court, including  Donald J. Trump v. New York  and  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland  . This contact could potentially implicate provisions of the Supreme Court’s new code of conduct and of federal law... We humbly suggest that this incident provides yet another reason for the Judicial Conference and the Court to agree on some sort of neutral fact-finding when a justice’s conduct is questioned,”  wrote Whitehouse and Johnson. 

“No convincing reason exists for the Supreme Court of the United States to remain the only court in the country without an enforceable process for policing misconduct. We submit that this latest incident provides an additional reminder of the need for the Court and Conference to adopt some basic elements of legal process: a place to file complaints, a fact-finding process for credible complaints, and a neutral determination of ethical compliance,”  added  Whitehouse and Johnson. 

On Wednesday,  reporting from ABC News  (link is external)  uncovered a phone call between Justice Alito and President-elect Trump while the President-elect was involved in cases pending or likely to come before the Court in the same week, including  Donald J. Trump v. New York  and  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland.  While Justice Alito denied that the two discussed any of these matters, Whitehouse and Johnson’s letter urges an investigation and neutral fact-finding because the Justice has shown a prior willingness to improperly discuss matters that could come before the Court. 

Days after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed Whitehouse and Johnson’s  Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency (SCERT) Act  (link is external)  , Justice Alito, in an unusual interview with Court Leonard Leo’s lawyer David Rivkin, stated: “I know this is a controversial view, but I’m willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.” The interview was published as an op-ed on the  Wall Street Journal  editorial page. Leo and three different right-wing billionaires’ lawyers have objected to congressional inquiries into their undisclosed gifts to right-wing justices, citing the same theory Justice Alito offered in his  Wall Street Journal  editorial page interview. 

Whitehouse  sent a letter  (link is external)  to Justice Alito requesting information regarding the improper comments. Whitehouse also wrote a  letter  (link is external)  Chief Justice Roberts to lodge an ethics complaint against Justice Alito for violating several canons of judicial ethics, and later submitted a  follow-up complaint  (link is external)  . 

Whitehouse and Johnson’s  SCERT Act would require Supreme Court justices to adopt a binding code of conduct, create a mechanism to investigate alleged violations of the code of conduct and other laws, improve disclosure and transparency when a justice has a connection to a party or amicus before the Court, end the practice of justices ruling on their own conflicts of interests, and require justices to explain their recusal decisions to the public. 

In December, Whitehouse released a  report  (link is external)  that found every state supreme court (or equivalent high court) subjects its judges or justices to ethics reviews—similar to the processes that apply to all federal judges except the Supreme Court under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act.

10:40:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: **Shaheen was a key supporter of measures in the Inflation Reduction Act that empowered Medicare to directly negotiate the prices of certain high-costs prescription drugs for the first time** 

(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) applauded the selection of 15 more prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part D for direct price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, helping lower costs for Americans who rely on these medications. Nationwide, 5.3 million Americans with Medicare Part D coverage take prescription drugs set for negotiation in 2025 to treat a variety of conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Shaheen was a key supporter of measures in the  Inflation Reduction Act  that empowered Medicare to directly negotiate the prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs for the first time. 

“Thousands of Granite Staters rely on prescription drugs to treat life-threatening diseases, like diabetes and cancer, and they shouldn’t have to break the bank to afford them,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “Today’s announcement will help lower costs and make these critical prescriptions accessible for more Americans—and it follows on action that’s already been taken through the  Inflation Reduction Act  to combat the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. I hope the incoming administration takes note and supports Medicare's ongoing drug price negotiations.” 

Shaheen has spearheaded efforts to combat rising drug prices and make essential medications more affordable, including by supporting key provisions in the  Inflation Reduction Act  .  For the first time, the  Inflation Reduction Act  provides Medicare the ability to directly negotiate the prices of certain high-cost drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Shaheen also pushed for the inclusion of a provision in the  Inflation Reduction Act  that capped out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients with diabetes by ensuring that Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage health plans limit copays or coinsurance to no more than $35 per month, 25% of list price, or 25% of the negotiated price. Shaheen also supported a measure to set a $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D out-of-pocket drug costs that went into effect on January 1 of this year. 

As  co-chair of the bipartisan U.S. Senate Diabetes Caucus  , Shaheen has consistently pressed to hold insulin manufacturers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers  accountable  for the skyrocketing cost of life-saving insulin. Shaheen recently  delivered floor remarks  in support of her bipartisan legislation with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME),  the  INSULIN Act  , which would comprehensively address the skyrocketing costs of insulin and remove barriers to care making it more accessible to millions of Americans.

10:40:44 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:40:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH),  Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a senior member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship,  Ron Wyden (D-OR),  Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee,  and Tim Kaine (D-VA) today introduced the  Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes on Imported Goods Act  to shield American businesses and consumers from rising prices imposed by tariffs on imported goods into the United States. The Senators’ legislation would keep costs down for imported goods by limiting the authority of the  International Emergency Economic Powers Act  (IEEPA)—which allows a President to immediately place unlimited tariffs after declaring a national emergency—while preserving IEEPA’s use for sanctions and other tools. 

“At a time when Granite Staters are facing higher prices, we should be looking at every opportunity to cut costs – not raise prices on consumers and businesses,”  said Shaheen.  “Our bill would help ensure that households across the country do not face immediate tax hikes on everyday goods like coffee and fresh vegetables.” 

“The International Emergency Economic Powers Act was never intended to serve as a blank check for the president to levy unlimited tariffs on allies and trading partners around the world. Congress has given the president other powerful tools to confront China and other nations that cheat on trade or pose national security threats. Donald Trump should use those tools in a targeted way to help American workers and businesses get ahead, not abuse IEEPA as a pretense to impose sweeping tariffs that will raise prices for working families with massive blanket taxes on the things they buy every day,”  said Wyden. 

“Virginians want lower—not higher—costs, but President-elect Trump plans to impose broad-based tariffs, which would raise the price of everyday goods and hurt every American,”  said Kaine.  “That’s why I’m joining my colleagues in introducing this legislation to make it a lot harder for the President to impose sweeping tariffs, by prohibiting the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for that kind of action.” 

The authorities granted to the President through the IEEPA represent the broadest of the possible paths an administration can take to impose sweeping tariffs. The  Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes on Imported Goods Act  clarifies that the IEEPA may not be used to increase costs on American consumers and families by placing tariffs or tariff-rate quotas on imported goods. The legislation would preserve crucial national security tools granted to the President through the IEEPA authority to impose sanctions or to block all imports of goods that are dangerous to national security and would preserve the ability to push back on unfair trade practices of the People’s Republic of China. 

Broad import taxes of between 10 and 20 percent on all imported goods into the U.S.  would almost certainly be passed on to American consumers  . Sweeping tariffs could cause a typical family’s annual costs to  increase by $3,900  , including a  $200 rise in grocery bills  ,  harm  domestic manufacturers and the auto industry and severely  raise prices  on goods exchanged with Canada, New Hampshire’s top trading partner.

10:40:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), alongside Representatives Chris Pappas (NH-01) and Maggie Goodlander (NH-02), are welcoming $14,110,558 in federal grants for New Hampshire organizations that provide housing assistance and supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. This funding comes through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) Program and the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program (YHDP), which work with nonprofits, states and local governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals, families and youth, as well as individuals fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. 

“Every Granite Stater deserves a roof over their head, and that requires federal funding working hand in hand with communities to get resources where they’re needed most,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “I'm glad to see this funding coming to organizations in our state that work to house Granite Staters and provide critical supportive services.” 

“Granite Staters who are homeless – including those fleeing heartbreaking circumstances like domestic violence – should know that there are resources to help,”  said Senator Hassan.  “I am pleased to see more than $14 million in federal funding heading to New Hampshire to provide safe temporary and permanent housing for Granite Staters in need, and help people build more stable futures.” 

“Far too many Granite Staters continue to experience homelessness or a lack of safe shelter. Our state and local governments, nonprofits, and community partners are on the frontlines of this crisis, and this federal funding will provide them with resources to support families and individuals experiencing homelessness,”  said Congressman Pappas.  “Housing is fundamental to one’s health and wellbeing, and more work must be done to grow our housing supply, expand mental health resources, and help people find safe and affordable housing.” 

“Having a home is a cornerstone of the American Dream but across New Hampshire, lack of access to safe, reliable housing has put that dream out of reach for far too many Granite Staters,”  said Representative Goodlander.  “I’m proud to help announce these federal resources heading to our state to address our housing crisis and support the important work of extraordinary organizations across New Hampshire.” 

The New Hampshire Congressional delegation is committed to ensuring Granite State communities have the resources needed to tackle the housing affordability crisis. Last year, Senators Shaheen and Hassan and Representative Pappas  celebrated more than $30 million in federal grants  for New Hampshire to build more affordable housing across the Granite State. 

As a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee and Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen worked to include key provisions from her  Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act  in the Fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Shaheen’s standalone legislation would ensure that hundreds of thousands of low-income tenants in rural areas are able to maintain access to safe and affordable housing. Another Shaheen-led bipartisan bill to increase access to rural housing  was signed into law the same day  . Together, the two bills will bolster existing rural housing options, make new construction easier and protect renters across the Granite State  . 

Shaheen also helped introduced the  Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act  to help local governments reduce homelessness as well as a bicameral bill that would protect the rights of residents of manufactured housing communities. Shaheen secured over  $22 million in Congressionally Directed Spending in the FY24  government funding bills to address New Hampshire’s housing, transportation and urban development needs.

10:40:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH),  former Chair and now  a senior member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  , released the following statement after her meeting with former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as the next Small Business Administrator. Photos from the meeting can be found  here  . 

“My meeting with Senator Loeffler focused on how we can best work to ensure the Small Business Administration fuels growth and serves small businesses in the Granite State and across our great nation,”  said Shaheen.  “As a former small business owner myself and the former Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I’ve seen firsthand how support from Small Business Administration programs can strengthen our small businesses, which are integral to our national economy, by gaining access to credit, cutting red tape, connecting them to new markets and more. I look forward to discussing these issues and learning more about Senator Loeffler’s vision for the agency during her confirmation hearing.” 

During her time as  Chair of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee  , Shaheen fought for New Hampshire’s—and America’s—small businesses. Shaheen was  laser-focused on addressing some of the biggest challenges  small business owners face, reporting key legislation out of committee that included critical improvements to the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) and improved access to federal contracting opportunities for small businesses.

10:40:47 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:40:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) celebrated $70 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy through the  Inflation Reduction Act  that has been delivered to New Hampshire to implement home energy rebate programs that will help Granite Staters cut home energy costs. To date, Shaheen has helped secure more than $150 million in federal funding from the  Inflation Reduction Act  and  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  for energy efficiency and clean energy programs in New Hampshire. 

“At a time when costs are straining budgets for too many Granite Staters, I’m proud to deliver this federal investment for the state to implement programs that will help folks save money on utility bills,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I’ve been working to get federal dollars into New Hampshire so more people can benefit from solar, heat pumps and other energy efficiency improvements. I’m glad that the state will be making these funds available to help Granite Staters cut energy costs.” 

Shaheen has championed work to secure federal investments in clean energy and energy efficiency initiatives and to lower energy costs across New Hampshire. In the  Fiscal Year 2024 government funding bills  , Shaheen helped defend key efficiency programs at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) from cuts, including securing $366 million for weatherization efforts and $66 million for the State Energy Program, which work to bring down energy bills for families and communities. Shaheen also secured continued support for the annual U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER) that tracks  key jobs data  in the energy sector. 

Shaheen was a key supporter of the  Inflation Reduction Act  , including $9 billion for new consumer home energy rebate programs. The  Inflation Reduction Act’s  rebate program for whole-home energy efficiency retrofits is based on the  HOPE for HOMES Act  that Senator Shaheen co-led with Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). This program also includes workforce training funding. 

Shaheen was a lead negotiator of the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  , which provided an approximately $6 billion investment in energy efficiency, including funding for residential, municipal, industrial and federal entities to implement efficiency upgrades based upon her  longstanding bipartisan legislation  with former U.S. Senator Rob Portman. Granite Staters looking for energy efficiency resources can check out  Senator Shaheen’s Federal Energy Resource Guide  . 

The following federal funds have been awarded to New Hampshire for energy efficiency and clean energy programs: 

From the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 

  * State Energy Program  , $3.5 million to support state planning activities and programs that help reduce emissions in all sectors of the economy; 
  * Weatherization Assistance Program  , $18 million to support home energy efficiency improvements for low-income households; 
  * Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program  , $831,100 to establish a revolving loan fund to support energy efficiency audits, upgrades and retrofits in buildings; 
  * Grid Resiliency Grant Program  , $9.1 million to support projects to prevent outages and enhance the resilience of the electric grid. 



From the Inflation Reduction Act 

  * Home Energy Performance-Based, Whole-House Rebates  , $34.7 million to provide rebates that discount the price of energy-saving retrofits in homes and apartment buildings; 
  * High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program  , $34.7 million to provide rebates that provide households discounts for high efficiency home appliances and equipment; 
  * The State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grants  , $1.259 million for workforce development programs to train, test and certify residential energy efficiency and electrification contractors; 
  * Solar for All  , $43.5 million to support community solar, including in resident-owned communities, on workforce housing and public housing; 
  * Climate Pollution Reduction Grants  , $3 million for planning and a portion of $450 million for New England Heat Pump Accelerator to help expand adoption of heat pumps.

10:40:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: **Hegseth would not commit to upholding the Women, Peace and Security law that ensures women are involved at every stage and on every level of national security** 

(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH),  a senior member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC),  questioned Pete Hegseth, the President-elect's nominee to be the next U.S. Secretary of Defense, today about his support for women service members during his SASC-led confirmation hearing. When pressed by Shaheen to commit to supporting the  Women, Peace and Security law  she led  to enhance representation of women in national security to prevent and resolve global conflicts, Hegseth would not commit to upholding it. Click  here  to view Shaheen’s full remarks and questioning. 

On not getting a meeting with nominee Hegseth, Shaheen said:  “One reason that I wanted to meet with you was because I thought it would be really helpful to better understand your views on women in the military, because you've made a number of surprising statements about women serving in the military.” 

On Hegseth changing his view on women in the military after being nominated, Shaheen asked:  “Why should women in our military, if you were the Secretary of Defense, believe that they would have a fair shot and an equal opportunity to rise through the ranks? If on the one hand you say that women are not competent, they make our military less effective. And on the other hand you say, 'oh no, now that I've been nominated to be Secretary of Defense, I've changed my view on women in the military.’ What do you have to say to the almost 400,000 women who are serving today about your position on whether they should be capable to rise to the highest ranks of our military?” 

On preserving the  Women, Peace and Security  law at the Department of Defense, Shaheen asked  :  “[The  Women, Peace and Security law  ] is a law that was signed during President-elect Trump’s first term. It was legislation that I sponsored with Republican Senator Capito of West Virginia, it was cosponsored by Marco Rubio, the nominee to be the President-elect's Secretary of State, it was led in the House of Representatives by Kristi Noem, the President-elect's nominee to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. It mandates that women be included in all aspects of our national security, including conflict resolution and peace negotiations. And at the Department of Defense, it has been the law for eight years under both the Trump and Biden administrations... Based on your comments, it appears that the example that you would like to set, not only for women in this country but for women across the globe, 50 percent of the world’s population, as the prospective nominee to lead the most combat credible military in the entire world, is that women should not have an equal opportunity. So will you commit to preserving the  Women, Peace and Security law  at DoD, and including in your budget the requisite funding to continue to restore and resource these programs throughout the DoD?” 

When Hegseth responded that he would review the program to determine if it advances American interests, Shaheen said, “Well since former President Trump signed the law, I hope that he agrees with you.” 

As the second-ranking Democrat on SASC, Senator Shaheen is instrumental in helping to accomplish top national security objectives and enhancing New Hampshire’s role in support of America’s national defense. A member of the Committee since 2011, Shaheen has voted to confirm multiple nominees from both parties under multiple administrations. 

Senator Shaheen is the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also serves on the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs and Defense. In 2018, Shaheen re-established the bipartisan  U.S. Senate NATO Observer Group  with U.S. Senator Tillis (R-NC). Senator Shaheen believes that a strong and active United States is fundamental to securing our national interests at home and abroad. She also believes that U.S. global leadership is directly tied to the strength of our ideals, our alliances and our diplomacy, and she is constantly working to ensure our national security policies reflect our broader democratic values. 

In 2017, Senator Shaheen’s bipartisan legislation with Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), the  Women, Peace and Security Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump  , requiring the U.S. Government to strengthen the meaningful participation of women in conflict prevention and peace negotiations.

The office will promote innovation and stimulate the economy by connecting entrepreneurs to government resources, supporting students and teachers through STEM education programs, gathering feedback from regional stakeholders and educating the public about intellectual property.  You can view photos from the signing  here. 

“This office will help the innovators and entrepreneurs of New Hampshire and New England by putting USPTO personnel and resources closer to them, fostering Granite State innovation and bolstering the state’s economy,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “I was thrilled to join Acting Director Brent, NNECOO Director Modricker and representatives from UNH to celebrate the signing of this agreement.” 

“The establishment of this first Community Outreach Office represents a milestone in USPTO’s commitment to expanding access to the innovation ecosystem and supporting more inventors, creators, and entrepreneurs everywhere,”  said Derrick Brent, Acting Under Secretary for Intellectual Property and Acting Director of the USPTO.  “I am thankful for the partnership with the University of New Hampshire which has a long history of supporting innovation from idea to market.” 

As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for the 118  th  Congress, which has jurisdiction over USPTO, Shaheen has long supported the USPTO’s community outreach efforts. Shaheen  advocated  for the first USPTO Community Outreach Office in the nation to be established in New Hampshire. The office will support economic development across the region by promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.

10:40:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins and 14 of her Senate colleagues introduced the  Dismantle Iran’s Proxy Act  . This legislation would re-designate the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). This FTO designation would result in severe consequences, like asset freezes and criminal penalties for any person, state, or organization materially supporting the Houthis. 

“Re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization is long overdue. Since the tragic events of October 7, 2023, the Houthis have worked alongside other Iranian proxies to attack our ally Israel and destabilize the region,”  said Senator Collins  . “Thanks to the brave efforts of U.S. forces—many operating from Bath-built destroyers—and our allies, attempts by the Houthis to undermine international commerce have been thwarted. This legislation would help ensure that these vital efforts to safeguard our national security continue, and that the Houthis are held accountable for their terrorist actions.” 

Specifically, the  Dismantle Iran’s Proxy Act would: 

  1. Re-designate the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization; 


  2. Require a strategy to degrade Houthi capabilities in the Red Sea; and 


  3. Require a report on obstacles to humanitarian aid provision in areas of Yemen under Houthi control. 



In January 2021, President Trump designated the Houthis an FTO. After taking office, President Biden revoked the FTO designation while simultaneously freezing offensive arms sales to Saudi Arabia. 

Joining Senator Collins in introducing the  Dismantle Iran’s Proxy Act  were Senators Jim Risch (R-ID), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Katie Britt (R-AL), and Mike Rounds (R-SD)

Washington, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Susan Collins was awarded the Army Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest public service recognition awarded by the U.S. Army. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth conferred the honor in recognition of Senator Collins’ support for the Army through her leadership on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Lieutenant General Paul Chamberlain, Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller, presented Senator Collins with the award on Capitol Hill. 

“Receiving this award from the U.S. Army is a tremendous honor, and I am grateful to Secretary Wormuth and the leadership of the Army for this recognition,”  said Senator Collins  . “Throughout my Senate service, maintaining a strong national defense has been one of my highest priorities. This commitment not only enhances our national security at a time when we face the most dangerous global security environment in 50 years, but it also supports good-paying jobs at Bath Iron Works, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Pratt & Whitney, and elsewhere across the State of Maine.” 

The Distinguished Public Service Medal is awarded by the Secretary of the Army to individuals whose distinguished service makes a substantial contribution to the Army’s mission.

In the Fiscal Year 2024 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, Senator Collins secured more than $4 billion in funding to help design and implement local solutions to end homelessness, including through programs like the CoC Program. 

The CoC Program is designed to promote a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness; to provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, states, and local governments to quickly re-house homeless individuals, families, persons fleeing domestic violence, and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused by homelessness; to promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless individuals and families; and to optimize self-sufficiency among those experiencing homelessness.

10:40:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Susan Collins issued the following statement regarding the ceasefire and hostage agreement reached between Israel and Hamas: 

“Today’s ceasefire and hostage agreement is a welcome announcement. It’s been fifteen long months since Iranian-backed terrorists launched their brutal attack on Israel and kidnapped more than 240 innocent hostages. I went to Israel three weeks after the Hamas massacre, and will never forget seeing firsthand the devastation Hamas terrorists wreaked on Israeli families and communities. 

“While there is much about the agreement and the future that we do not yet know, what we do know is that the tragedy of October 7 can never be allowed to occur again. 

“As we honor the innocent lives lost and await the safe return of those still held captive by Hamas, let us keep the hostages, their family and friends in our hearts and minds, and continue to stand with our treasured ally Israel as the nation navigates this new reality.”

10:40:54 root         DEBUG    Titles: Connolly, Strong Reintroduce Legislation to Expand and Improve CyberCorps Scholarship for Service Program
10:40:54 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:40:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA), the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Congressman Dale Strong (R-AL), Member of the House Committees on Appropriations and Homeland Security, reintroduced the  CyberCorps Enhancement Act  , bipartisan legislation to improve and expand the existing CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program. Connolly and Strong previously introduced the legislation in the 118th Congress.   
  
“The federal government has a lot of work to do when it comes to recruiting and retaining the next generation of the federal workforce, especially in critical fields like cybersecurity and emerging technologies,”  said Connolly.  “This bipartisan legislation will go a long way toward strengthening our nation’s cybersecurity posture by ensuring we can attract the best of the best to serve our country.”   
  
“North Alabama is a national leader in cybersecurity education, with one of the highest numbers of participants and graduates in the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program. This legislation will allow our local colleges and universities to continue to produce highly skilled, U.S.-trained cybersecurity experts to protect our national security interests and contribute to cutting-edge research,”  said Strong.  “Strengthening this pipeline is not just about defending our nation against cyber threats—it’s about creating high-paying, high-impact jobs here at home and ensuring America continues to lead the way in cybersecurity, innovation, and defense.”   
  
The CyberCorps SFS Program currently offers scholarships for up to three years of undergraduate or graduate education in cybersecurity, supporting a wide range of degrees—including Ph.D., master’s, bachelor’s, and associate degrees—focused on cybersecurity in fields such as AI, aerospace, quantum technologies, and more. In return, recipients commit to working in a cybersecurity role within the U.S. government for a period equal to the length of their scholarship.   
  
George Mason University, located in Virginia’s 11th District, recently received a $3,800,000 CyberCorps SFS grant for their project EAGLE: Empowering American Government Leadership in Cybersecurity through Education.   
  
The CyberCorps Enhancement Act proposes two key improvements to the existing CyberCorps SFS Program: 

  * Extending Scholarship Support: Increases the statutory cap on scholarships from three to five years, accommodating students pursuing advanced degrees like Ph.D.s and expanding the pool of highly specialized cybersecurity professionals. 
  * Clarifying Loan Repayment Terms: Ensures the full amount of student loans is eligible for forgiveness. This change addresses concerns raised by participants about loan repayment challenges. 

  
  
  
“George Mason University enthusiastically supports Congressman Connolly and Congressman Strong’s CyberCorps Enhancement Act, because it will allow more of our graduate students to benefit and enhances the talent pool in cybersecurity for the Federal government. Congressman Connolly is to be commended for his continued leadership in reintroducing this legislation. As a designated National Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity, George Mason has been a recognized national leader in cybersecurity research, education and training,”  said Kenneth Ball, Dean of the College of Engineering and Computing, George Mason University.   
  
“The University of Alabama in Huntsville is home to one of the largest cohorts of CyberCorps Scholarship for Service recipients in the country, comprised of 92 incredibly bright scholars in the critical fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence,”  said Dr. Tommy Morris, director of the University of Alabama in Huntsville’s Center for Cybersecurity Research and Education and eminent scholar of computer engineering.  “The proposed changes will allow us to grow this important program by attracting more doctoral students, which will ultimately enhance national security considering recipients must work for the federal government upon graduation. UAH proudly offers top cybersecurity programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels, and one of the largest cybersecurity research centers in America – the Center for Cybersecurity Research and Education – is located on our campus in Huntsville, a community that is leading the way in cybersecurity work. We are thankful to Congressman Strong for spearheading this effort.”   
  
"At Hampton University, we are committed to equipping our students with the tools and expertise needed to excel in the ever-evolving field of cyber security,"  said LTG Darrell K. Williams, U.S. Army Retired, President of Hampton University.  "The CyberCorps Enhancement Act of 2025 is a pivotal advancement, and I commend Rep. Connolly and Rep. Strong for their vision in extending the scholarship program to five years. This initiative not only addresses the growing demand for skilled professionals but also ensures access and equity in shaping the future of digital security. By creating new scholarship opportunities, it enables students to pursue advanced academic achievements, empowering the next generation of cybersecurity innovators."   
  
“Old Dominion University has worked tirelessly to advance educational programs and professional opportunities in this important area. It is a critical need in the Commonwealth and across the nation. On behalf of our current and future students, we deeply appreciate Congressman Connolly’s leadership and support in this area, especially the possibilities associated with the CyberCorps Enhancement Act. We look forward to being an active partner in this continued journey to meet the evolving needs of business and industry in this dynamic and ever-changing area,”  said Brian O. Hemphill, PhD, President of Old Dominion University.

10:40:55 root         DEBUG    Titles: Connolly Statement on President Biden's Cybersecurity Executive Order
10:40:55 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:40:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA), the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released the following statement on the Biden administration's recently released  Executive Order  on Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity:   
  
"The Biden administration’s recently issued executive order (EO) is a capstone on four years of prolific and decisive action on cybersecurity. The United States faces continued threats to government systems and critical infrastructure from both nation state threats and criminal actors. The People’s Republic of China’s recent attacks on the Treasury Department and critical telecommunications systems show that cybersecurity threats pose a clear and present danger. The EO explicitly acknowledges the threat of the People’s Republic of China’s advanced and persistent threat. I commend the Biden-Harris Administration’s attention to combatting China’s gray zone tactics and the attention to securing American technology.   
  
The EO demonstrates the Biden administration’s commitment to developing real, actionable threat mitigations by proposing concrete policy solutions. New rules for supply chain security, secure by design principles, end-to-end encryption, future proof post-quantum encryption standards, and standards development and implementation requirements show a whole-of-government approach to tackling key cyber vulnerabilities. Specifically, the administration’s mandate for updated FedRAMP requirements concerning cryptographic key management security practices will help improve the security of Federal Government communications against adversarial nations and criminals. I commend the administration’s EO for highlighting the FedRAMP program’s role in improving the cybersecurity of federal systems and securing federal communications. As author of the FedRAMP Authorization Act, I am committed to improving the program and ensuring it enforces and enables robust security across federal cloud service adoption.   
  
The Oversight Committee must work to build on the substantial cybersecurity accomplishments of the Biden Administration. The President’s actions on cybersecurity should serve as a wakeup call to invest in better software practices and to codify key provisions of this EO into law. I have long advocated for federal information technology to better serve the American people, and I encourage the incoming Administration to work with Congress to ensure a government-wide commitment to cybersecurity."

10:40:56 root         DEBUG    Titles: Ranking Member Connolly, Senator Kaine, and Representatives Mfume, Fitzpatrick, Bacon Reintroduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect the Civil Service from Politicization
10:40:56 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:40:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  , along with  Rep  s  . Kweisi Mfume  ,  Brian Fitzpatrick  ,  and Don Bacon  ,  reintroduced the  Saving the Civil Service Act  to protect the federal workforce from politicization and political manipulation. The bipartisan legislation includes and builds on Ranking Member Connolly and Rep. Fitzpatrick’s Preventing a Patronage System Act, which passed the House in September 2022. Ranking Member Connolly  ,  Rep. Fitzpa  trick, and Sen. Kaine  previously introduced the legislation in the 118th Congress.  Senator Tim Kaine introduced companion legislation in the  U.S. Sen  ate.   
  
“The civil servants who make up our federal workforce are the engine that keeps our federal government running,” said Ranking Member Connolly. “They are our country’s greatest asset. We rely on their experience and expertise to provide every basic government service—from delivering the mail to helping families in the wake of natural disasters. The President-elect’s promise to remove qualified experts and replace them with political loyalists is a direct threat to our national security and our government’s ability to function the way the American people expect it to. It threatens to create a system wherein benefits and services are delivered based on the politics, not the needs, of the recipient. Expertise, not political fealty, must define our civil service.”   
  
“Every day, our nation’s federal employees go to work for the American people to administer Social Security, Medicare, and veterans’ benefits, protect our national security, and provide other critical services to communities across our country,” said Sen. Kaine. “We must ensure our federal workers continue to be hired based on their expertise and experience, not their political party. I’m concerned by the President-elect’s proposed plans to target the federal workforce, and I will keep working with my colleagues to pass this legislation to protect the merit-based federal civil service system.”   
  
“An attack on our nation’s federal workforce is not only an attack on public servants and their families, but it is also an assault on the ability of the federal government to efficiently and effectively provide critical governmental services to citizens. The bipartisan legislation we introduced today would protect hardworking federal employees from the ‘pendulum swings’ of electoral politics,” said Rep. Mfume. “The fact that this bill is supported by Members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle is an indication of the seriousness and substance of the threats being made against our friends and neighbors devoted to civil service, and signals the urgency by which we must act to protect our federal workers.”   
  
“When our nation’s federal civil servants take their oath, their duty is to the American people—not political parties or partisan agendas,” said Rep. Fitzpatrick. “Our bipartisan Saving the Civil Service Act is about protecting what makes our government work: integrity, fairness, and accountability. By upholding a merit-based hiring system, we ensure that federal employment serves one purpose—to deliver effective and efficient service to the people, free from the shadow of political interference.”   
  
“Our civil service employees perform research and analysis that is valuable to Congress, and we need to protect them from being unilaterally terminated just because they may be at conflict with any Administration in charge-Republican or Democrat,” said Rep. Bacon. “While it is prudent to look at numbers of civilian employees, we should not strip them of due process and their civil service protections without the express permission of Congress.”   
  
On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted service. This executive order would undermine the merit system principles of our federal workforce by requiring agency heads to reclassify “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that removes their due process rights and civil service protections.   
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act would ensure the civil service system cannot be politically manipulated by: 

  * Preventing any position in the federal competitive service created after September 30, 2020, from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. 
  * Installing a cap on the number of conversions to the frozen excepted service schedule (Schedule C). The cap cannot exceed more than 1% of the total number of employees at such agency as of the first day of such term, or five employees, whichever is greater. 
  * Requiring that anyone who is converted provide consent for that conversion, and a report to Congress on any conversions. 

  
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act is cosponsored by the following Senators: Markey, Whitehouse, Van Hollen, Murray Shaheen, King, Duckworth, Wyden, Schatz, Hickenlooper, Fetterman, Hirono, Warner, Sanders, Padilla, Alsobrooks.   
  
The Saving the Civil Service Act is endorsed by the following organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the Federal Managers Association (FMA), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).

10:40:57 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:40:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, reintroduced the  Equal COLA Act  . The legislation aims to bring equity to the way the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is determined under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Ranking Member Connolly previously introduced the legislation in the 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses.   
  
“Federal retirees served our country with patriotism and honor, regardless of which retirement system they fall under,” said Ranking Member Connolly. “The economic conditions that necessitate cost-of-living adjustments affect retirees in the same way, whether they are on CSRS or FERS. It is high time we recognized that reality. The Equal COLA Act will rectify the unfair two-tiered process we have in place now and will bring parity to a federal retirement system that has unjustly penalized certain retirees for too long.”    
  
The Equal COLA Act would make the annual COLA for both the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) equivalent to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This change would institute long-overdue parity between the two federal retirement systems and result in a more just retirement benefits system for all federal workers.   
  
The Equal COLA Act is cosponsored by the following Members of Congress: Mullin, Tlaib, Brownley, Boyle, Cleaver, Don Davis, McBath, DelBene, Frost, Cohen, Leger Fernandez, Mrvan, Thanedar, Titus, Cherfilus-McCormick, Raskin, McClellan, Casar, Danny Davis, Ocasio-Cortez, Garamendi, Salinas, Lynch, Goldman, Hoyle, Takano.   
  
The Equal COLA Act is endorsed by the following organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the Federal Managers Association (FMA), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).

10:40:57 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:40:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Senator Brian Schatz  reintroduced the  Federal Adjustment of Income Rates (FAIR) Act  ,  a bill that would provide federal employees with a 4.3% pay increase in calendar year 2026. Ranking Member Connolly and Sen. Schatz previously introduced similar legislation in the 115th, 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses.   
  
“The federal workforce is our country’s single greatest asset,” said Ranking Member Connolly. “Even after serving dutifully through a global pandemic and enduring the Trump Administration’s cruel personal attacks, unsafe work environments, pay freezes, government shutdowns, sequestration cuts, furloughs, and mindless across-the-board hiring freezes, they come to work every day in service to the American people. As we prepare for another Trump Administration and its impact on our civil servants, it is only right that they be compensated fairly.”   
  
“Whether it’s inspecting our food, conducting medical research, or caring for veterans, federal workers play an important role in our daily lives and deserve pay that reflects that,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill boosts wages to keep public service jobs competitive with those in the private sector and maintain a strong and talented federal workforce.”   
  
The federal government has a history of chronic underinvestment in its most valuable asset: the federal workforce. Federal employees have had to endure government shutdowns, pay freezes, hiring freezes, and lost pay as a result of sequestration-related furloughs.   
  
According to the  Federal Salary Council  , Federal employees on average earned 24.72% less in 2024 than their counterparts in the private sector. In addition, the 2024 Office of Personnel Management’s  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey  governmentwide management report found that pay satisfaction rests at 59% compared to 67% in 2020. A lack of competitive pay hurts the recruitment, retention, and quality of the civil service, which in turn affects the dissemination of essential services across the country.   
  
The Biden Administration has worked to reverse these trends, providing federal employees a 4.6% pay raise in 2023, a 5.2% pay raise in 2024, and a 2% pay raise in 2025. Nonetheless, federal employee pay increases have failed to keep pace with rising labor and living costs. The FAIR Act’s wage adjustment restores years of lost wage increases for federal employees by ensuring that federal employees, who serve in every state and territory on behalf of constituents in every congressional district, earn an average pay increase of 4.3%.   
  
The FAIR Act is cosponsored by the following Members of Congress: Norton, Summer Lee, Subramanyam, Lynch, Beyer.   
  
The FAIR Act is endorsed by the following organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the Federal Managers Association (FMA), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).

10:41:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: Fire departments wait over a year to be paid back after responding to fires on federal lands 

This critical legislation addresses a  key recommendation in the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Report  (link is external)  on fighting the wildfire crisis 

WASHINGTON  – Today, Rep.  Josh Harder (CA-09)  introduced his first bill of the 119th Congress, the bipartisan  Fire Department Repayment Act  with  Rep. Doug LaMalfa (CA-01)  to ensure local departments are fairly and quickly compensated for fighting fires on federal lands. 

In part due to a shortage of wildland firefighters, local fire departments are often asked to respond to fires on federal lands, which can be very costly between staff pay and equipment costs. As firefighters — including dozens from the Valley — fight wildfires in Southern California, Harder is working across the aisle to get local fire departments the funding they need to keep families safe. 

“As the wildfire crisis keeps getting longer and more severe, local firefighters are being asked to do more and more dangerous work to keep our families safe,” said  Rep.  Harder  . “When fires break out on federal land, local firefighters answer the call, whether or not they were reimbursed for the last fire. The federal government should be making it easier for firefighters to do their jobs, not skipping out on the bill. This legislation forces the federal government to do the right thing and get our fire departments paid ASAP.” 

“Our local firefighters are out there risking their lives every day to protect us from increasingly severe wildfires, and it’s time the federal government holds up its end of the bargain,” said  Rep. LaMalfa  . “Fire departments shouldn’t have to chase down reimbursement for their critical work on federal lands. This legislation guarantees they’re compensated promptly, so they can continue their essential work without worrying about when they’ll get paid.” 

This continues Rep. Harder’s work to  support firefighters  and  address the wildfire crisis  . 

Rep. Harder’s  Fire Department Repayment Act  ensures that the agreements local fire departments enter with the federal government are completed more transparently and in a timely manner, helping give fire departments clarity about when and how much they will be reimbursed for wildfire costs. Specifically, the bill: 

  * Establishes standard operating procedures for fire suppression costs agreements; 
  * Reviews and modifies fire suppression costs agreements as necessary; 
  * Ensures the fire suppression costs agreements align with cooperative fire protection agreements; and 
  * Expedites reviews of standard operating procedures.

10:41:04 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) in reintroducing legislation to provide increased oversight and accountability into presidential inaugural committees. The  Inaugural Committee Transparency Act  would require public disclosure of how presidential inaugural committees spend the millions of dollars they raise and help prevent the misuse of committee funds. 

“We have seen nearly 200 million dollars in donations from billionaires and corporations flood into Washington to fund the upcoming inauguration,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “The American people deserve to know how these funds are being spent and exactly who they come from. The inauguration of a president from any party should not be used as an opportunity for personal enrichment or cronyism. My legislation will ensure that inaugural committees are held to appropriate standards of transparency and accountability.” 

Senator Cortez Masto  first introduced  this legislation following reports that President Donald Trump’s first inaugural committee—which raised nearly $107 million—misused funds, and she has reintroduced it every Congress. 

Under current law, there are few rules that govern inaugural committees. Donations to the committee of $200 or more must be disclosed 90 days after the inaugural period, but there are no disclosure requirements for committee expenditures. Additionally, there are no reporting requirements on how leftover funds are used after the inaugural period. Specifically, the  Inaugural Committee Transparency Act  would: 

  * Require an inaugural committee to disclose to the FEC the name and address of every person to whom any disbursement of $200 or more is made and the purpose of the disbursement; 
  * Prohibit donations on behalf of another person; 
  * Prohibit converting donations to personal use; 
  * Require that any remaining funds be donated within 90 days of the inaugural ceremony to a 501(c)(3) charity. 



The legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).  The full text of the legislation can be found  here  .

10:41:05 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:41:05 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Jamie Raskin (both D-Md.) reintroduced their Handgun Permit to Purchase Act, legislation to expand adoption of state and local permit-to-purchase gun safety laws. The lawmakers’ bill creates an incentive for state and local governments to implement laws that require individuals to obtain a license before purchasing a handgun. This introduction comes after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week declined to hear a challenge to Maryland’s 2013 Handgun Qualification Licensing Law – leaving in place a lower court ruling that affirmed its constitutionality. Maryland’s law is a prime example of a common-sense firearm safety measure that the Handgun Permit to Purchase Act is designed to incentivize in other states across the country. 

In the Senate, this legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy (both D-Conn.). In the House, it is cosponsored by Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.). 

“Too many families, loved ones, and communities across America have had their lives forever scarred by the epidemic of gun violence gripping our nation. Permit-to-purchase laws have been proven to reduce gun violence and help keep firearms out of dangerous hands, and Maryland’s handgun licensing law demonstrates that we can take steps to address gun violence while protecting Americans’ rights. States require licenses to drive a car in order to protect public safety – requiring a license to buy a handgun should be a no-brainer,”  said Senator Van Hollen, who first introduced this legislation in 2015. 

“Our government shatters our social contract when our people can’t shop, pray and learn without being fearful of being shot down in random acts of gun violence,”  said Rep. Raskin.  “The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act builds on a law I helped pass in Maryland by incentivizing more states to implement laws that require people to obtain a license before purchasing a handgun—a commonsense safeguard most Americans support. I’m grateful to Senator Van Hollen and Rep. Hayes for their commitment to passing this legislation and other commonsense gun safety reforms.” 

“Adopting nationally my state’s handgun permit law, which has saved lives and reduced crime, will prevent senseless gun violence tragedies. Licenses are required in every state to drive a car, and should be for handguns too, which can kill even more readily. Commonsense reforms like the Handgun Permit to Purchase Act are desperately needed to curb the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our nation and to make our communities safer,”  said Senator Blumenthal. 

“Connecticut’s permit-to-purchase law led to a huge drop in gun homicides and has undoubtedly saved lives. This legislation would encourage other states to follow suit and adopt laws that require a license to purchase a handgun. It’s a proven way to keep guns out of dangerous hands,”  said Senator Murphy. 

The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act creates a federal grant program to incentivize state and local governments nationwide to enact laws requiring individuals to obtain a license from law enforcement before purchasing a handgun. While details of these laws may vary, a grant recipient’s PTP law must, at a minimum, require prospective handgun owners to: apply for a permit from a state-designated law enforcement agency; submit to a background check to ensure they are not barred by federal law from possessing firearms; and be 21 or older. The PTP law must also require licensed individuals to renew their handgun permits within five years. 14 states – including Maryland and Connecticut – as well as the District of Columbia have laws that require a license prior to the purchase of a handgun. 

Text of the bill can be viewed  here  . 

The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act is supported by  Brady: United Against Gun Violence, Giffords, March for Our Lives, and Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence. 

“States that require permits to purchase handguns consistently experience lower levels of gun violence than those that do not and are far less likely to be the sources of firearms diverted to the illegal market. Incentivizing these systems in states would play an outsized role in ending the epidemic of gun violence and save countless lives. Brady is proud to endorse the Handgun Permit to Purchase Act and thanks Sen. Van Hollen and Rep. Raskin for reintroducing this important legislation,”  said Mark Collins, Director of Federal Policy at Brady. 

“Too many lives have been lost due to weak gun laws that allow firearms to fall into the wrong hands. The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act takes a critical step toward addressing this by ensuring that common-sense protections, like background checks, take place before a buyer even steps foot in a gun store. We applaud Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Raskin for pushing this critical legislation forward and for their steadfast commitment to reducing gun violence and improving public safety,”  Vanessa Gonzalez, Vice President of Government & Political Affairs at GIFFORDS. 

“The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act is a massive step forward in keeping young people and communities safe,”  said Elena Perez, Senior Policy Associate at March for Our Lives.  “Permit-to-purchase laws have shown to be effective across the country, time and time again, at reducing firearm homicides. At a time when guns continue to be the leading cause of death for children and young people, this bill is all the more important. March For Our Lives is proud to stand with Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Raskin as they reintroduce this vital piece of legislation and we thank them for his dedication to fighting this gun violence epidemic.” 

“Maryland’s handgun permit law has proven to be a vital tool in reducing gun violence and keeping our communities safer. Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Raskin’s Handgun Permit to Purchase Act would extend these proven strategies nationwide, empowering states to implement common-sense licensing policies that save lives. Research consistently shows that permit-to-purchase laws are effective in preventing firearms from falling into dangerous hands, and we fully support this critical step toward a safer America,”  said Karen Herren, Executive Director of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence.

10:41:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) in introducing bipartisan legislation, along with Senators John Kennedy (R-La.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), to provide relief for impacted taxpayers in states that have issued state-level disaster declarations. Currently, the IRS has the authority to postpone filing deadlines in the event of a presidentially-declared federal disaster, but this does not extend to state-level emergencies. Representatives David Kustoff (R-Tenn.-08) and Judy Chu (D-Calif.-28) have introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

“When disaster strikes, the burden families face on the long road to recovery is overwhelming. This bipartisan bill provides financial flexibility for Americans impacted by disaster so they can focus on rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,”  said Senator Van Hollen  . 

“Nevadans experiencing natural disasters deserve tax relief, regardless of whether the state receives a federally recognized disaster declaration,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “My bipartisan, bicameral bill would ensure that Nevada taxpayers impacted by wildfires, winter storms, floods, and more have the financial flexibility they need to recover.” 

“Louisianians have worked tirelessly to rebuild after historic storms took their toll, so giving them the time they need to file taxes after a natural disaster is a no-brainer. Since Louisiana can’t always rely on Washington to get us the relief we need when we need it, this bill would make sure that Louisianians get tax extensions that are crucial for recovering after our state declares a natural disaster. I’m glad to partner again with Sen. Cortez Masto on this effort,”  said Senator Kennedy  . 

“When a disaster like Hurricane Helene hits, the last thing Tennesseans should have to worry about is meeting a tax-filing deadline,”  said Senator Blackburn.  “The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act empowers the governor to extend tax deadlines, giving Tennesseans the flexibility to focus on disaster recovery.” 

The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act would allow the governor of a state or territory to extend a federal tax filing deadline in the event of a state-declared emergency or disaster, which happens automatically for federally-declared disasters. Extending this authority to states gives them the ability to provide relief independent of the federal government’s involvement in an emergency or natural disaster. The legislation would also expand the mandatory federal filing extension from 60 days to 120 days.

10:41:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Tim Sheehy (D-Mont.) introduced the VA Home Loan Awareness Act to help more veterans take advantage of the VA Home Loan program and achieve home ownership. 

“After serving our country in uniform, our veterans deserve the support of a grateful nation. The VA Home Loan Program is one way we provide that support – by helping veterans purchase homes. But far too many of our veterans are unaware of this program and what it has to offer. Our bipartisan bill will help ensure more veterans and their families have the opportunity to use it to achieve their goal of homeownership,”  said Senator Van Hollen. 

“For decades, owning a home has been the bedrock of the American Dream, but too often, those who have put their lives on the line for our country have been hampered by a lack of information from their own government. I’m proud to join Senator Van Hollen and my other colleagues in introducing this commonsense measure to empower our veterans with the knowledge and resources necessary to secure a VA Home Loan and achieve the same dream they fought to defend,”  said Senator Sheehy. 

Background 

The VA Home Loan program is a key tool for helping veterans and their spouses achieve the American dream. It offers veterans no down payment, no private mortgage insurance, and interest rates that are often lower than rates for conventional FHA loans. Despite these benefits, only 13 percent of veterans access the VA Home Loan program. Among veterans who don’t use the VA Home Loan program, 33 percent say they are not aware of the program. 

The VA Home Loan Awareness Act will help better inform veterans of opportunities provided by the VA Home Loan program by adding a disclosure to the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) informing veterans they may be eligible for a VA Home Loan, directing applicants to consult their lender for more information about the VA Home Loan program, and instructing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a review and report to Congress on lenders’ adoption of these URLA updates.

These resources will help the school provide quality medical training to around 180 students annually and enhance their clinical skills. This funding comes amid the  critical shortage of physicians in Western Maryland,  which is negatively impacting health care access for residents across the region. 

Western Maryland Health Care Corporation has been awarded $450,000 to renovate a recently acquired 8,000-square-foot facility in Grantsville to serve as the new location of the Mountain Laurel Medical Center. The new center will include a community pharmacy and diagnostic imaging services, and allow for increased health appointment availability. This project will enhance access to medical care for an estimated 2,500 patients in Western Maryland annually. 

“Every Marylander deserves access to high-quality health care, but too often needed care can be hard to reach in our Western Maryland communities. These federal investments will help address critical health care challenges in Western Maryland and improve health care options available to residents for years to come,”  said Senator Van Hollen. 

“Every single Marylander across our state deserves access to high-quality and accessible health care,”  said Senator Alsobrooks.  “In Western Maryland communities, we are committed to increasing that access, and this federal investment is an important step towards that goal. It will have a far-reaching and long-lasting impact on the region.” 

“Increasing affordable, accessible health care in our rural communities is crucial to driving better health outcomes in Western Maryland. This federal funding will go a long way in addressing our physician shortage and expanding and empowering our local health centers. Investment equals impact, and I look forward to working with local, state, and federal partners to continue delivering much-need resources to our rural communities,”  said Congresswoman McClain Delaney. 

This investment is provided through the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development agency of the federal government and 13 state governments focusing on 423 counties across the Appalachian region. The lawmakers support robust funding of the program in order to invest in critical projects across Western Maryland.

10:41:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) urged President Joe Biden to trigger the 90-day extension in the Protection Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to allow ByteDance additional time to divest from TikTok before facing a ban in the United States. 

In the letter, the Senators write  , “Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok. A shutdown would be especially painful for creators in California who have been using the platform to share their stories and find resources during the tragic wildfires around Los Angeles. With Senate Republicans blocking legislation introduced this week to extend the TikTok divest-or-ban deadline and the Supreme Court, by all accounts, appearing unlikely to come to TikTok’s aid, your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday.”

Dear President Biden, 

We write to urge you to trigger the 90-day extension in the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act to allow ByteDance additional time to divest TikTok before facing a ban in the United States.1 Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok.2 A shutdown would be especially painful for creators in California who have been using the platform to share their stories and find resources during the tragic wildfires around Los Angeles. With Senate Republicans blocking legislation introduced this week to extend the TikTok divest-or-ban deadline3 and the Supreme Court, by all accounts, appearing unlikely to come to TikTok’s aid,4 your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday. We therefore urge you to act swiftly to trigger the 90-day extension. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.

10:41:10 root         DEBUG    Titles: In Wake of California's Wildfires, Van Hollen, Wyden, and Colleagues Call on Treasury Department to Swiftly Publish Data about Impact of Climate Crisis on Homeowners Insurance
10:41:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:41:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and six of their Senate colleagues urged the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to immediately publish data and analysis about how the climate crisis impacts homeowners insurance nationwide. They were joined in sending the letter by Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). They also called for the data to be shared with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which includes key federal and state financial regulators whose decisions about housing and insurance policy could be shaped by insights from this data. 

In the letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and FIO Director Steven Seitz,  the senators underscored,  “Gathering this data is important because natural disasters made worse by climate change are squeezing homeowners and insurance companies nationwide. Public access to this data can help us better understand this crisis of affordability and availability.” 

Making information public about the homeowners insurance market, including premium and rate increases and market withdrawals, would ensure Congress, FSOC, researchers, policymakers, and the public are better prepared for future climate-related risks. Also, publishing and examining this data is critical to understanding the growing crisis of homeowners insurance being less affordable and accessible. Families and communities nationwide, including those in regions that are less vulnerable to climate-related disasters, are increasingly struggling to afford or even access home insurance. 

The senators stressed,  “Failing to publish this data will prevent informed decisions and implementation of impactful policy changes that can help communities and households live and grow in a more climate-resilient manner. Piecemeal data kept privately will not aid our efforts to address the growing national issue of homeowner insurance availability and affordability, especially as disparate policies and climate events throughout the country have devastated communities and will continue to do so.” 

“Homeowners need this data to understand how much climate change is going to increase their insurance costs. Policymakers need the data to hold insurers accountable and to chart a more resilient path forward,”  said Kelsey Condon, Policy Counsel for Climate Finance at Americans for Financial Reform.  “Right now, insurers are dropping long-time customers left and right and people need to know if it's going to happen to them next. There is no reason the government should be withholding this information from the public and we hope that the Treasury Department seizes this closing window of opportunity.” 

The letter text is available  here  and below: 

Dear Secretary Yellen and Director Seitz: 

Thank you for leading the property and casualty market data call to collect nationwide zip codelevel data on homeowners insurance. Gathering this data is important because natural disasters made worse by climate change are squeezing homeowners and insurance companies nationwide. Public access to this data can help us better understand this crisis of affordability and availability. We urge you to make this data public immediately, and to share the data with all members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to ensure the FSOC is prepared to respond to climate-related risks in the home insurance market. Publishing this aggregated, de-identified data will inform Congress, our constituents and other policymakers about changes in the home insurance market and help us all prepare for future climate impacts. 

This data, and the Federal Insurance Office’s (FIO) assessment of this data, are both essential to understanding the growing crisis of home insurance affordability and access. Families and communities across the country are struggling, even in areas with relatively low climate vulnerability, to find home insurance coverage that’s affordable–or that’s offered at all. But understanding and responding to consumer- and insurer-level risk and exposure in order to mitigate these issues is impossible without national, state, and local level data. The data needed for this analysis — the data collected by FIO under its unique statutory mandate to monitor issues in the insurance market that could present systemic risk or prevent underserved consumers from accessing insurance— is not available anywhere else. To this end, we request that you immediately: 

1\. Publicly release the anonymized data in as close to the same format and with the same detail as collected by FIO, to the extent legally possible;   
2\. Share this data with all FSOC member agencies, and to any state and federal agencies that request this information, in compliance with any state and federal confidentiality requirements; and 3. Promptly publish FIO’s initial analysis of the data regarding the climate impacts on homeowners insurance affordability and availability. 

If Treasury and FIO fail to publish even an analysis of this data, consumers and local governments will continue to lack the information they need to identify trends and factors driving the cost of home insurance. Failing to publish this data will prevent informed decisions and implementation of impactful policy changes that can help communities and households live and grow in a more climate-resilient manner. Piecemeal data kept privately will not aid our efforts to address the growing national issue of homeowner insurance availability and affordability, especially as disparate policies and climate events throughout the country have devastated communities and will continue to do so. 

To protect our constituents, and the financial stability of the insurance markets and state and local governments, the public, researchers, advocates, and policymakers must have access to this data. The Federal Insurance Office was created, and is uniquely able, to provide this benefit to the public. Please do not let this data call go to waste. 

Sincerely,

10:41:11 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:41:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Congresswoman April McClain Delaney (all D-Md.) announced $11,259,000 in federal funding to upgrade the Town of Grantsville's wastewater treatment plant. This investment, comprised of a $9,989,000 grant and a $1,270,000 loan, will help the plant meet current and future permit standards set by the Maryland Department of the Environment; connecting to approximately 590 homes in Grantsville and the neighboring communities of Jennings, Chestnut Ridge, and the Goodwill Retirement Community in Garrett County. 

“Wastewater treatment infrastructure is essential for protecting the health and safety of Marylanders and our environment. This federal funding will support much-needed upgrades to ensure the Grantsville treatment plant is well-equipped to serve the needs of the town and its surrounding communities for years to come,”  said Senator Van Hollen. 

“We need modern, up-to-date wastewater treatment centers in order to have healthy Marylanders,”  said Senator Alsobrooks.  “That’s why getting this kind of federal investment to the Town of Grantsville’s wastewater treatment plant is critical, and I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Van Hollen and Congresswoman McLain Delaney to deliver for Garrett County.” 

“The health and effectiveness of our wastewater treatment plants is critical infrastructure that we must not take for granted. I’m glad to join my colleagues in delivering this funding to upgrade the Grantsville treatment plant and provide safe, clean water access to hundreds of Marylanders in Garrett County,”  said Congresswoman McClain Delaney. 

The federal funding is provided through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants Program, which the lawmakers support robust investment in, in order to help modernize water infrastructure across our communities.

10:41:13 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:41:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and 19 other Senators in introducing a  resolution  honoring the service of women in combat roles in the U.S. Armed Forces. The resolution comes as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense (DoD), Pete Hegseth, continues to face scorching criticism for, among many other things, his  long  record  of  denigrating  women  servicemembers who bravely serve our nation in combat roles. The resolution can be viewed  here  . 

Joining Senators Van Hollen, Murray and Duckworth in introducing the resolution today were Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). 

“The hundreds of thousands of women serving our nation across every branch of the military are an integral part of our country’s defense, and they deserve our support and gratitude. They do not deserve to have their sacrifices diminished or their ability to protect our country questioned, especially not by those who seek to lead them. Women in combat roles put their lives on the line every day to stand up for America — America needs to stand with them in return,”  said Senator Van Hollen. 

“Every single day, women in our Armed Forces put their lives on the line to defend our nation. Meanwhile, Pete Hegseth has spent decades denigrating the role of women in the military in ways that simply don’t square with the reality of the real and needed contributions women servicemembers are making today, including in combat—his very recent about-face on this topic is simply not convincing. The contributions of our women servicemembers, their courage, and the immense sacrifices they make to keep us safe should never be questioned or demeaned—especially not by someone under consideration to lead the Department of Defense,”  said Senator Murray  . “I am proud to lead this resolution with my friend Senator Duckworth to send a strong message to every woman who bravely serves our nation in combat: we stand with you, we celebrate you, and our nation is forever grateful for your service.” 

“Contrary to what Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly, women have always made our military stronger and are more qualified to serve in their roles than Pete Hegseth is to serve as Secretary of Defense,”  said Senator Duckworth.  “There is no U.S. military as we know it without the incredible women who have earned their places in their units by going through the same rigorous physical testing and training that men do. I’m proud to co-lead this resolution with Senator Murray to honor our women warriors and make clear that any nominee who doesn’t understand the essential value of female servicemembers is not qualified to lead our military.” 

The Senators’ resolution “recognizes the contribution, bravery, and sacrifices of women serving in combat roles in the Armed Forces; and encourages the continued celebration of the achievements of women in the Armed Forces to inspire future generations,” noting specifically that: 

  * Women have honorably served in the Armed Services with distinction since the Revolutionary War; 
  * The Department of Defense announced the opening of all military occupations and specialties to women in December 2015; 
  * Women have received numerous commendations for their service in combat after September 2001, including Bronze Stars and Silver Stars; 
  * Since September 11, approximately 3,000 women have earned Combat Action Badges and Combat Action Ribbons; 
  * Women in the military serve in special forces units, including as Army Rangers, Air Force Special Operators, and in the Marine Corps Special Operations Command. 



“Across the country, women in uniform make incredible sacrifices to defend our freedoms. They deserve to be recognized for their brave service regardless of who leads the Department of Defense,”  said Senator Bennet.  “I’m glad to join my colleagues on this important resolution to honor women in combat roles for their critical contributions to our national security and military readiness.” 

“The brave women of our Armed Forces make sacrifices every day in service to our nation, and they deserve recognition and honor for their tireless commitment to protecting our country. Their heroism, courage, and strength serve as a model for all Americans. Pete Hegseth’s attitude of disrespect towards women in our military discredits not only the capability of women servicemembers, but also of our nation’s military strength as a whole. This resolution rightfully recognizes the contributions of our nation’s women servicemembers to our national security and acts as a message of solidarity to the brave women dedicated to defending our country,”  said Senator Blumenthal. 

“Our military is made up of dedicated service members, including women serving in combat roles, who risk their lives for our country. To disparage the commitment and sacrifice of women serving in our Armed Forces is upsetting and unbecoming of a potential leader of our nation’s military,”  said Senator Durbin.  “Because Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth refuses to acknowledge the sacrifices of women in the military, I hope this resolution makes it clear that our nation is proud of and grateful for the women who have volunteered to serve our country in uniform.” 

“Thousands of brave women serve in our armed forces, making the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, protect our national security, and keep us safe,”  said Senator Hirono.  “Pete Hegseth lacks the understanding of how crucial these women are to our military. Our female servicemembers deserve a Secretary of Defense who does not undermine and disparage them or their contributions. I am proud to cosponsor this important resolution, to honor every woman who serves our nation in combat roles.” 

“The women who are bravely serving our nation in combat deserve nothing less than our utmost respect and appreciation. This resolution is a symbol of our country’s eternal gratitude for their dedication and service,”  said Senator Rosen.  “No one who denigrates women’s service in combat has any place leading the Pentagon, which is why I’ll continue to strongly oppose Pete Hegseth’s nomination for Secretary of Defense.” 

“Women have made extraordinary sacrifices over the years to serve our country in combat. Time and again, they’ve put themselves in grave danger to defend our values and freedoms, and they – along with their loved ones – deserve our gratitude and respect,”  said Senator Schatz. 

“With nearly 400,000 women serving in our military, and data showing fewer separations between the roles that they serve in, it's as clear as ever that women are a critical part of our military – including in combat roles,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “I'm proud to be a part of this resolution expressing our profound gratitude to the women who risked everything to protect our freedoms.” 

“The U.S. military is the best in the world and the contributions of our women servicemembers play a key role in that success. They put themselves in harm’s way and make enormous sacrifices to defend all of us and our national security,”  said Senator Smith.  “Women in combat deserve recognition, and I am proud to cosponsor this resolution that does just that.” 

“Proud, determined, and skilled women serve our country every day and have been doing so since America’s founding,”  Senator Wyden said.  “This nominee has denigrated women in all areas of his life. To put him in charge of women who choose to put their lives at risk for our nation is an insult to them, their families, and America. These women are more honorable than Pete Hegseth has ever been. I commend Senators Murray and Duckworth for leading this resolution that salutes all the women who have served our nation. Let’s show them the dignity, honor, and respect they have always deserved.”

10:41:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:41:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Angus I. King (I-Maine), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) unveiled an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  to improve the ability of the legislation to protect our communities. 

This amendment would ensure that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers can use their limited time and detention facilities to detain truly dangerous individuals who pose an immediate risk to the public. The senators’ amendment would help improve the  Laken Riley Act  by ensuring that only those undocumented individuals who are found guilty of a crime—or have been charged with, or arrested for, a crime and failed to appear for court appointments—will be detained under this bill. 

“We must keep our communities safe and prioritize the detention of violent offenders. I support Senator Kaine’s amendment because it directly addresses the circumstances that led to the terrible murder of Laken Riley, without creating a system that diverts resources away from the detention of violent offenders. If Republicans are serious about working with us to improve public safety, they will help ensure this amendment – which would improve the bill significantly – is considered and passed,”  said Van Hollen. 

“My thoughts are with Laken Riley’s family in the wake of her horrific murder. Americans have a right to be safe in their communities and—for many reasons—deserve commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system,”  said Kaine  . “But in its current form, I have serious concerns that the  Laken Riley Act  —which did not receive a single hearing or vote from its committee of jurisdiction in the Senate—will burden our law enforcement officers in a way that will make it impossible to get truly dangerous individuals off the street and ultimately make Virginians less safe. I’m glad to have worked with my colleagues on this amendment to try to fix that, and urge Senate leadership to put it up for a vote.” 

“The murder of Laken Riley was horrific, and my prayers are with her family and loved ones. I have always been supportive of immigration policies that are tough, fair, and keep Americans safe. It's why I voted for the bipartisan border security agreement last year,”  said Luján  . “But this legislation as it stands would divert resources from serious threats, risk abuse by the incoming administration, endanger DACA holders, and cost American taxpayers billions. That’s why I’m joining my colleagues to introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill, and I urge Senate leadership to consider it for a vote.” 

“Mandatory lockup of adults who are convicted of a crime and pose a threat to the community or a flight risk makes a lot of sense. But mandatory lockups of children accused of minor offenses? Permanent imprisonment of kids accused of stealing lollipops? This is twisted. And super damaging to the children. The Kaine amendment strikes the right balance for community safety,”  said Merkley. 

“Laken Riley’s tragic murder should never have occurred, and while our thoughts continue to be with her loved ones, the Laken Riley Act is a bipartisan attempt to help prevent future tragedies. For too long, Congress has failed to address our broken immigration system and border security. I was deeply disappointed when last year’s bipartisan border security agreement failed because it would have increased protections at the border and stemmed the flow of fentanyl into the United States. That’s why I voted to proceed with consideration of the Laken Riley Act and why I’m proud to help introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill. Our amendment would improve our enforcement mechanisms to better ensure we can keep offenders off the streets and strengthen public safety,”  said Shaheen  . 

“Laken Riley should be here today, and my heart goes out to her family and loved ones. It’s clear that we need to take steps to reform our broken immigration system — and that includes enforcement,”  said Warner.  “I’m proud to introduce this amendment to help strengthen public safety and improve the Laken Riley Act to make sure we dedicate our resources to getting dangerous individuals off our streets.” 

“Laken Riley’s murder was heartbreaking, and my thoughts go out to her family and loved ones. Democrats believe we need serious reform on immigration, and that includes enforcement. But this bill has significant problems, and that’s why we’re partnering together to bring commonsense, pragmatic changes through the amendment process. This bill, in its current form, includes no requirement that a person be convicted of a property offense before they are held indefinitely, which diminishes due process. It grants unprecedented power to state attorneys general to control our immigration system and threatens to overwhelm our federal courts. And it also puts children in danger of mandatory detention,”  said Welch.  “I believe our amendment to fix the issues outlined is fair and strengthens the  Laken Riley Act  . It should earn quick bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues in Senate Leadership to bring it up for a vote on the Senate floor.”

10:41:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding the deal reached between Israel and Hamas to release the hostages and establish a ceasefire in Gaza. 

“On October 7, 2023 Hamas murdered over 1,200 people, seized over 250 hostages, and committed acts of sexual violence. This heinous terrorist attack – and the bloodshed it caused – will forever scar both the Israeli people and the people of our nation. We will never forget the lives taken that day – and those of the hostages who have been murdered since. This war has also claimed the lives of more than 46,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, and resulted in an ongoing humanitarian disaster that has left hundreds of thousands on the brink of starvation, vulnerable to disease, and without homes and access to basic necessities like medicine and clean water. 

“I’ve met with the families of hostages both here and in Israel. I have also met with Israelis who lost loved ones on October 7th and Palestinians who lost loved ones during the war in Gaza. Today’s announcement will finally deliver many of those held in captivity back to their loved ones and marks a beginning to the end of the horrible suffering in Gaza. While I had hoped this agreement would be secured many months ago, I appreciate the Biden Administration’s continued efforts to achieve it. 

“In this moment, we must also work to create some light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel. That begins with the urgent need to surge humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance to the people of Gaza. It also means ensuring security, self-determination, and dignity for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. That includes ensuring that a reformed Palestinian Authority, which has long supported peaceful co-existence with the State of Israel, serves as the nucleus of governance in Gaza and moving to secure a two-state solution coupled with the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. 

“What we do next will determine the future of the region for generations to come. The United States must take real and deliberative action, informed by our past mistakes, to build the possibility of a brighter future.”

In their letter, the lawmakers highlight that while the Israel Defense Forces is investigating the shooting, which also injured a 17-year old boy, their preliminary report differs significantly from several eyewitness statements about the incident. 

“We are not aware of any evidence that Aysenur, the teenage boy, or anyone else in her proximity posed any threat to the soldier who shot her, or to anyone else,”  wrote the lawmakers  . “We understand the Israel Defense Forces is investigating this shooting, but a preliminary report released on September 10, 2024, which was reportedly based entirely on information provided by Israel Defense Forces soldiers, asserted that Aysenur was hit ‘indirectly and unintentionally by Israel Defense Forces fire  ,  which was not aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot.’” 

“Detailed statements of international, Israeli, and Palestinian eyewitnesses, as well as a  Washington Post  inquiry that included interviewing 13 eyewitnesses and reviewing more than 50 videos and photographs, describe a significantly different sequence of events, which occurred far from the illegal Evyatar outpost,”  continued the lawmakers  . 

In their letter, the lawmakers requested answers from the Department of State on the following: 

  1. What evidence, if any, is the Administration currently aware of that Aysenur posed a threat to the soldier, or to anyone else, when the soldier fired the shots?

Dear Secretary Blinken, 

On September 6, 2024, 26-year-old U.S.-Turkish citizen Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was fatally shot by an Israeli soldier in the West Bank village of Beita. The soldier was reportedly standing behind a concrete wall on a rooftop of a concrete house at an elevated location approximately 215 – 230 meters from where Aysenur was standing next to a tree, and he fired two shots in close succession using a rifle. A local 17-year-old boy, reportedly standing approximately 15 – 20 meters from her on the other side of the tree, suffered a minor injury from a fragment of the first bullet that had reportedly ricocheted off a metal object. The second bullet hit Aysenur on the left side of her head. We are not aware of any evidence that Aysenur, the teenage boy, or anyone else in her proximity posed any threat to the soldier who shot her, or to anyone else. 

We understand the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is investigating this shooting, but a preliminary report released on September 10, 2024, which was reportedly based entirely on information provided by IDF soldiers, asserted that Aysenur was hit “indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire, which was not aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot.” Detailed statements of international, Israeli, and Palestinian eyewitnesses, as well as a Washington Post inquiry that included interviewing 13 eyewitnesses and reviewing more than 50 videos and photographs, describe a significantly different sequence of events, which occurred far from the illegal Evyatar outpost. This case is disturbingly like the fatal shooting of Shireen Abu Akleh by an Israeli soldier located nearly 200 meters away. Shireen and Aysenur each died from a single gunshot wound to the head. 

We appreciated your statement that Aysenur’s death was “unprovoked and unjustified,” and request your answers to the following questions no later than Tuesday, January 14, 2025: 

1\. What evidence, if any, is the Administration currently aware of that Aysenur posed a threat to the soldier, or to anyone else, when the soldier fired the shots? 

2\. What evidence, if any, is the Administration currently aware of that the soldier who shot her was not aiming at her? 

3\. What evidence, if any, is the Administration currently aware of that the teenage boy who was injured posed a threat to the soldier, or to anyone else, when the soldier fired the shots? 

4\. What IDF unit was the soldier assigned to? 

5\. Who was the “key instigator” and where was he (or she) located when the soldier fired the shots? 

6\. What evidence, if any, is the Administration currently aware of that the “key instigator” posed a threat to the soldier, or to anyone else, when the soldier fired the shots? 

7\. Have you requested the Department of Justice to investigate Aysenur’s case? If not, why not? If so, is an investigation underway? 

Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to your response. 

Sincerely,

10:41:18 root         DEBUG    Titles: Fetterman Celebrates $132 Million CHIPS Act Boost for Pennsylvania's Semiconductor Manufacturing in Bethlehem and Easton
10:41:18 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:41:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: Braddock, PA  —  Today, U.S. Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) celebrated the Department of Commerce’s announcement of two CHIPS Act funding awards for semiconductor production in the commonwealth. The investments include up to $79 million to expand Coherent’s Easton facility and $53 million for Infinera’s new Bethlehem operations. 

“The CHIPS Act continues to deliver for our workers and our economy. This funding will help create more good-paying jobs, strengthen our supply chains, and reinforce Pennsylvania’s position as a hub for innovation and opportunity. Investing in American industry is betting on America’s future and I’m all in,”  said Senator Fetterman. 

Coherent’s award of up to $79 million will help expand capacity to produce 150mm and 200mm silicon carbide (SiC) substrates—key components for electric vehicles and military applications. The Easton expansion is expected to increase production by over 750,000 substrates annually and more than double the output of epitaxial wafers, creating 320 manufacturing jobs and 40 construction jobs. 

Infinera will receive up to $93 million in CHIPS funding, with $53 million dedicated to building an advanced test and packaging facility in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This facility, alongside Infinera’s expanded operations in San Jose, California, will exponentially increase the company’s domestic manufacturing capacity. This investment will create approximately 500 manufacturing jobs and 1,200 construction jobs in Pennsylvania, supporting the production of more energy-efficient components for broadband and optical network infrastructure. 

The CHIPS and Science Act is boosting U.S. semiconductor production, cutting reliance on foreign supply chains, and driving innovation. Over $33 billion in CHIPS funding has been awarded to date, creating 125,000 jobs across 22 states. Pennsylvania’s strategic location and skilled workforce make the commonwealth central to this national effort.

##  Cantwell Statement on Supreme Court TikTok Decision 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released this statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the law requiring the sale of TikTok: 

“The Supreme Court’s 9-0 decision confirmed that there’s a real ‘there’ there when it comes to foreign agents’ influence on TikTok and the threat to national security. I hope the Trump administration will find a solution to shut the Chinese government backdoor, improve the platform, and help content creators earn more revenue for their work,”  Sen. Cantwell said.  “The U.S. government has been trying to get ByteDance to divest since the 2020 Trump Administration Executive Order. I hope President Trump does not now become the one to blink and lose this crucial contest with China.”

##  Cantwell Grills Interior Nominee on Protecting Public Lands: “These Are An Economic Juggernaut” 

##  Cantwell: “You're for this very aggressive oil and lease strategy … How many areas that we've already leased for oil and gas that aren't being used? Why don't we start there?” 

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, questioned Doug Burgum – President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as Secretary of the Interior – on whether he would protect the United States’ public lands, as well as the booming economy they support. 

“Not only will you become steward of over 20% of the land in the United States, but [these are] some of the most beautiful, iconic places in America. And these are an economic juggernaut. They are in my state, if you think about Mount Rainier, or Olympic National Park, or the Hanford Reach, or many other places. The outdoor rec economy generates $1.2 trillion in economic output every year -- $1.2  trillion  . And accounts for 5 million jobs,”  Sen. Cantwell said. 

She asked:  “Will you support more input in outdoor recreation economies and gateway communities? And will you fully utilize the LWCF and support the conservation legacies bills that we've passed?” 

“I agree completely on the importance of this, and it's not only good for the economy, it's also good for the health of Americans. I think one thing that we understand is that we just need more people to get off their devices, get outdoors, get engaged, understand the importance of our land, our wildlife, our soil health,”  Burgum responded. 

Sen. Cantwell pressed:  “Great. So you support the LWCF that we've passed and continuing to support those funds?” 

“Some of those acronyms I'm less familiar with, so I'd look forward to learning more about them,”  Burgum responded, leading Sen. Cantwell to say she would ask Burgum additional questions for the record on this topic. 

Sen. Cantwell also questioned Burgum on his approach to leveraging existing leases to explore for oil and gas on federal lands, versus seeking new ones. 

“You're for this very aggressive oil and lease strategy … How many areas that we've already leased for oil and gas that aren't being used? Why don't we start there?”  she asked. 

Burgum responded: “  Well, I don’t think I would use the term that I was ‘for aggressive.’ I've never stated that. I'm for following the law […] we always want to prioritize those areas that have the most resource opportunity for America with the least impact on lands that are important. And I think that's a pretty simple formula to be able to figure that out.” 

“One of the things that would be helpful to hear from you is that you believe in prioritizing on federal land the leases that are already there, as opposed to now going and saying, ‘Okay, let's, let's get a big map and open up all federal land to new leasing,’”  Sen. Cantwell said. 

Under the first Trump administration, Sen. Cantwell  authored legislation to fully, permanently fund the LWCF  and invest billions of dollars to address the maintenance backlog on public lands throughout Washington state and around the country.  The Great American Outdoors Act, which Sen. Cantwell helped author and cosponsored in the Senate, permanently funded the LWCF at its full authorization level of $900 million per year – roughly two or three times the amount the fund had historically received. Because the funding comes from offshore oil and gas royalties, it does not burden taxpayers or add to the national deficit. Since its creation by Washington Senator Scoop Jackson in 1965, the LWCF has supported more than 42,000 projects in communities throughout the country, including investing more than $725 million in more than 700 projects throughout Washington state.

##  Analog Devices’ Camas, Beaverton Semiconductor Plants to Expand Thanks to $80M Investment From Cantwell’s CHIPS & Science Act 

##  Dept. of Commerce signs agreement to fund expansion of company’s plants in Silicon Forest and Massachusetts, plus job training 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and U.S. Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D, WA-03) announced that Analog Devices is poised to receive an investment of up to $105 million made possible by  Sen. Cantwell's CHIPS & Science Act  , including $80 million for the company’s Pacific Northwest manufacturing plants in Camas, Wash., and Beaverton, Ore. In April, the Members sent a joint  letter in support  of Analog Devices’ application for federal funding for their Pacific Northwest Hub Expansion and Modernization Project. 

The Department of Commerce has signed a non-binding agreement with Analog Devices to provide up to $105 million in proposed direct funding to support projects in the Pacific Northwest and Massachusetts. The Pacific Northwest investment of $80 million will support the expansion of ADI's facilities in Beaverton and Camas. The expansion will allow Analog Devices to make 70% more analog semiconductors at its Pacific Northwest facilities. These are specialized chips needed for everyday products like cars, medical devices, and communications equipment, as well as aerospace and defense systems. By making more of these essential chips in America, the project will help ensure U.S. manufacturers have a dependable supply. The company is also committed to making its operations more environmentally friendly by cutting its use of chemical cleaning materials in half. 

“This investment will strengthen America's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities right here in Southwest Washington,"  said Sen. Cantwell.  "With this funding, Analog Devices' Camas plant will boost production of essential chips used in everything from cars and medical devices to industrial equipment and defense systems. The company will also expand partnerships with local colleges and increase financial support for employees seeking to advance their careers. This investment not only protects against future chip shortages like the one that drove up prices during the pandemic -- it creates life-changing career opportunities for the people of Southwest Washington."   
  
“This award is a big deal for Southwest Washington—with tens of millions in federal funding from the CHIPS Act on the way, Camas is poised to become even more of a hub for domestic chip manufacturing that will support local industries, make our supply chains more resilient, and create hundreds of good-paying new jobs in manufacturing and construction,”  said Sen. Murray.  “I’m also excited about the on-campus training center Analog Devices plans to establish to attract and prepare local workers for a jobs across the semiconductor industry. I was proud to help pass the CHIPS Act, and as the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, securing the federal funding we need to actually implement the legislation and invest in critical manufacturing projects across the country will remain a top priority for me.”   
  
"Innovation in semiconductor manufacturing in the United States is vital to our national security and how we can maintain our competitive edge across the globe,"  said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez.  "I'm glad we could help bring our dollars back home to strengthen Southwest Washington's production of semiconductors and support local manufacturing jobs." 

The Department of Commerce funding will enable Analog Devices to increase its capacity to manufacture front-end mature node semiconductors -- reliable, precision-engineered chips that U.S. companies need for automotive, communications, healthcare, aerospace, defense, and consumer electronics applications. The expansion is expected to create up to 500 manufacturing and engineering jobs across all three ADI sites. 

The non-binding nature of today’s announcement is standard for grants allocated under the CHIPS & Science Act and allows for the prospective recipient to plan project details, source additional capital, and negotiate project milestones with the CHIPS Program before the award is finalized. 

Analog Devices also plans to use the investment to boost workforce development in the Silicon Forest through expanded partnerships with local education partners including Clark College, Washington State University, and Perry Technical Institute in Yakima. The company's  Semiconductor Advanced Manufacturing Upskilling (SAMU) technician training facility  would offer programs to support manufacturers and collaborators in the region. The award would also allow Analog Devices to expand financial support for manufacturing employees working towards associate degrees and technical certifications. 

Sen. Cantwell  was the main architect and key negotiator  of the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, which  authorized  $76 billion in investments for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Since the law's passage, six high-tech manufacturers in the Silicon Forest of Southwest Washington and Portland have announced expansions,  according to the Semiconductor Industry Association  . The greater Portland region supports over 30,000 jobs in computers and electronics, with over 2,800 jobs in semiconductor and related device manufacturing in Clark County alone. 

In August 2022,  Sens. Cantwell and Murray toured technology company nLight  in Camas, to see chip manufacturing workforce opportunities firsthand. 

As Assistant Majority leader in the 117th Congress, Sen. Murray played a key role in securing passage of the CHIPS & Science Act and has  held  events  across  Washington state highlighting the many ways Washington state is benefitting from the new law. In the Fiscal Year 2024 funding bill Sen. Murray negotiated and passed into law, she secured $10.6 billion overall for science and technology programs to implement the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act to help drive U.S. economic competitiveness. The Fiscal Year 2025 funding bill that Sen. Murray  passed out of committee  with overwhelming bipartisan support, 26-3, would deliver $11.2 billion—$635 million more than Fiscal Year 2024—to fund the CHIPS & Science Act.

##  Cantwell Warns Treasury Nom That Trump’s Tariffs Plan Puts Washington Growers and Manufacturers at Risk 

##  Cantwell: “I want to focus on innovation, not tariffs.” 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, warned Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Treasury, of Trump’s proposed tariffs that would harm growers, manufacturers, businesses, and consumers in Washington state. 

“I want to focus on innovation, not the tariffs. I'm worried that the tariffs are going to increase supply chain [prices]. They're going to increase prices on our farmers. They're going to increase prices on Americans,”  said Sen. Cantwell.  “Don't you think we are in an environment where exporting products, and growing markets outside the United States, is a big economic opportunity, and what are you going to do to build coalitions to help us be able to achieve opening up those markets, as opposed to just the retaliatory tariff environment, which may raise costs on Americans and not resolve these issues?” 

Bessent responded:  “So, I agree with you that opening markets is good, but the free trade must be also balanced against fair trade. And clearly, what has happened, is the trade has not been fair, that has fallen on the American workers, and we cannot allow, as I think I mentioned to you, China is the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in the history of the world.” 

Sen. Cantwell continued:  “But I'm saying I believe in coalitions…  I hope that you will look at what we're going to do to build allies. I mean, these numbers that basically are talking about just the tariff and what it would do to the price of gasoline, given Canada, is concerning.” 

“And so, I want to know that that the Trump administration is going to focus as much on innovating our way to success as we are on the tariffs. Because I do think we're going to see retaliatory tariffs. We saw them in our state. It hurt us in our agriculture,”  said Sen. Cantwell. 

Sen. Cantwell was the leading voice in negotiations to end India’s 20% retaliatory tariff on American apples, which devastated Washington state’s apple exports. In September 2023, India  ended its retaliatory tariffs  on apples and pulse crops following  several years  of Sen. Cantwell’s advocacy. 

“We’re losing farmers in the middle of the trade wars, and that's a concern I have,”  Sen. Cantwell added. 

Sen. Cantwell has been a champion for Washington state growers and exports. Sen. Cantwell has been a consistent champion of Washington state’s agriculture industry, which is vital to the state’s economy. Agriculture and food manufacturing generate more than $21 billion per year and employ more than 171,000 people. Small and family farms  are key contributors  , making up 89% and 94%, respectively, of Washington’s farms. 

In May 2023, Sen. Cantwell  sent a letter  urging the Biden Administration to help U.S. potato growers finally get approval to sell fresh potatoes in Japan. In June 2023, Sen. Cantwell hosted U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), then-chair of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, in Washington state  for a forum  with  30 local agricultural leaders  in Wenatchee to discuss the Farm Bill. 

In 2022, Sen. Cantwell spearheaded  passage  of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, a law to crack down on skyrocketing international ocean shipping costs and ease supply chain backlogs that raise prices for consumers and make it harder for U.S. farmers and exporters to get their goods to the global market. 

In August 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sen. Cantwell sent a letter to then-Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue  requesting aid funds be distributed to wheat growers  . In December 2018, Sen. Cantwell celebrated the passage of the Farm Bill, which included  $500 million of assistance for farmers  , including those who grow wheat. 

In 2019, Sen. Cantwell helped  secure a provision  in the $16 billion  USDA relief package  , ensuring sweet cherry growers could access emergency funding to offset the impacts of tariffs and other market disruptions.

##  Cantwell Joins WA Delegation in Calling on Biden for Disaster Declaration After November’s Bomb Cyclone 

##  Initial assessment reveals over $34 million dollars in damage across six counties 

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined the entire Washington Congressional delegation in sending a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to grant former Governor Jay Inslee’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration as a result of the devastating windstorms, heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides caused by a bomb cyclone that struck Washington state in November 2024. 

“The November storm delivered catastrophic impacts across the Evergreen state, impacting millions of residents and wreaking havoc on communities. The storm was one of the most severe the state has seen, toppling trees into homes, damaging power infrastructure across multiple counties, paralyzing major transportation corridors, and tragically claiming two lives,”  the members wrote in their letter to President Biden.  “An initial assessment reveals extensive damage to critical infrastructure, parks, cultural sites, schools, public buildings, and more, resulting in over $34 million dollars in damages across six counties.” 

“We commend the extraordinary efforts of our first responders and emergency personnel whose tireless work under dangerous conditions has been vital in protecting lives and restoring essential services. However, the scale and severity of this disaster has overwhelmed the state’s capacity to recover fully. Federal assistance is critical to supplement the state’s efforts,”  the Members continued. 

In addition, in a meeting yesterday with former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration (SBA), Sen. Cantwell emphasized the critical importance of aid to small businesses following disasters. Earlier this month, the SBA opened two Disaster Loan Outreach Centers in Washington to specifically help businesses and residents who incurred losses during the bomb cyclone. Sen. Cantwell has highlighted access to these centers for Washingtonians who have been affected and more information is available at:  https://www.sba.gov/article/2025/01/03/sba-open-additional-disaster-loan-outreach-centers-washington  . 

The letter was led by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA). The bipartisan group of members urged President Biden to approve the request for assistance as quickly as possible. 

The full text of the letter is available  HERE  and below: 

Dear Mr. President: 

As members of the Washington state delegation, we write in support of Washington state’s January 14, 2025, request for a Major Disaster Declaration due to the devastating windstorms, heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides caused by a bomb cyclone that struck the state from November 17 to November 25, 2024. We implore you to approve the request for assistance as quickly as possible. 

The November storm delivered catastrophic impacts across the Evergreen state, impacting millions of residents and wreaking havoc on communities. The storm was one of the most severe the state has seen, toppling trees into homes, damaging power infrastructure across multiple counties, paralyzing major transportation corridors, and tragically claiming two lives. 

An initial assessment reveals extensive damage to critical infrastructure, parks, cultural sites, schools, public buildings, and more, resulting in over $34 million dollars in damages across six counties. In East King County, where the brunt of damage occurred, more than 400 miles of power transmission lines were affected by the storm, impacting tens of thousands of residents. Prolonged outages left individuals and families unable to heat their homes or preserve food or medical supplies. In Grays Harbor County, significant damage to a water level monitoring device at the Wynoochee Dam rendered it inoperable, posing a serious risk to the dam’s structural integrity and endangering thousands of people who live in downstream communities. Pacific, Snohomish, and Wahkiakum Counties experienced widespread destruction including sinkholes, crippled utility infrastructure, and damaged public and private structures. In eastern Washington, Walla Walla County suffered damage to local utilities and infrastructure, including a local cemetery. Debris removal and cleanup efforts are still underway. 

We commend the extraordinary efforts of our first responders and emergency personnel whose tireless work under dangerous conditions has been vital in protecting lives and restoring essential services. However, the scale and severity of this disaster has overwhelmed the state’s capacity to recover fully. Federal assistance is critical to supplement the state’s efforts. 

We reiterate our full support for Washington state’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration, including assistance from the Public Assistance Program and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. 

Sincerely,

##  Cantwell Secures Commitment From Trump DOT Nominee To Continue Funding Major Infrastructure Projects Like I-5 Bridge Replacement 

##  Cantwell has helped secure over $2.1B in federal funds toward replacing the century-old span connecting Vancouver and Portland, but money has yet to be formally turned over to IBR project 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, secured a commitment from Sean Duffy –President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Transportation – to honor the federal funding that’s been allocated by the Biden administration to projects already underway, including replacing the I-5 bridge between Vancouver and Portland. 

During Duffy's confirmation hearing before the committee, Sen. Cantwell pressed the nominee on continuing support for projects already receiving federal funds. 

“I mentioned the I-5 bridge when we spoke -- the infrastructure investment that's already been planned, that the money has been [allocated] and it's on its way to doing the work. Will you commit to helping complete these projects and continue the funding?”  Sen. Cantwell asked. 

“That are underway? Yes,”  Duffy responded.  “One of the complaints I've heard from the committee is oftentimes the money is not moving fast enough. There's been questions about why it's taking so long. So yes, I'd love to work with you and make sure the money gets out the door to the projects that are underway.” 

Sen. Cantwell pressed him again in a second round of questioning about honoring grants allocated under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL):  “It really becomes an agreement between DOT and the applicant -- both of their commitments to move forward. So, are you going to honor those commitments?” 

Duffy responded:  “I would anticipate honoring those commitments, especially if the law has been followed and the agreements are being met. I think I might get some backlash from this Committee if you're halfway through a project and there's an effort to pull funding. So no, projects are going well, fundings flowing, and the deal is being met. I don't see an issue with that.” 

Video of today’s hearing is available  HERE  ;  a transcript of Sen. Cantwell’s opening statement and Q&A portion is  HERE  . 

Sen. Cantwell has been a leading national voice for replacing the I-5 bridge. She created the National Infrastructure Project Assistance program, or Mega program, with the I-5 bridge in mind. In December 2023, the project was awarded $600 million, the  largest-ever grant  through the program. In July 2024, the project  received  $1.5 billion in federal funds from the Bridge Investment Program (BIP), which was funded through the BIL. Federal grants announced so far, accounting for over $2.1 billion, will fund approximately a third of the estimated $5-7.5 billion total bridge replacement project cost. Of the estimated remaining cost, approximately $1 billion remains eligible for funding through the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Grants Program; the rest will come from state and local sources. 

A one-pager on Sen. Cantwell’s history of leadership establishing the Mega program in the BIL, as well as championing the I-5 bridge replacement project overall, is available  HERE  . 

The I-5 bridge is a crucial linchpin in both the regional and national economy and plays a vital role in transporting freight along the I-5 corridor. IBR  reports  that $132 million worth of freight crossed the I-5 Bridge daily in 2020. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, an  estimated total  of $97 billion in goods traveled by truck either from Washington to Oregon or California, or from Oregon or California to Washington in 2022. The route is also vital to international exporters; in 2021, nearly $2 billion worth of goods from California and $750 million worth of goods from Oregon were trucked to Canada via the I-5 corridor. According to the  Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council  an average of 131,747 vehicles crossed the bridge each weekday in 2021, including many of the 65,000 Clark County residents who work in Oregon. 

Despite the bridge’s importance, it’s  rated  the worst truck bottleneck in Washington and the fifth-worst on the West Coast, with seven to 10 hours of congestion during the morning and evening commute periods. 

In addition, there are significant issues with the aging existing bridge. One span is more than a century old and the other is more than 65 years old. Neither span has had a seismic retrofit, which is a significant concern in a region susceptible to earthquake activity: the entire structure is at risk of collapse in the event of a major earthquake. Moreover, simply maintaining the existing structure is expensive. Annual maintenance costs are about $1.2 million per year and larger maintenance projects needed to simply maintain the bridge are expected to cost $280 million by 2040 – not including the cost of a seismic retrofit, which would be substantial. Today, these maintenance costs are split equally between the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Oregon Department of Transportation. 

In August 2024, Sen. Cantwell  joined  Federal Highway Administrator Shailen Bhatt to celebrate the $1.5 billion BIP grant. Video of that press conference is available  HERE  , audio  HERE  , photos  HERE  , and a transcript of Sen. Cantwell’s remarks  HERE. 

In January 2024, Sen. Cantwell held a roundtable discussion with local leaders, stakeholders, and other federal officials. The group toured the I-5 bridge and discussed future funding opportunities for completion of the replacement project. [  PRESS RELEASE  |  PHOTOS  ] 

In spring of 2022, Sen. Cantwell toured the I-5 bridge along with local and regional leaders; photos of that tour are available for download  HERE  and video is  HERE  .

##  Cantwell Urges Energy Sec. Nominee to “Uphold the Commitment” to Clean Up Hanford 

##  “I am firmly committed to continuing our obligations and our moral obligation to clean up the mess that was left in your state,” nominee Chris Wright says under Cantwell questioning 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), a longtime member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, urged Chris Wright – President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Energy – to uphold the Department of Energy’s commitment to clean up Hanford. 

The exchange came today during Wright’s confirmation hearing before the committee. 

“Will you commit to upholding the Tri-Party agreement between DOE and the State of Washington and others in supporting Hanford cleanup and advocating for a budget that represents that commitment?”  Sen. Cantwell asked. 

“Senator, I can't overstate how critical I think it is to finish the job, finish the cleanup at Hanford,”  Wright responded.  “The majority of our country's plutonium was produced there, not just for World War II, but the post war period and our arsenal today. So, Hanford gave a lot to this country, and we behind, left a mess, and that needs to be cleaned up.” 

Wright added:  “It's being cleaned up, thanks in part to your efforts and many in your state to push for that. But I am firmly committed to continuing our obligations and our moral obligation to clean up the mess that was left in your state.” 

Sen. Cantwell pressed the nominee to provide a definitive answer on his commitment to upholding the agreement that was recently finalized by the Department of Energy, Washington State Department of Ecology, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Sen. Cantwell has long championed Hanford clean-up and played a leading role in overseeing the Department of Energy’s cleanup efforts and fighting numerous Administration proposals to cut Hanford budgets. 

Throughout the first Trump administration, Sen. Cantwell  repeatedly led the charge  in opposing drastic cuts to the Hanford budget, and in 2020  she led a successful effort  to defeat a provision in the annual National Defense Authorization Act that could have diverted billions in funding from ongoing clean-up projects. 

  
In January 2021, at the nomination hearing for former Secretary of Energy Granholm, Sen. Cantwell  secured a pledge to fully fund Hanford cleanup  from the nominee. Secretary Granholm  visited the DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  in Richland and the Hanford site with Sen. Cantwell in August 2022 and they discussed the need for increased and sustained funding.

##  Spokane Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center Tech Hub Launches With $48 Million Federal Grant 

##  Spokane Tech Hub would boost WA State’s aviation manufacturing ecosystem with impacts felt all along the I-90 corridor 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $48 million for the  American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center  (AAMMC) in Spokane. This funding comes from the Tech Hubs Program, which Sen. Cantwell established in her landmark CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This investment follows the Senators’ successful efforts to secure up to $500 million for Tech Hubs in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 

“The country that figures out how to use advanced materials to increase manufacturing capacity and aircraft fuel efficiency is going to have a huge competitive advantage,”  said Sen. Cantwell.  “America is handing the baton to Spokane – establishing it as an innovation testbed for high-rate aerospace materials manufacturing. We’re betting on Spokane’s leadership and manufacturing base to solve the aviation challenges America faces. This important R&D mission will help ensure our nation’s future aerospace leadership.” 

“This is great news for Spokane and all of Eastern Washington,”  said Sen. Murray.  “These new resources build on the hundreds of millions I fought hard to secure for Tech Hubs under tough funding constraints and this award is a testament to the cutting-edge research and incredible collaboration happening across Washington state. These investments are critical as we work to ensure Washington state continues to lead the way in aerospace innovation and jobs. As the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, fighting for the resources we need to help spur the already incredible work happening in our state will always be a top priority for me.” 

“I was pleased to find common ground with Senator Cantwell on funding two Eastern Washington priorities before the end of last year - making sure Chinese Communist Party equipment is removed from rural cell networks and continuing important research at regional tech hubs. I am thrilled the AAMMC in Spokane will benefit from this bipartisan work with today’s announcement, enabling it to continue its vital aerospace research and testing so that America wins the future in the sky and space.”  – Former Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers 

“We will benefit tremendously from the business expansion and good jobs that will result from this unprecedented federal investment. I’m grateful to Senators Murray and Cantwell and the Biden Administration for creating and funding this generational opportunity. The City of Spokane stands ready to work with our Tech Hub partners to put these dollars to work.”  – Spokane Mayor Lisa Brown 

"Through the University of Washington's Advanced Composites Center's collaboration with the American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center, we are pioneering the next generation of lightweight, sustainable aircraft materials that will revolutionize both commercial and defense aviation. Our research teams are tackling the complex manufacturing challenges that will define the future of flight. Together with our AAMMC partners, we are ensuring that Washington state remains a global leader in aerospace discovery and innovation."  – University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce 

“I am so pleased that the EDA has made this significant grant to the AAMMC. We have been confident from the beginning that the Spokane-North Idaho Tech Hub holds tremendous potential for the development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, and production that will help meet critical demand for aerospace components. I am very grateful for the support and advocacy of Senator Cantwell, who has been instrumental in creating this opportunity in the first place, and Senator Murray, who has fought to provide strong funding for the Tech Hub program as part of the annual appropriations process. We are committed to pursuing additional funding to support educational programs and workforce development that will be essential to the success of the Tech Hub.”  – Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh 

“This investment paves the way for Washington’s aerospace future and the thousands of workers who will benefit from it. Spokane’s Tech Hub positions our state at the forefront of sustainable aviation innovation, ensuring we remain a global leader in aerospace manufacturing. By advancing cutting-edge thermoplastics and advanced manufacturing, this initiative not only bolsters our economy but also creates remarkable opportunities for the next generation of machinists and aerospace workers. IAM District 751 is proud to partner with U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) to build the infrastructure needed to train a skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow.”  – IAM District 751 President Jon Holden. 

The funding will establish the first-of-its-kind testbed facility in the United States focused on developing advanced thermoplastic materials - new types of lightweight, heat-moldable, and recyclable materials that can replace metal in aircraft parts. The AAMMC will serve as the nation's hub for creating and testing these innovative materials that are essential for more rapidly building fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft. The hub will focus on development of thermoplastic composite materials for large aerostructures in defense and commercial markets, which can make aircraft and spacecraft lighter and more fuel-efficient, while being rapidly produced and recyclable. As the global aviation industry projects demand for over 40,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years, this center will accelerate U.S. innovation in sustainable aviation by enabling manufacturers to test and validate new technologies before moving to full-scale production. 

Nearly 50 Spokane-area organizations collaborated on the Tech Hub, including Gonzaga University, the International Association of Machinists District 751, and Advanced Thermoplastics Composites (ATC). The hub will provide hands-on workforce training through partnerships with the Machinists Institute, North Idaho College, and Community Colleges of Spokane, creating career pathways in advanced manufacturing.  A full list of Spokane Tech Hub partners is available  HERE  . 

In October 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce  announced  the greater Spokane region as one of the 31 federally designated U.S. Tech Hubs out of more than 200 applicants. Shortly after the Spokane American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center was designated, both Senators Cantwell and Murray  hailed the decision  . Sen. Cantwell celebrated the announcement  and spoke on the Senate floor  on the importance of creating these regional hubs to develop ‘lab to market’ testbeds for advanced materials manufacturing in communities already excelling in workforce development, research, and innovation. The designation means that the federal government is betting on Washington state – on both sides of the Cascade Mountains – as the future of our nation’s aviation manufacturing and aerospace industry. 

The Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (  Tech Hubs  ) program was established by the CHIPS & Science Law, with a mission to strengthen U.S. economic and national security with investments in regions across the country. By securing up to $500 million through the most recent funding, the Senators ensured that additional hubs, like Spokane, were able to receive Phase II implementation awards. 

The official designation further confirmed that the Inland Northwest is a leading national ecosystem for aerospace suppliers, private investment, new products, and companies in the U.S. aerospace supply chain.  A full list of all Spokane Tech Hub partners is available  HERE. 

The  map below  shows the number of aerospace suppliers along the I-90 corridor, with many key composite suppliers already located in the greater Spokane area. 

Sen. Cantwell  was the main architect and key negotiator  of the CHIPS & Science Act. In her position as Commerce chair, she was  instrumental  in securing the science R&D funding authorizations in the 11th hour of negotiations. In April 2023, Sen. Cantwell invited NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan to Spokane, where he  saw firsthand  how Spokane organizations have collaborated to drive the region’s current and future potential as a leader in technology innovation. In July 2023, Sen. Cantwell  hosted  the Washington State Space Summit, bringing together 20 space companies, industry groups, and educators from across the State of Washington for a trade show and panel discussion. Sen. Cantwell hosted an  aerospace manufacturing showcase  at Blue Origin in April 2024 to bring workforce development leaders, innovators, and industry representatives together to discuss what the designation means for Washington state. 

Video of that discussion is available  HERE  and  HERE  ; photos of the event are  HERE  . 

As Assistant Majority leader in the 117th Congress, Senator Murray played a key role in securing passage of the CHIPS & Science Act and has  held  events  across  Washington state highlighting the many ways Washington state is benefitting from the new law. As the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Murray has secured $541 million for the Tech Hubs program since Fiscal Year 2023 and is working to secure an additional $100 million in the Fiscal Year 2025 bills she is currently negotiating. In the Fiscal Year 2024 funding bill Murray negotiated and passed into law, she secured $10.6 billion overall for science and technology programs to implement the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act to help drive U.S. economic competitiveness. The Fiscal Year 2025 funding bill that Murray  passed out of committee  with overwhelming bipartisan support, 26-3, would deliver $11.2 billion—$635 million more than Fiscal Year 2024—to fund the CHIPS & Science Act.

10:51:39 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote today to DraftKings and Delta Air Lines urging the companies to pause implementation of a recently announced partnership to offer in-flight gaming to passengers. In a letter to DraftKings CEO Jason Robins and Delta CEO Ed Bastian, Blumenthal pointed to the Gambling Devices Act of 1961, which outlawed gambling on commercial aircraft, and sought answers from the companies about safeguards they are considering to protect the flying public, including minors, from enticements that can hook them on an addictive product. 

“This new partnership advances the proliferation of sports betting, further fueling a crisis of problem gambling. Betting companies have leveraged data collected on consumers to entice them through bonuses and promotions to hook them on this addictive product – resulting in a public health crisis that is producing huge costs in addiction, financial ruin, family disruption and much more,”  Blumenthal wrote. 

Blumenthal continued,  “Problem gambling is particularly rampant among young people. Given that a significant number of minors fly each year, I am especially concerned that this partnership could be advertised or available to children, enticing them to engage in betting. Delta Air Line’s family seating policy does not guarantee adjacent seats for children under thirteen and their accompanying adult, which only exacerbates these concerns.” 

The full text of Blumenthal’s letter is  available here  and below. 

Dear Mr. Robins and Mr. Bastian, 

I write with significant concerns regarding the recently announced partnership between Delta Air Lines and DraftKings to offer in-flight gaming to passengers.  [1]  As you know, under the Gambling Devices Act of 1962, gambling is illegal on commercial aircraft.  [2] 

This new partnership advances the proliferation of sports betting, further fueling a crisis of problem gambling. Betting companies have leveraged data collected on consumers to entice them through bonuses and promotions to hook them on this addictive product – resulting in a public health crisis that is producing huge costs in addiction, financial ruin, family disruption and much more. This partnership seems to be aimed at enticing the flying public – many of them possibly problem gamblers or recovering problem gamblers – to engage in a high-risk activity from their seatbacks, while in the air and unable to walk away. 

Problem gambling is particularly rampant among young people. Given that a significant number of minors fly each year, I am especially concerned that this partnership could be advertised or available to children, enticing them to engage in betting. Delta Air Line’s family seating policy does not guarantee adjacent seats for children under thirteen and their accompanying adult, which only exacerbates these concerns. 

I call on you to pause the implementation of this partnership immediately and please provide a written response to this letter with details on this agreement and any protections you may have included to protect the flying public, including minors, by no later than January 28, 2025. 

Sincerely,

10:51:40 root         DEBUG    Titles: ICYMI Video: Blumenthal Presses Vought on Dangerous Proposals to Means-Test Veterans' Disability Benefits
10:51:40 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:51:40 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing this week on the nomination of Russell Vought to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) raised serious concerns about Vought’s previous proposals to begin means-testing veterans’ disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Similar harmful proposals that would negatively impact veterans have also been included as part of  Project 2025  – of which Vought was a leading contributor and  organizer  . 

“I’m the Ranking Member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I’m concerned by your proposal that there should be a means-test for who deserves [Department of] Veterans Affairs disability compensation,”  said Blumenthal.  “For me, nothing is more important than caring for our veterans. I think that is true for many of us on both sides of the aisle. Do you believe that veterans should receive disability benefits only if they qualify under some kinds of means-test?” 

Vought authored a  2023 Budget Proposal  which proposed reducing VA spending by means-testing veterans’ disability compensation and narrowing certain veterans’ eligibility for disability compensation. This would withhold earned benefits from veterans whose household income is above an arbitrary threshold, and eliminate disability compensation for veterans rated below a certain disability percentage—negatively impacting veterans who rely on VA disability compensation benefits. 

While Vought sidestepped answering the Senator’s question, Blumenthal emphasized that Vought in the past has taken the position there should be a means-test in his budget proposal as President of the Center for Renewing America:  “You’re not going to answer that question. But you have in the past taken the position that there should be a means test.” 

The Senator also pressed Vought on his proposal to cut disability compensation for veterans below a certain disability rating:  “Do you believe that disability compensation benefits for veterans should be eliminated if any veteran has a disability rating below 30%?...That is the proposal from the Center for Renewing America – the organization that you founded. Do you continue to believe it?” 

As Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Blumenthal is a staunch defender of protecting and expanding benefits and health care veterans earned and deserve—including their disability compensation provided under the  PACT Act  . Blumenthal  championed key provisions  of the  PACT Act  to expand benefits, health care, and compensation to toxic-exposed veterans previously unable to access its services and helped get it passed into law in 2022. 

The full text of Blumenthal’s exchange with Vought about veterans’ disability compensation is copied below. Video of Blumenthal’s remarks is available for  download here  . 

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT):  I’m the Ranking Member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I’m concerned by your proposal that there should be a means-test for who deserves [Department of] Veterans Affairs disability compensation. For me, nothing is more important than caring for our veterans. I think that is true for many of us on both sides of the aisle. Do you believe that veterans should receive disability benefits only if they qualify under some kinds of means-test? 

Russell Vought:  Senator, the President has been a firm supporter of veterans spending – of getting everything veterans need. That was always reflected in all the budgets the President sent to the Hill— 

Blumenthal:  I’m going to interrupt you, with apology, because my time is running out. Do you believe there should be a means test for disability benefits going to veterans? 

Vought:  Again, I’m not going to speak to any of the policy— 

Blumenthal:  You’re not going to answer that question. But you have in the past taken the position that there should be a means-test. 

Vought:  The President has always fully supported veteran spending and put forward everything that they need, that the Department of VA does, and I fully expect that to continue. 

Blumenthal:  Do you believe that disability compensation benefits for veterans should be eliminated if any veteran has a disability rating below 30%? 

Vought:  Senator I’m not here on behalf of what I think, but I’m here on behalf of the President— 

Blumenthal:  That is the proposal from the Center for Renewing America – the organization that you founded. Do you continue to believe it? 

Vought:  It is the think tank I am currently the President of. It is not the agenda of the incoming President of the United States. And so, I’m here on behalf of being his nominee and doing his budgets. 

Blumenthal:  Is that what he believes? 

Vought:  Again, you should judge him by the budgets he sends forth to Congress. I am here on behalf of the fiscal responsibility he wants to restore, and I fully intend to do that if confirmed.

“I am hopeful that Sagui Dekel-Chen may soon be among the hostages freed in the cease-fire agreement. I spoke today to his father, Jonathan, a Connecticut native, to express my support, and my prayers for his swift release, along with other hostages who have lived through such horror. 

“Continuing Biden-Trump teamwork putting maximum pressure on all sides is vital to complete the deal. There is no cause for complacency or victory laps at this critical moment, when the fate of the hostages hangs in the balance. 

“Having spoken to so many hostage families over these painful months, I am in awe of their courage and strength—which should inspire and embolden the work to overcome remaining obstacles. There is no resting until all the hostages are released.”

10:51:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – In case you missed it, during this week’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the nomination of Russell Vought to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), pressed Vought on whether President-elect Trump’s administration will release Ukraine aid authorized and approved by Congress. Vought refused to commit to doing so when asked by Blumenthal, calling into question whether the incoming administration will defy current law that requires presidents to spend money as directed by Congress. 

Text of Blumenthal’s exchange with Vought is copied below. Video of Blumenthal’s remarks is available for  download here  . 

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT):  Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your service, Mr. Vought, and your willingness to come back. Thank you also to your family. 

As you know, in the closing days of the last session, the United States Congress, by overwhelming majorities, approved disaster relief funding going to the Department of Agriculture as well as FEMA, for disaster relief all around the country. Will you commit to releasing those funds promptly and fully to the areas that depend on that disaster relief funding? 

Mr. Russell Vought:  We will continue to release the money that has appropriately been funded for these areas, as we always have with regard to the FEMA dollars. 

Blumenthal:  So, the answer is yes? 

Vought:  Yes, we will continue to – 

Blumenthal:  Well, you won’t continue because you are not yet in office. You will release that money fully and promptly to the agencies that can provide that relief. For example, the $31 billion, I believe it is, for the Army Corps and the Agriculture Department, the $2.2 billion for the Small Business Administration, $29 billion for FEMA, these are specific amounts. How about the $3.8 billion left for security assistance to Ukraine, will you release that money? 

Vought:  Again, Senator, I’m not going to get ahead of the policy process of the incoming administration, but when it comes to responding to the disasters, the President has always been someone that cares deeply about these areas – 

Blumenthal:  Well, I am talking about the Ukraine funding, which I believe is essential, the Congress believed it’s vital. It has been authorized and appropriated. Will you release that remaining $3.8 billion? 

Vought:  Again, Senator, I’m not going to get ahead of the President on a foreign policy issue of the magnitude of the situation with regard to Ukraine– 

Blumenthal:  Let me ask you, do you believe the  Impoundment Control Act  is constitutional? 

Vought:  No, I do not believe it’s constitutional. The President ran on that view. That’s his view, and I agree with him. 

Blumenthal:  Have you read  Train v. New York  ? That’s the United States Supreme Court saying it is constitutional. You are saying that you are just going to defy the Courts, the Office of Legal Counsel under both administrations, including then-Attorney Rehnquist, afterward becoming Supreme Court Justice, wrote for the Office of Legal Counsel, you are simply going to take the law into your own hands? 

Vought:  I did not say that nor did I imply that on behalf of the incoming administration. I said earlier to a question from Senator Peters, that the incoming administration was going to have to take the President’s view on this as he stated on the campaign, work it through with the lawyers of the Department of Justice, some of whom are coming before Congress just today, if confirmed, and to put that through a policy process. I can’t prejudge that policy process, but I certainly can announce the parameters of what it would produce. 

Blumenthal:  I am astonished and aghast that someone in this responsible a position would, in effect, say that the President is above the law and that the United States Supreme Court is entitled to their opinion, but mine should supersede it. It is just baffling that we are in this, I think, unprecedented moment in the history of this country. And I think our colleagues should be equally aghast, because this issue goes beyond Republican or Democrat. It is bigger than one administration or another. It is whether the law of the land should prevail or maybe it’s up for grabs depending on what the President thinks. I think it is fundamental, and I hope you will reconsider this view. And I am going to put it in a question for the record, to give you an opportunity to recast your answer—which I think should be disqualifying for both sides of the aisle, frankly, because what goes around comes around. The next administration could be democratic, could be independent. But the Supreme Court in  Train v. New York  said it’s constitutional. That’s been the clear consensus.

10:51:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote today to President-elect Donald Trump’s presumptive nominee to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Kash Patel, demanding an explanation for his previously stated support of harmful conspiracy theories, such as QAnon, and raising concerns about his apparent disregard for the importance of the FBI’s work and staff and his threats to weaponize the FBI against political enemies and journalists. 

“As a counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative body, the Bureau has a direct impact on the lives and safety of all Americans,”  wrote Blumenthal.  “The Bureau also employs approximately 38,000 people, has an annual budget of over $10 billion, and maintains domestic field offices and more than 90 overseas offices and sub-offices. When the Bureau’s agents do not receive adequate support or leadership, the American people suffer—child predators walk free, drug cartels poison the public, and terrorists claim lives.” 

Blumenthal continued,  “As the nation’s top federal law enforcement organization, the FBI must be committed to rigorous investigation and concrete facts. Instead, you have publicly promoted false claims regarding 2020 election fraud, the FBI’s involvement in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and the QAnon conspiracy theory. A person who promotes and amplifies unverified and harmful conspiracy theories is simply not qualified to serve as the Bureau’s Director.” 

“I am deeply concerned by the variety of ways your comments and actions suggest you are unfit to lead the FBI. In his memoir, Former Attorney General Barr—who led the DOJ under President Trump—wrote that you ‘had virtually no experience that would qualify [you] to serve at the highest level of the world’s preeminent law enforcement agency.’ Your actions and rhetoric since you worked with Former Attorney General Barr appear only to confirm his concerns and demonstrate a disregard for both law enforcement and the law, an affinity for debunked and baseless conspiracy theories, and a desire to use the Bureau as a tool of political retribution,”  Blumenthal concluded. 

The full text of Blumenthal’s letter is  available here  and below. 

Dear Mr. Patel,   
  


Congratulations on your nomination to serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI” or “the Bureau”). I look forward to your upcoming testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 

The FBI Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Bureau, which serves as the principal federal law enforcement agency of the United States.  [1]  As a counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative body, the Bureau has a direct impact on the lives and safety of all Americans. The Bureau also employs approximately 38,000 people, has an annual budget of over $10 billion, and maintains 55 domestic field offices and more than 90 overseas offices and sub-offices.  [2]  When the Bureau’s agents do not receive adequate support or leadership, the American people suffer—child predators walk free, drug cartels poison the public, and terrorists claim lives. 

Given your past statements and writings—including your promotion of harmful conspiracy theories, disregard for the importance of the Bureau’s work and staff, and threats to weaponize the FBI against political enemies and journalists—I am deeply concerned about your qualifications to serve in this role. 

Promotion of Conspiracy Theories 

As the nation’s top federal law enforcement organization, the FBI must be committed to rigorous investigation and concrete facts. Instead, you have publicly promoted false claims regarding 2020 election fraud, the FBI’s involvement in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and the QAnon conspiracy theory. A person who promotes and amplifies unverified and harmful conspiracy theories is simply not qualified to serve as the Bureau’s Director. 

False Claims Regarding the 2020 Election 

The Director of the FBI leads the nation’s top federal law enforcement agency. It is, therefore, essential that the Bureau’s leader respects election results, regardless of politics, and aggressively combats efforts by foreign adversaries and domestic actors to illegitimately co-opt those elections. Disturbingly, however, since the results of the 2020 election were finalized, you have consistently and repeatedly supported President-Elect Trump’s incorrect and dangerous claim that the election was stolen from him by President Biden. You have vowed to “come after” the people you allege “helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”  [3]  The title of your children’s book,  The Plot Against the King: 2,000 Mules  , directly references a completely debunked election conspiracy film—and the plot is a thinly veiled recitation of false claims regarding the 2020 election.  [4] 

The integrity of our nation’s elections is of the utmost importance. Stopping the spread of inaccurate and misleading information—often planted and promoted by foreign adversaries—is essential in ensuring our elected government truly is of, by, and for the people. The FBI is the “lead federal agency responsible for investigating foreign influence operations.”  [5]  Replacing its leader with someone who himself spreads misinformation would only increase the vulnerability of our elections and embolden our country's rivals. 

Promotion of the QAnon Conspiracy Theory 

The QAnon conspiracy theory falsely claims that the so-called “deep state” works alongside pedophile political elites to traffic children.  [6]  Adherents of QAnon believe that a government insider known as “Q” is working to take down this alleged network and has provided clues via online message boards.  [7]  QAnon supporters have been aware of you for years—in 2018, you were mentioned by name in one of those supposed clues with the note “name to remember.”  [8] 

The FBI—the very agency you are nominated to lead—included QAnon in its 2022 report on Strategic Intelligence Assessment and Data on Domestic Terrorism, writing: 

We assess that adherence to elements of the continuously evolving QAnon conspiracy theory—some of which are bolstered by the resonance of election fraud narratives—will contribute to the radicalization and mobilization to violence of a small number of [domestic violent extremists], posing a threat to individuals and institutions that supporters of the conspiracy theory have prominently denounced.  [9] 

Yet despite these warnings, rather than creating distance between yourself and the QAnon theory, you have seemingly aligned yourself with it and sought to bolster your relationship to the QAnon-adherent community. In fact, you have made over 50 appearances on podcasts where you have promoted the QAnon movement or shared QAnon-related conspiracy information, including appearing on a podcast known for championing the QAnon theory.  [10]  And, in 2022, you inscribed copies of your books with a QAnon slogan and used the same phrase on a podcast.  [11]  When asked if you subscribed to the theory, you said “I disagree with a lot of what that movement says, but I agree with what a lot of that movement says.”  [12] 

Moreover, you have not hesitated to exploit your ties to the QAnon movement. In 2022, as you served on the board of the parent company for Truth Social, President-Elect Trump’s social media platform, you promoted an account called “@Q” and said about Truth Social’s overtures to QAnon that “[you] try to incorporate it into [y]our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences.”  [13]  About the theory itself, you said “[t]here’s a lot of good to a lot of it.”  [14] 

False Claims Regarding January 6, 2021 

Particularly concerning for someone nominated to lead the FBI, you have also promoted the unsupported claim that government agents instigated the insurrection on January 6, 2021 in an effort to discredit President-Elect Trump and the MAGA movement.  [15]  Specifically, you called for an investigation into why an alleged undercover government agent “was allowed to encourage and incite a riot in and around some events of January 6  th  .”  [16]  There are simply no facts that support this allegation. 

Despite your nomination to one of this nation’s highest law enforcement positions, your rhetoric and actions suggest you believe the people who conducted the Capitol riot, including those who viciously assaulted law enforcement officers from the Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department who were defending the Capitol, should escape accountability. You claim to have provided, via your foundation, financial support for the legal defense of “defamed American citizens” including January 6  th  rioters.  [17]  You have falsely alleged misconduct against the bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate the January 6  th  Attack on the United States Capitol, saying “[m]embers of Congress can’t hide behind the speech and debate clause for committing felonies when it comes to destroying and suppressing evidence to law enforcement agencies” and calling for a “full-fledged investigation.”  [18] 

The Director of the FBI must be committed to truth, not baseless and politically motivated conspiracies. Based on these concerns, I request answers to the following questions: 

  1. If confirmed as Director of the FBI, will you recommend or support prohibiting the FBI from combatting the spread of misinformation by foreign adversaries? 


  2. Are you a believer in the QAnon conspiracy theory? 


  2.     1. Please identify the specific statements by the QAnon movement that you were referring to when you stated: “I disagree with a lot of what that movement says, but I agree with what a lot of that movement says.”  [19] 


  2.     2. Please describe the aspects of the QAnon theory that you had in mind when you stated that “[t]here’s a lot of good to a lot of it.”  [20] 


  3. If confirmed as Director of the FBI, will you commit to combatting all forms of domestic violent extremism, including the threats posed by adherents to QAnon? 


  4. If confirmed as Director of the FBI, will you commit to continuing the ongoing investigations into the perpetrators of the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the United States Capitol? 


  4.     1. Please provide a list of the January 6, 2021 investigations you will support and those you plan to recommend the closing of if confirmed as Director of the FBI. Please include your justification for each. 


  5. Do you believe that the FBI or other government actors instigated the insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021? 


  5.     1. If so, please provide all facts and information that underlie that conclusion. 



Damage to the FBI and its Efficacy 

You have consistently vocalized an antagonism towards the Bureau’s work and workforce. If you act consistent with these views when empowered to lead the Bureau, I fear you will impair its ability to perform investigations and safeguard our country. Even your very nomination, coming in the middle of the current Director’s 10-year term, breaks from post-Watergate practice and has drawn bipartisan criticism.  [21] 

In your book,  Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy  , you aver that members of the “deep state” are “the most dangerous threat to our democracy” and serve as a “cabal of unelected tyrants.”  [22]  The “deep state,” per your book, is made up of a variety of actors: politicians, journalists, Big Tech leaders, and individuals associated with non-governmental organizations.  [23]  In your words, however, the “most dogged” are “officials within the executive branch itself—members of the unelected federal bureaucracy who think they have the right to rule America.”  [24]  It comes as no surprise, therefore, that you believe that “[o]ne of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”  [25] 

Your open hostility to the FBI would have a devastating impact on the Bureau’s workforce, and therefore its ability to “protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.”  [26]  Your book calls for the “comprehensive housecleaning” of the Bureau and the firing of its “top ranks.”  [27]  You have said you intend to essentially shut down the Bureau’s headquarters and “open it up the next day as a museum to the deep state.”  [28]  And you also support stripping security clearances from personnel who staffed investigations involving President-Elect Trump, including “everybody that participated at the FBI in Russia-gate.”  [29] 

As the nation’s primary federal law enforcement agency, the Bureau is responsible for investigations in areas as diverse as white-collar crime, child exploitation, public corruption, counterterrorism, counterespionage, and drug trafficking. It needs a Director capable of spearheading a broad array of investigations while simultaneously managing a workforce of thousands and a budget of billions—not one who believes it is staffed by unelected would-be dictators that need to be expelled.  [30]  Your comments make clear that your FBI would be one in which experience is a drawback, rather than an advantage, and highly competent, qualified agents and other personnel would be removed in favor of loyalists. 

Indeed, your potential leadership has already done tangible—not merely hypothetical—damage to the Bureau. Since the announcement of your nomination, reporting has revealed many longtime FBI agents intend to retire should you be confirmed and others have already done so in preparation for your leadership.  [31]  You would inherit a Bureau bereft of their years of experience and expertise. Perhaps you would consider this potential exodus an efficient start to the “comprehensive housecleaning” for which you have called.  [32]  I, on the other hand, find it deeply concerning for the safety and security of the American people. 

Based on these concerns, I request answers to the following questions: 

  1. In your book,  Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy  , you wrote that “[o]ne of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”  [33]  Please explain what aspects of the FBI you believe qualify as components of the so-called “deep state.” 


  2. Do you believe the FBI serves an important function in this country? 


  2.     1. Please describe that function.   
  

  3. If you are confirmed as Director of the FBI, what will you do to prevent a mass exodus of long-serving, experienced agents who are disturbed by your history of denigrating their work and the Bureau? 


  3.     1. What will you do to support recruitment of new qualified agents? 


  4. Will you commit to conducting recruitment of new agents and other Bureau personnel in a non-partisan manner and without imposing ideological litmus tests? 



Threats to Target Political Enemies, Judges, and Journalists 

You have professed an intent to use your authority as Director to target political enemies, judges, and journalists in pursuit of political and personal vendettas. This leaves me deeply concerned that you may not possess the judgment, integrity, and qualifications to serve in this role. The Director of the FBI must act with the utmost political independence and integrity—a person prepared to use the Bureau to effectuate President-Elect Trump’s threats of political retribution and wage personal vendettas is simply not qualified to serve as the Director of the FBI. 

Political Figures 

The FBI’s long-standing independence from electoral politics is based in law and the norms and practices that have emerged within the Executive Branch over the past half century.  [34]  Since the Watergate scandal in 1972, presidents of both parties, including President-Elect Trump in his first term, have enacted policies to preserve the independence of both the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the FBI from the White House.  [35]  Every administration from President Carter to President Biden—including President-Elect Trump in his first term—has restricted communications between the DOJ, including the FBI, and the White House regarding law enforcement investigations and other matters.  [36]  This has ensured that the FBI has the independence and impartiality to conduct investigations of presidents and top White House officials for alleged unlawful activity where appropriate.  [37]  And, to be clear, this has been true whether the focus of the investigation was a Democrat or Republican. Notably, in July 2015—during a Democratic administration—the FBI began investigating alleged actions of the then-presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic party.  [38] 

You have made a number of comments in multiple fora that suggest you would actively seek to undermine the political independence of the FBI if you served as Director. As previously mentioned, you wrote in your book,  Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy  , that members of the “deep state” are “the most dangerous threat to our democracy” and serve as a “cabal of unelected tyrants.”  [39]  In that book, you also published a list of so-called “Members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” which identified 60 current and former officials by name—both top Democratic politicians and officials, as well as former Trump Administration officials who are no longer supportive of the President-Elect, such as Former Attorney General William Barr and Former National Security Advisor John Bolton.  [40]  Furthermore, you acknowledged that this list was not exhaustive and did not include “other corrupt actors of the first order”—including now-Senator Adam Schiff and other members of Congress.  [41] 

You have also demonstrated a clear intent to pursue prosecutions of political opponents if President-Elect Trump tells you to do so. During a rally featuring President-Elect Trump, you said to the audience that “[w]e are on a mission to annihilate the deep state.”  [42]  In reference to a number of people on your enemies list, including President Biden, Vice President Harris, and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray, you said “these people need to go to prison.”  [43]  And in a 2023 podcast interview with Steven Bannon, you confirmed your confidence in being able to bring about prosecutions against members of the “deep state” during a second Trump administration, saying that: 

The one thing we learned in the Trump Administration the first go-around is we’ve got to put in all-American patriots top to bottom, and we got them for law enforcement, we got them for intel[ligence] collection, we got them for offensive operations, we got them for DOD, CIA, everywhere.  [44] 

Journalists, Lawyers, and Judges 

Moreover, your pledges of retribution have not been limited to political figures. You have also vowed to target journalists, lawyers, and judges who have been opposed to President-Elect Trump—those you have falsely labeled as so-called “conspirators” who “helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”  [45]  Indeed, your conception of members of the “deep state” and “conspirators” appears to include any person who you have deemed influential and who has opposed your favored political official. 

In the same deeply concerning 2023 podcast interview with Steve Bannon, you pledged that, should President-Elect Trump be reelected, you would “go out and find the conspirators—not just in government, but in the media,” saying that “we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens” and “correct these justices and lawyers who’ve been prosecuting these cases based on politics.”  [46] 

The Director of the FBI has a duty to investigate criminal wrongdoing and protect this country—not to pursue political or personal vendettas. Your past comments and writings reveal a willingness and enthusiasm to use the Bureau as a tool in President-Elect Trump’s retribution campaign that is entirely inconsistent with its mission as a nonpartisan law enforcement and national security agency. Without a Director willing to enforce independence from the President and adhere to integrity over politics, the Bureau will fail in its mission to “protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.”  [47] 

Given these concerns, I request answers to the following questions: 

  1. Do you agree that the FBI must remain independent of the presidency? If confirmed as FBI Director, do you commit to ensuring the Bureau’s investigations are driven by provable facts and evidence and not political or personal vendettas? 


  2. In your book,  Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy  , you wrote that the “deep state” is “the most dangerous threat to our democracy.”  [48]  Please explain what you meant. 


  3. In your book,  Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy  , you provided a list titled “Members of the Executive Branch Deep State.”  [49]  Please state whether you will support or recommend investigations into each and explain your reasoning. 


  4. At an October 2024 rally for President-Elect Trump, you stated “[w]e are on a mission to annihilate the deep state.”  [50]  Please explain what you meant and what steps you intend to take to do so. 


  5. As noted above, in a December 2023 podcast interview, you pledged that, should President-Elect Trump be reelected, you would “go out and find the conspirators—not just in government, but in the media,” If confirmed as Director of the FBI, will you recommend or support investigations into journalists who have published stories critical of President-Elect Trump or questioned his claim that he won the 2020 election? 



Financial Conflicts of Interest 

Also troubling is your years-long history of receiving income directly from President-Elect Trump. A June 17, 2024 public filing revealed that you were a Director on the Board of Trump Media and Technology Group,  [51]  which owns Truth Social. The filing stated that your company, Trishul, LLC, received $50,000 in 2022 and $130,000 in 2023 from Trump Media and Technology Group. Another filing reported that you “serve[d] as a national security adviser to Donald J. Trump as a private citizen and receive[d] payment for such services from Save America PAC,” which is affiliated with President-Elect Trump.  [52] 

You have made it clear through your rhetoric and actions that you are loyal to President-Elect Trump over law and facts. You stated at the Conservative Political Action Conference “[w]e’re blessed by God to have Donald Trump be our juggernaut of justice, to be our leader, to be our continued warrior in the arena.”  [53]  An FBI Director must be committed first and foremost to the truth—not to a politician or ideology. Your financial ties to President-Elect Trump only deepen my concerns regarding your nomination. Given these concerns, please answer the following questions: 

  1. Please provide a list of the companies and organizations associated with President-Elect Trump, directly or indirectly, from which you have received income for the past ten years. 


  2. If confirmed as Director of the FBI, will you commit to divesting yourself financially from President-Elect Trump and all companies and organizations associated with him? 



Conclusion 

I am deeply concerned by the variety of ways your comments and actions suggest you are unfit to lead the FBI. 

In his memoir, Former Attorney General Barr—who led the DOJ under President Trump—wrote that you “had virtually no experience that would qualify [you] to serve at the highest level of the world’s preeminent law enforcement agency.”  [54]  Your actions and rhetoric since you worked with Former Attorney General Barr appear only to confirm his concerns and demonstrate a disregard for both law enforcement and the law, an affinity for debunked and baseless conspiracy theories, and a desire to use the Bureau as a tool of political retribution. 

I request that you come to your Senate Judiciary Committee nomination hearing prepared to answer these questions and expect you to provide written answers no later than January 23, 2025. 

Sincerely,

10:51:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the following statement today applauding the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) proposed rule to require new front-of-package labels on food and beverage products with standardized, interpretive nutrition information: 

“The FDA’s proposed rule modernizes antiquated labeling systems that undercut many Americans’ ability to buy healthy food. I have long advocated for front-of-package labels to provide consumers with the straightforward, easily accessible nutrition information they deserve. I welcome today’s proposal, which will bring much-needed transparency and simplicity to Americans’ shopping experience, and I urge the incoming administration to finalize a strong rule that will put consumer interests first.” 

Blumenthal has led the charge to provide consumers with clear information about the nutritional content of foods and beverages. He has repeatedly written to the FDA alongside U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), calling for a front-of-package nutrition labeling system. 

Additionally, Blumenthal has introduced legislation with U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), the  Transparency, Readability, Understandability, Truth, and Helpfulness (TRUTH) in Labeling Act  , which would direct the FDA to develop new front-of-package labels for foods and beverages sold in the United States. He is also the author of the  Food Labeling Modernization Act  with U.S. Representative Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), which would update food labeling requirements.

10:51:44 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:51:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed President-elect Donald Trump’s presumptive nominee to be Attorney General Pam Bondi on whether she would continue the Department of Justice’s current efforts to defend a law passed overwhelmingly by Congress last year requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok. Shortly after Blumenthal’s questioning of Bondi,  the Washington Post reported  that Trump is considering an Executive Order that would suspend the enforcement of law for several months. 

The full video of Blumenthal’s questioning is  available here  and the transcript is copied below. 

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)  :  Again, thank you, Ms. Bondi, for answering our questions. 

I want to come back to TikTok, and we ran out of time when I was asking you before about the importance of the law that was passed overwhelmingly, bipartisan majority here in the United States Congress. As you know, last year, a Chinese hacking group—it was called Salt Typhoon—broke into several American phone companies, reportedly used that access to spy on the White House, the FBI, other sensitive, government targets. The threat of Chinese Communist espionage goes beyond just watching, it also involves potentially shutting down our grids, other critical infrastructure. I assume you agree with me that Chinese cyberwarfare, espionage, malign influence is an existential threat to America? 

Pam Bondi:  It is an existential threat, Senator, and also, I have not seen it yet, but from what I’ve heard about former FBI Director Wray’s comments on  60 Minutes  regarding China, sleeper cells within our own country, infiltrating our water systems, our natural gas lines, telecommunications—a very, very real threat to our country. 

Blumenthal:  I’m glad that we agree. And as you know, and as the Department of Justice has noted—it’s not classified, so we can talk about it openly— ByteDance is beholden to the demands of the Chinese government. It is controlled by the Chinese government, and it in turn controls TikTok. Do you agree that Bytedance's control, ownership, exploitation of TikTok is a threat to American national security? 

Bondi:  Senator, this is a pending litigation within the Department of Justice, and I can’t talk about that at all. 

Blumenthal:  Well let me put it a different way. It’s not pending litigation within the Department of Justice, it’s in the courts. And the Department of Justice is currently defending the constitutionality of American law— 

Bondi:  Pending— 

Blumenthal:  Will you continue to defend the law passed by the Congress, defending America's national security? 

Bondi:  Senator, I cannot…it would be irresponsible for me to talk about any—and it is pending litigation. We can talk semantics all day long— 

Blumenthal:  No, you know, I was Attorney General, and very often— 

Bondi:  I’m not trying to hedge on anything, Senator, I just can’t comment on it— 

Blumenthal:  Well, I am having a problem with the idea that you won't tell me that the Department of Justice will continue to defend against a constitutional attacks, the law of the United States. When I was Attorney General of the state of Connecticut, I would say, “I have an obligation to defend the law of Connecticut against any attacks.” You have an obligation, or you did as Attorney General of Florida, to go to court when those laws were attacked. You have an obligation as United States Attorney General to do what this Attorney General is doing, whether you agree with it or not. And frankly, whatever the President thinks about that law, you have an obligation to defend it. This is an easy question for you. Will you defend laws of the United States of America against constitutional attacks? I am asking you in general. 

Bondi:  In general, yes. 

Blumenthal:  And with respect to the law that would require the divestiture of TikTok—which is a law passed by this body and supported by I think a majority of members on both sides of the aisle—why can't you tell us that you will defend it? 

Bondi:  Senator, I'm not hedging. This is all pending litigation, and I just, I can't talk about pending litigation, if confirmed as Attorney General. 

Blumenthal:  I have to tell you, with all due respect, that answer is unacceptable to me. Thank you.

10:51:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – During today’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination of Pam Bondi to be U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) raised concerns about the future of an independent Department of Justice (DOJ) under Bondi’s leadership, pointing to her persistent denial of the 2020 election results and promises to weaponize the DOJ for President-elect Trump’s political purposes. 

“You say the right things, that you are going to be the people’s lawyer, that’s what you have to say to be here. But I believe being the people’s lawyer means you have to be able to say ‘no’ to the President of the United States. You have to speak truth to power. You have to be able to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. You dodged that question when you were asked directly by Senator Durbin. You have to be able to say that January 6 insurrectionists who committed violence should not be pardoned,”  said Blumenthal. 

Blumenthal also pressed Bondi to disavow troubling comments made by Kash Patel, President-elect Trump’s pick to be FBI Director,  “  Well, let me ask you, an individual who says that he is going to ‘come after’ people he alleges  ‘helped Joe Biden rig the presidential elections,’ that he has a list of people who are part of this deep state who should be prosecuted, that he is going to close down the FBI building on his first day in office, is that a person who appropriately should be the FBI Director? Aren’t those comments inappropriate?” 

“Well, let me just submit that the response that I would have hoped to hear from you is that those comments are inappropriate and that you will ask him to disavow or recant them when he comes before this Committee. Because they are indeed chilling to fair enforcement and the rule of law,”  Blumenthal concluded. 

Text of Blumenthal’s exchange with Bondi is copied below. Video of Blumenthal’s remarks is available for  download here  . 

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Ms. Bondi, and to your family. Thank you for visiting with me in my office. And I have to say, I am sympathetic always to a former Attorney General, particularly having been one myself, but I am, I have to say, also really troubled, deeply disturbed by some of your responses and nonresponses to the questions that you have been asked today. 

You say the right things, that you are going to be the people’s lawyer, that’s what you have to say to be here. But I believe being the people’s lawyer means you have to be able to say no to the President of the United States. You have to speak truth to power. You have to be able to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. You dodged that question when you were asked directly by Senator Durbin. You have to be able to say that January 6 insurrectionists who committed violence should not be pardoned. You have to be able to say that a nominee for the FBI Director who says he has an enemy list—and that is just the beginning of what he has said in terms of politicizing, deeply weaponizing the FBI against political opponents—that he should not be the FBI director. 

You know, we have some history here with your predecessors, Barr, Sessions, and others, who perhaps sincerely, when they sat where you are now, said that they would say no, but they were working with a President that expected them to be his Roy Cohn, his personal attorney. Do you really think that you can avoid the disgrace that they encountered? Or the repercussions from the White House if you say no to the President? And so, my question to you is, can you say no to the President of the United States when he asks you to do something unethical or illegal? 

Pam Bondi:  Senator, first I need to clarify something that you said, that I have to sit up here and say these things. No, I don’t. I sit up here and speak the truth. I am not going to sit up here and say anything that I need to say to get confirmed by this body. I do not have to say anything. I will answer the questions to the best of my ability and honestly. 

Blumenthal:  Well, let me ask you, an individual who says that he is going to “come after” people he alleges “helped Joe Biden rig the presidential elections,” that he has a list of people who are part of this deep state who should be prosecuted, that he is going to close down the FBI building on his first day in office, is that a person who appropriately should be the FBI Director? Aren’t those comments inappropriate? Shouldn’t you disavow them and ask him to recant them? 

Bondi:  Senator, I’m not familiar with all his comments. I have not discussed those comments with Mr. Patel— 

Blumenthal:  Well, I'm asking you for your view— 

Bondi:  Excuse me. What I do know, is Mr. Patel was a career prosecutor, he was a career public defender defending people, and he also has great experience within the intelligence community. What I can sit here and tell you is Mr. Patel, if he works running the FBI, if he is confirmed, and if I am confirmed, he will follow the law if I am the Attorney General of the United States of America. And I don’t believe he would do anything otherwise. 

Blumenthal:  Well, let me just submit that the response that I would have hoped to hear from you is that those comments are inappropriate and that you will ask him to disavow or recant them when he comes before this Committee. Because they are indeed chilling to fair enforcement and the rule of law.

10:51:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the below statement today after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a proposed rule to limit the level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products, including most cigars and pipe tobacco: 

“The FDA’s proposed rule to establish a low-nicotine product standard has the potential to benefit millions of Americans, save lives, and reduce smoking-related disease. Research has repeatedly shown that reducing nicotine levels could significantly increase the number of people who quit smoking as well as prevent people, especially youth and young adults, from becoming addicted to begin with. That is why I have called for a strong rule from the FDA, and why I will continue to advocate for the new administration to finalize and implement this rule and protect the public’s health.” 

Last month, Blumenthal wrote to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young and Administrator of Information and Regulatory Affairs Richard L. Revesz urging the agency to approve a proposed rule from the FDA to establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and other tobacco products. Blumenthal’s letter to OMB is  available here  .

“This historic breakthrough is powerfully heartening and hopeful. It ends unspeakable heartbreaking horror for 33 hostages and uplifts hope for a path to peace. It calls for courage to complete. Inspired by this dramatic step toward peace, the looming huge challenges ahead are surmountable: release of the remaining hostages, a permanent cessation of hostilities, humanitarian aid, and more. My hope and prayer is that this seismic progress can lead to normalization of relations between Israel and its neighbors, with a path to regional peace and stability. This goal, once seemingly unreachable, is now realistic.”

10:51:46 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:51:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – During today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the nomination of Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) raised Hegseth’s documented record of financial mismanagement and misconduct while leading two non-profit organizations. During his questions, Blumenthal entered into the record the tax forms for both organizations from during Hegseth’s tenure (available  here  and  here  ). 

“I think what we need in that position is not just better, but the best in financial management because those decisions are life and death decisions affecting the 3.4 million Americans who serve our national security and our national defense and put their lives on the line,  said Blumenthal. 

Blumenthal outlined the steep decline in revenue Hegseth oversaw at both Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America, which also ran significant deficits during Hegseth’s tenure. By the time Hegseth left Concerned Veterans of America, the organization  “had deep debts, including credit card transaction debts of about $75,000.” 

“That isn't the kind of fiscal management we want at the Department of Defense. We can't tolerate it at the Department of Defense. That’s an organization with a budget of $850 billion—not $10 or $15 million, which was the case at those two organizations—and it has command responsibility for 3.4 million Americans. The highest number that you managed in those two organizations was maybe 50 people.” 

“I don't believe that you can tell this Committee—or the people of America—that you are qualified to lead them,”  Blumenthal concluded. 

Last week, Blumenthal  wrote Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MI)  to share his concern about the Committee preparing to move forward with Hegseth’s nomination without access to full information about Hegseth’s personal conduct and previous work experience. That request followed an  earlier letter  to Committee leadership requesting that the Committee “ensure that Concerned Veterans of America (CVA) and the Veterans for Freedom (V.F.F.) preserve and produce all financial records and correspondence, particularly concerning credit card transactions, relating to Peter Hegseth’s tenure at these organizations to the Committee for review.” 

The full text of Blumenthal’s exchange with Hegseth is copied below. Video of Blumenthal’s remarks is available for  download here  . 

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT):  Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having this hearing. Thank you for being here, Mr. Hegseth, and I want to join in expressing appreciation and respect for your service to our country, and thanks to all the veterans who are here today, and thank you for your service as a Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. I hope we can focus on doing better for our veterans and doing better in management of the Department of Defense. There is always room for improvement. I think what we need in that position is not just better, but the best in financial management because those decisions are life and death decisions affecting the 3.4 million Americans who serve our national security and our national defense and put their lives on the line. 

I want to talk about financial mismanagement at the two organizations that you headed—which are the only test of your financial management that we have before this Committee—the Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. You took over the Veterans for Freedom in 2007. In 2008, you raised $8.7 million, but spent more than $9 million, creating a deficit. By January 2009, you told donors that the organization had less than $1000 in the bank and debts of $434,000. By 2010, revenue at the Veterans for Freedom had dropped to about $265,000 dollars. In the next year, it had dropped further to $22,000. You don't dispute these numbers, do you? 

Pete Hegseth:  Senator, I'm extremely proud of the work me and my fellow vets did at Vets for Freedom. A bunch of young vets with no political experience, a small group, working hard every single day– 

Blumenthal:  I apologize for interrupting— 

Hegseth:  We raised donor funds, and we have letters submitted for the record from almost everyone that worked with me every single day, including our Chief Operating Officer, who will attest that every dollar we raised was used intentionally toward the execution of our mission, which is supporting the war fighters—exactly why we are here today—the war fighters in the Iraq Surge. There was a campaign in 2008, Senator, it was Barack Obama versus John McCain— 

Blumenthal:  If I could just ask you another question— 

Hegseth:  We believed John McCain would be the right person to win, and so we spent more– 

Blumenthal:  Because I have the tax returns from that organization— 

Hegseth:  I’m glad they’re here for the record— 

Blumenthal:  which I'm going to ask to be entered into the record, Mr. Chairman. 

Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-MS):  Without objection. 

Blumenthal:  These tax returns are yours, they have your signature, and I'm going to ask that members of the Committee review them, because they are the only documents. I've asked for others. I’ve asked for the FBI report that would presumably document—it should have documented—this kind of financial mismanagement, and these are the 990's from that organization. By the year of 2011, donors had become so dissatisfied with that mismanagement, they in fact ousted you, they merged that organization with Military Families United, and thereafter, you join a second organization as Executive Director for Concerned Veterans— 

Hegseth:  In between, Senator, I went to Harvard University for two years and Afghanistan— 

Blumenthal:  I want to ask you questions. I want to ask you questions about Concerned Veterans for America. Again, another set of tax returns. The 990’s from that organization. I ask they be made part of the record, Mr. Chairman. 

Wicker:  Without objection. Both of those returns are now part of the record. 

Blumenthal:  2011 to 2016. At the end of 2013, shortfall of $130,000. At the end of 2014, shortfall of $428,000. You had a surplus the following year, but then another deficit of $437,000. By the time you left, that organization had deep debts, including credit card transaction debts of about $75,000. That isn't the kind of fiscal management we want at the Department of Defense. We can't tolerate it at the Department of Defense. That’s an organization with a budget of $850 billion—not $10 or $15 million, which was the case at those two organizations—and it has command responsibility for 3.4 million Americans. The highest number that you managed in those two organizations was maybe 50 people. Let me ask you, how many men and women now serve in the United States Army? What is its end strength? 

Hegseth:  Senator, I would like an opportunity to respond to the impugning of my leadership of a veterans organization, Concerned Veterans of America— 

Blumenthal:  We’ll, I’ve asked you a question— 

Hegseth:  You’re on the VA Committee, sir, and I appreciate your service there. The VA Accountability Act and the MISSION Act were all brain childs of Concerned Veterans for America. We used our donor money very intentionally and focused to create policy that bettered the lives of veterans. 

Blumenthal:  Mr. Hegseth, I'm asking you a very simple question. How many men and women currently serve in the United States Army? 

Hegseth:  Senator, the United States Army, 450,000 on active duty, sir. 

Blumenthal:  And how many in the Navy? 

Hegseth:  In the Navy, it’s 425, sir. 

Blumenthal:  Well, it’s 337 this year. How many in the Marine Corps? 

Hegseth:  175,000. 

Blumenthal:  172,300. Those numbers dwarf any experience you have by many multiples. I don't believe that you can tell this Committee—or the people of America—that you are qualified to lead them. I would support you as a spokesperson for the Pentagon. I don't dispute your communications skills. But I believe that we are entitled to the facts here. I've asked for more documents. I assume you would be willing to submit to an expanded FBI background check that interviews your colleagues, accountants, ex-wives, former spouses, sexual assault survivors, and others, and enable them to come forward. 

Hegseth:  Senator, I'm not in charge of FBI background checks. 

Blumenthal:  But you would submit to it and support it? 

Hegseth:  I'm not in charge of FBI background checks.

10:51:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: [HARTFORD, CT] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and U.S. Representative John B. Larson (CT-01) joined Governor Ned Lamont, CTDOT Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto, and Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam to announce $2 million in federal funding for the Connecticut Department of Transportation for the City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study. 

The federal funding comes from the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program through the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  . 

“This $2 million in federal funding is a significant milestone for  North Hartford, signaling strong support to reconnect a neighborhood that has for far too long been disconnected and divided. This investment supports a collaborative and inclusive vision that will revitalize the community, create good-paying jobs, and provide relief for residents. I’m proud to have fought for this funding and will continue to work to deliver federal resources that encourage economic development across our state,”  said Blumenthal. 

"This project is about more than just rebuilding roads in Hartford—it’s about unlocking opportunities for local communities and creating a more connected future,” said Murphy. “This $2 million in federal funding will help improve traffic flow on I-84 and enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists, while opening up space for affordable housing and strengthening our neighborhoods' resilience to climate change for generations to come,"  said Murphy. 

“With its focus on reconnecting communities, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we passed in Congress has created an opportunity to end the racial isolation in North Hartford and build a transportation system that connects residents across the Capitol Region,” said Larson. “By funding engineering efforts to realign and cap Interstate 84 in Hartford, this $2 million federal investment will move us one step close to finally fixing the egregious design flaws that have robbed our communities of their potential for far too long. Revitalization will not happen overnight, and it remains one of my top priorities to correct the injustices of the past by securing funding to modernize infrastructure and promote economic opportunity for the residents of North Hartford,”  said Larson. 

“As we are making necessary upgrades to our infrastructure, we should use this as an opportunity to review how our highways are impacting the local host communities and make adjustments that think ahead for long-term improvements with an eye toward economic growth for people who live in these neighborhoods. Our interstates have divided Hartford’s North End from the rest of the city for generations now, and this study will give those who live in the area a voice in how we can improve these roads so they work for everyone,”  said Lamont. 

“Funding for this study will help us advance the recommendations in the Greater Hartford Mobility Study as we look to reconnect the North End of Hartford to downtown, and undo some of the disruptions caused by the current highway system. Thank you to USDOT, Secretary Buttigieg, and our Congressional Delegation for the ongoing support on this project,”  said Eucalitto. 

"The City Link project represents a critical opportunity to heal historical divides in North Hartford. By reimagining our infrastructure, we're not just rebuilding roads, but reconnecting communities and creating pathways for economic opportunity. This $2 million federal investment will help us address long-standing inequities and give North Hartford residents a voice in shaping their neighborhood's future,"  said Arulampalam. 

The City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study would complete collaborative visioning and analysis and preliminary engineering for the realignment, lowering and capping of Interstate 84 and the Hartford Line rail corridor in Hartford. The surrounding neighborhoods have long experienced historic disinvestment and are home to disadvantaged communities that have borne the brunt of the negative effects associated with the construction of the original highway in the mid-20th century.

10:51:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: [HARTFORD, CT] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Joe Courtney (CT-02) applauded the U.S. Navy’s decision to name the third Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, the largest and most capable submarine built by the United States, the “USS GROTON” after Groton, Connecticut. The USS GROTON is scheduled for delivery in 2032. U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, also announced today that Cynthia Blumenthal will serve as the sponsor of the future USS Groton. Sponsors are selected by the Secretary of the Navy and hold a unique role by maintaining a lifelong relationship with the ship and crew. 

“Naming the USS GROTON recognizes this iconic Connecticut town as the submarine capitol of the world— honoring the unsurpassed skill and dedication of men and women who work there. Groton has a rich shipbuilding legacy, and proven commitment to our national defense— manufacturing and maintaining vital weapons platforms, and sustaining our undersea superiority. It is a proud community of hard workers, veterans, patriots, and public servants, and this honor celebrates them. I am proud that my wife, Cynthia, will be the sponsor of the USS GROTON and serve as a bond between the vessel, her crew, and our nation – an honor and privilege Cynthia is perfectly qualified to take on,”  said Senator Blumenthal. 

“I am tremendously honored to sponsor the future USS GROTON (SSBN-828) and look forward to building a lifelong relationship with the ship and its crew. Connecticut’s contributions to our nation’s maritime strength and national security are a source of great pride to all Nutmeggers. On behalf of Connecticut’s citizens, I thank the Secretary of the Navy for this recognition. As a military parent, I know firsthand the commitment military families make in support of their members who serve. Those families also serve. It is a privilege to be allowed to dedicate myself to both the USS GROTON and the submariners who will be deployed on her as she protects our shores and our people,”  said Cynthia Blumenthal. 

“It’s only fitting the U.S. Navy is naming our next Columbia Class submarine after Groton, Connecticut— the Submarine Capital of the World,”  said Senator Murphy.  “This is a well-deserved recognition of Groton’s rich history as a global leader in submarine technology and innovation, and a home to the thousands of Electric Boat workers and small businesses who power our nation’s naval defense. I will continue to use my seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to make sure the next administration advances our submarine programs quickly and cost-effectively, supports our maritime industrial workforce, and ensures the full and timely delivery of the cutting-edge submarines we need to uphold our national security.” 

“Today’s decision by the US Navy to honor Groton, Connecticut as the name of its next submarine is welcome news. Groton is the birthplace of the modern nuclear-powered Navy under Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and home to our nation’s oldest submarine base, as well as the Electric Boat shipyard whose talented shipbuilders have played a leading role since World War II where they constructed 74 submarines to fight the Axis powers. The naming of the third Columbia class submarine as the future USS GROTON is a well-deserved badge of honor that rightly acknowledges our community’s historic role in the United States submarine force,”  said Representative Courtney. 

Groton, Connecticut is commonly referred to as the “Submarine Capital of the World” and is home to the United States Naval Submarine Base, General Dynamics Electric Boat, and the historic USS Nautilus and Submarine Force Museum. Groton is a leader in the country in designing, manufacturing, and sustaining the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet. Groton became known as the “Submarine Capital of the World” when the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics delivered 74 diesel submarines to the Navy in World War II.

10:51:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today applauded actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to bring higher education within reach for more Rhode Islanders, including restoring the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Since 2021, more than 3,100 Rhode Islanders have benefited from actions taken by the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to fix the PSLF Program, eliminating $217 million in student loan debt. 

“Having that long-lingering student loan balance reduced to zero is lifechanging for the Rhode Islanders who my office has helped through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. I applaud the Biden-Harris administration’s legacy of delivering on the promise of this program. There is no doubt that the Administration’s efforts delivered much-needed student loan relief to families across our state, allowing them to invest in homes and in their own children’s education,”  said Whitehouse. 

The PSLF Program is designed to support teachers, service members, social workers, and others engaged in public service. For years, the program was bogged down in administrative red tape, resulting in few American receiving the loan forgiveness they were promised when they entered public service fields. After making changes to the program, the Biden-Harris administration delivered $78.5 billion in loan forgiveness through PSLF, which has benefitted more than 1 million borrowers nationwide – a stark contrast from the 7,000 applications approved under the first Trump administration. 

Whitehouse has long championed legislation to help Americans pay off their student loans. Since hearing from early applicants caught in the PSLF Program bureaucracy several years ago, Whitehouse has doggedly pursued fixes to the program and worked to help constituents navigate the application process. 

Whitehouse introduced the  Simplifying and Strengthening PSLF Act  to streamline and improve the program. In addition to making the Biden administration’s waiver permanent, the Simplifying and Strengthening PSLF Act would reduce the number of payments needed to qualify for PSLF loan forgiveness from 120 payments over 10 years to 60 payments over 5 years while working for an eligible employer. Whitehouse has also introduced the  Zero-Percent Student Loan Refinancing Act  , which would allow Americans to refinance their federal student loans at a zero percent interest rate.

10:52:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — U.S. Congressman Sean Casten (IL-06) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) sent letters to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac questioning the Enterprises on how they assess and manage climate-related risks for the home mortgage loans they purchase and hold. 

“The U.S. mortgage market faces severe challenges due to climate-related factors, including underinsurance, increasingly unaffordable or unavailable insurance, the over-representation of under-capitalized insurers in high-risk areas such as Florida, the transfer of high climate-risk mortgages to [the Enterprises], and a high percentage of GSE-backed loans without flood insurance,”  the lawmakers wrote  . “These issues are a result of the destabilizing effects of climate change. We believe that how [the Enterprises] assesses and manages these risks will be crucial in maintaining stability.” 

In recent months, Hurricane Helene’s destructive path across the Southeast has spotlighted the lack of flood insurance coverage in areas that have been historically perceived as ‘less risky.’ Less than 1% of the inland areas that sustained the most catastrophic damage were protected with flood insurance. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have identified flood insurance as an important risk mitigation measure for future climate-related losses to their portfolios. However, the GSEs require flood insurance only for their loans in high-risk areas (i.e., FEMA-designated flood zones and coastal areas), and have no stated requirement for medium and lower-risk areas, leaving homeowners unaware of potential flood risks to their property. As a result, there are serious concerns that the real estate markets have underpriced flood risk, where home values do not accurately account for future and increased costs from flooding. This is contributing to the overvaluation of homes, and any correction or home value deflation would disproportionately impact low-income households. 

Lenders have responded to this lack of insurance by selling their risky mortgages, including in coastal areas, to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in order to avoid bearing the risk that homeowners will default on their mortgages. This only shifts the risk to the federal government, and by extension, the taxpayer. In the event that the federal government needs to bail out Fannie and Freddie through a string of defaults, taxpayers would ultimately pay the price. 

Senator Whitehouse, as Chairman of the Budget Committee, last month released a first-of-its kind  public dataset and report  exposing the scale of the climate change-driven crisis in the homeowners’ insurance market. The former chief economist for Freddie Mac had warned the Budget Committee of an impending mortgage market meltdown, noting that “unlike during the experience of 2007-2008, these homeowners will have no expectation that the values of their homes will ever recover.”

10:52:02 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  – U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Andy Kim (D-NJ), and Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD-8) sent a  letter  yesterday to the 2025 Trump Vance Inaugural Committee requesting information on the Committee’s practices for identifying and screening out illegal anonymous and foreign donations. 

“Recent reporting indicates that the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee is on track to raise over $150 million. Given that a foreign national was found to have illegally donated $900,000 to the first Trump inaugural committee, and to evaluate whether additional congressional action is required to address the issue of foreign donors illegally contributing to inaugural funds, we request that the Inaugural Committee provide answers to the following questions,”  wrote the members. 

The members asked the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee for further details on procedures to ensure the accuracy of its financial disclosure reports, its measures to identify individual donors or the beneficial owners of corporate entities, its screening measures to identify donations from foreign nationals, and its processes to screen out obviously fake or anonymous donors. In 2021, a foreign national was sentenced to twelve years in prison after pleading guilty to charges that included making an illegal contribution to President-elect Trump’s first inaugural committee. 

“The public deserves a full accounting of diligence measures to ensure the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee is meeting its reporting and screening requirements for donations,”  added the members. 

Senator Whitehouse has long led the charge to end the scourge of anonymous and foreign money in American politics. The Senator’s  DISCLOSE Act  would require organizations spending money in elections – including super PACs and 501(c)(4) dark money groups – to promptly disclose donors who give $10,000 or more during an election cycle. Whitehouse and Raskin also introduced the  Get Foreign Money Out of U.S. Elections Act  , legislation that would close a major loophole in campaign finance law that allows U.S. companies appreciably owned by foreign entities to pour unlimited sums of money into American elections.

January 13, 2025 

Dear Senator Loeffler and Mr. Witkoff: 

We write to request information on the 2025 Trump Vance Inaugural Committee’s practices regarding screening contributions from foreign donors. 

Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from making, directly or indirectly, any donations to an inaugural committee.  [1]  Inaugural committees may not knowingly accept donations from foreign nationals.  [2]  Further, inaugural committees must report to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) any donation of money or anything of value aggregating $200 or more, including basic information about the donor, the amount of the donation, and the date of receipt.  [3] 

Recent reporting indicates that the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee is on track to raise over $150 million.  [4]  Given that a foreign national was found to have illegally donated $900,000 to the first Trump inaugural committee,  [5]  and to evaluate whether additional congressional action is required to address the issue of foreign donors illegally contributing to inaugural funds, we request that the Inaugural Committee provide answers to the following questions by January 21, 2025: 

  1. What measures has the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee instituted to meet its legal obligation to submit accurate financial disclosure reports to the FEC identifying the sources of the millions of dollars it raised? 


  2. What measures has the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee instituted to identify individual donors and/or ultimate beneficial owners responsible for donations made through corporate entities? 


  3. What measures has the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee instituted to identify whether a donor is a foreign national? 


  3. What processes are in place to ensure that a donor is not a foreign national, other than having the donor check a box certifying that the donor is not a foreign national and the contribution is being made from the donor’s own funds? Please provide specific information. 


  4. What processes are in place to screen for obviously fake or anonymized donor information, such as falsified names and addresses (e.g., “John Doe,” listing a NASA facility address, etc.)? Please provide specific information. 


  5. Please provide a copy of any written operating procedures regarding verification of donor information submitted to the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee. 
  6. Please provide a copy of all materials containing information about programming and benefits offered to individuals who donate to the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee. 



The public deserves a full accounting of diligence measures to ensure the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee is meeting its reporting and screening requirements for donations. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. 

Sincerely,

WASHINGTON, DC –  In an effort to strengthen Rhode Island’s workforce and create more high-paying ocean technology and ‘Blue Economy’ jobs, Rhode Island’s Congressional Delegation today announced $3.8 million to support workforce development in ocean robotics, sensors, and materials industries to meet the demands of ocean-based technology companies and their extensive supply chains within the region. 

U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo today announced that Ocean Tech Works, led by the University of Rhode Island Research Foundation, has been selected to receive a Good Jobs Challenge Grant. 

Funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), this federal job training initiative is designed to support economic development, connect people to good-paying jobs, and help underserved communities leverage regional assets. The program brings together private industry, state and local government, higher education, labor unions, nonprofit institutions, and other critical stakeholders to develop and grow innovative industries that stimulate economic growth and create good-paying jobs. 

The emerging ocean-based economy is a key economic driver for the region and the nation, creating high-quality jobs locally, while simultaneously giving the United States a competitive advantage in a global market and securing our national interests. The Ocean Tech Works project is strategically aligned with the EDA-designated Ocean Tech Hub, centered in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, and will play a pivotal role in connecting new talent pipelines to high-demand jobs in advanced materials and composites, robotics, and advanced manufacturing. 

“The Ocean Tech Works project exemplifies the collaborative spirit of both Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, uniting public, private, and educational institutions to address the workforce needs of the rapidly expanding ocean technology sector. This project will be poised to deliver great results that help more Rhode Islanders access good-paying jobs and contribute to the economic vitality of the region and nation as a whole,” said Reed, Whitehouse, Magaziner and Amo in a joint statement. 

“We are honored to receive the EDA Good Jobs Award, made possible through the support of our federal delegation” said Christian Cowan, Executive Director of Polaris MEP. “Ocean Tech Works is a regional, collaborative workforce development program dedicated to filling immediate opportunities in ocean-based jobs. This initiative is a cornerstone of our region’s expanding Blue Economy ecosystem, and we are excited to implement these programs in partnership with our public and private collaborators. 

With 2024 Good Jobs Challenge funding, Rhode Island’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center, Polaris MEP, will lead the coordination of a robust regional partnership that includes industry leaders such as New Bedford Research & Robotics and the RI Marine Trades Association, Community College of RI and Bristol Community College, UA Local 51 Plumbers & Pipefitters Union, workers’ rights organization Fuerza Laboral, and many others. This coalition will provide 400 individuals with free, accelerated skills training in occupations such as CNC machining, welding, composites, robotics, and remote-operated vehicles – positions for which local employers have indicated strong hiring needs. Additionally, the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training and the Rhode Island Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner will be critically engaged in coordinating and delivering services and wraparound support to participants.

10:52:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: In new letter, top Democratic advocates for Supreme Court transparency press Roberts and the Conference to allow for basic fact-finding in light of Justice Alito’s habit of ethically-questionable conduct 

Washington, DC  – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) sent a  letter  Friday to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the Judicial Conference urging the Court and the Conference to set up a mechanism for basic fact-finding amid swirling ethics questions that arose from a phone call between Justice Samuel Alito and President-elect Donald Trump this week. 

“Earlier this week, Justice Alito and President-elect Trump spoke on a private call by phone, while the President-elect was involved in several high-profile cases pending or likely to come before the Supreme Court, including  Donald J. Trump v. New York  and  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland  . This contact could potentially implicate provisions of the Supreme Court’s new code of conduct and of federal law… We humbly suggest that this incident provides yet another reason for the Judicial Conference and the Court to agree on some sort of neutral fact-finding when a justice’s conduct is questioned,”  wrote Whitehouse and Johnson. 

“No convincing reason exists for the Supreme Court of the United States to remain the only court in the country without an enforceable process for policing misconduct. We submit that this latest incident provides an additional reminder of the need for the Court and Conference to adopt some basic elements of legal process: a place to file complaints, a fact-finding process for credible complaints, and a neutral determination of ethical compliance,”  added Whitehouse and Johnson. 

On Wednesday,  reporting from ABC News  uncovered a phone call between Justice Alito and President-elect Trump while the President-elect was involved in cases pending or likely to come before the Court in the same week, including  Donald J. Trump v. New York  and  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland.  While Justice Alito denied that the two discussed any of these matters, Whitehouse and Johnson’s letter urges an investigation and neutral fact-finding because the Justice has shown a prior willingness to improperly discuss matters that could come before the Court. 

Days after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed Whitehouse and Johnson’s  Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency (SCERT) Act  , Justice Alito, in an unusual interview with Court Leonard Leo’s lawyer David Rivkin, stated: “I know this is a controversial view, but I’m willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.” The interview was published as an op-ed on the  Wall Street Journal  editorial page. Leo and three different right-wing billionaires’ lawyers have objected to congressional inquiries into their undisclosed gifts to right-wing justices, citing the same theory Justice Alito offered in his  Wall Street Journal  editorial page interview. 

Whitehouse  sent a letter  to Justice Alito requesting information regarding the improper comments. Whitehouse also wrote a  letter  Chief Justice Roberts to lodge an ethics complaint against Justice Alito for violating several canons of judicial ethics, and later submitted a  follow-up complaint  . 

Whitehouse and Johnson’s SCERT Act would require Supreme Court justices to adopt a binding code of conduct, create a mechanism to investigate alleged violations of the code of conduct and other laws, improve disclosure and transparency when a justice has a connection to a party or amicus before the Court, end the practice of justices ruling on their own conflicts of interests, and require justices to explain their recusal decisions to the public. 

In December, Whitehouse released a  report  that found every state supreme court (or equivalent high court) subjects its judges or justices to ethics reviews—similar to the processes that apply to all federal judges except the Supreme Court under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act. 

The text of the letter is below and a PDF of the letter is available  here  . 

January 10, 2025 

The Honorable John G. Roberts, Jr. 

Chairman, Judicial Conference of the United States 

Supreme Court of the United States 

One First St. NE 

Washington, D.C. 20543 

Dear Chairman Roberts and Members of the Conference: 

Earlier this week, Justice Alito and President-elect Trump spoke on a private call by phone, while the President-elect was involved in several high-profile cases pending or likely to come before the Supreme Court, including  Donald J. Trump v. New York  and  TikTok, Inc. v. Garland  . This contact could potentially implicate provisions of the Supreme Court’s new code of conduct and of federal law. Justice Alito has asserted that President-elect Trump called him to discuss a former law clerk’s qualification for a position in the upcoming presidential administration and denied discussing any matters related to the President-elect’s interest in matters before the Supreme Court. We humbly suggest that this incident provides yet another reason for the Judicial Conference and the Court to agree on some sort of neutral fact-finding when a justice’s conduct is questioned. 

Justice Alito has already shown that he is willing to discuss matters that may come before the Supreme Court with people who are personally involved in such matters. In 2023, Justice Alito opined in the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal that it was unconstitutional for Congress to regulate the Supreme Court at a time when we had introduced Supreme Court ethics legislation, and when the Senate was investigating undisclosed gifts by billionaires to Supreme Court justices. Moreover, this Alito interview was conducted by the lawyer for someone connected to the billionaires and who was refusing to comply with Senate information requests, arguing constitutional concerns. 

In 2022, the former leader of a right-wing judicial lobbying group alleged that two of the group’s donors learned the Supreme Court’s decision in a pending case while dining at Justice Alito’s home, an allegation which the Justice has denied. 

In both of these incidents, the Justice’s description was provided in public statements through intermediaries. Even where an investigation is cursory, it is ordinary practice to require some formal statement. A formal statement provides added assurance of the truthfulness of the statement’s content, because there are legal consequences to being untruthful in a formal statement. 

In cases where the truthfulness of a statement is subject to doubt or dispute, a neutral party (for instance, for a member of Congress, the appropriate ethics committee) would ordinarily take an independent look and evaluate any countervailing evidence. For instance, this would have been useful in the case of the upside-down flag, to reconcile the conflict between Justice Alito’s public statements through intermediaries with conflicting police reports, news stories, school schedules and calendars chronicling the incident. 

This is not a difficult problem to solve. Every one of our 50 states and the District of Columbia have a process for investigating and resolving questions of potential judicial misconduct by members of the highest court within their sovereign domain, including provisions for the taking of formal statements. The Supreme Court still has no such process. As a result, when ethical questions arise at the highest Court in the country, the public must rely solely on justices’ informal statements made through intermediaries to the press. In no other branch, office or court would such a method be adequate. Even President Biden sat for a formal statement about his Delaware presidential records. 

No convincing reason exists for the Supreme Court of the United States to remain the only court in the country without an enforceable process for policing misconduct. We submit that this latest incident provides an additional reminder of the need for the Court and Conference to adopt some basic elements of legal process: a place to file complaints, a fact-finding process for credible complaints, and a neutral determination of ethical compliance.

10:52:08 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:52:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: JOHNSTON, RI –  Overlooking the intersection of Atwood Avenue and Hartford Avenue on the steps of Johnston Town Hall, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Representative Seth Magaziner today joined Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. to deliver a $2 million federal earmark that will advance a flood mitigation project at this critical crossroad. 

Persistent and damaging flooding around Johnston Center has impacted residents and commuters for decades. The town is putting $2,080,000 in federal funds to work on a flood mitigation project to strengthen flood related infrastructure in the area and reduce the economic and environmental impacts of significant rainfall events. 

The federal earmark will help to reconfigure existing drainage infrastructure and more efficiently manage the flow of water around this intersection during and after significant rainfall events. 

“This is good news for the residents of Johnston and those who rely on this important intersection to get to school, work, the market, or any of the local stores nearby. The federal earmark I helped secure with Senator Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner will help manage flooding and reduce the impact on local roads, businesses, and homes,”  said Senator Reed  , a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who has long worked with local officials and federal agencies to address flooding in the Pocasset River Watershed. In addition to this federal earmark, Reed has helped direct an additional $12 million in federal funds to bolster flood related infrastructure and assist homeowners throughout the watershed. 

“The delegation has worked hard to make Johnston more resilient and to ensure residents have options for dealing with the frequent, severe flooding that has affected multiple areas of town,”  said Whitehouse  , Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. “We are delivering federal funding to support Mayor Polisena’s effort to help small businesses stay open, minimize storm-related property damage, and keep residents safe on the roads.” 

“Every Rhode Islander deserves to know that their families, homes, and businesses are safe from extreme weather — yet too many Johnston residents know all too well the devastating impacts of flooding to their lives and livelihoods,”  said Rep. Seth Magaziner  . “I’m proud to have partnered with Senators Reed and Whitehouse to deliver federal funding that will help mitigate flooding in Johnston and bring peace of mind to residents.” 

“Today marks a significant step forward for Johnston and our residents. This federal earmark will allow us to address the chronic flooding that has disrupted lives, businesses, and commutes for far too long. Our main intersection, where Hartford and Atwood Avenues meet, often becomes impassable during heavy rains, effectively splitting the town in two and limiting highway access. With this funding, we will implement innovative solutions like bioswales and install new piping under both streets, connecting to our existing detention ponds. While the layout of the area will look the same, its functionality during heavy rains will be vastly improved,”  said  Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr  . “I want to thank Senator Reed, Senator Whitehouse, and Congressman Magaziner for their unwavering support and collaboration in securing these funds. Together, we are making Johnston stronger, more connected, and more resilient for the future.” 

According to the Town of Johnston, chronic flooding in this area has persistently forced the closure of portions of Atwood Avenue as well as access ramps to Route 6, sometimes for days at a time. These closures have impacted residents, commuters, and the health of the local economy and environment. 

The flooding occurs when excess rain causes the Pocasset River to crest. Drainage issues along Atwood and Hartford Avenues have caused the area to be prone to flooding, with stormwater also flowing to lower-lying areas in the vicinity of Johnston Center. 

With this federal earmark, the project being carried out by the Town of Johnston will allow for the temporary storage of stormwater runoff in oversized drainage pipes until storms pass and the nearby Pocasset River returns to its normal levels. Federal funds will also be used to strengthen connections from the improved drainage system to the town’s water quality pond system. 

Johnston also plans to incorporate water quality treatment within the improved drainage system to maintain a clean, safe water supply for the surrounding communities. By protecting the quality of the town’s water supply and reducing flood-related closures and other impacts, this project will help position the town for increased economic growth. 

Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner secured this earmark in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations law.

Chairman Cotton Applauds Unanimous Supreme Court Decision to Uphold TikTok Ban 

Washington, D.C.  — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement on the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision to uphold the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. 

“ByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app. The Supreme Court correctly rejected TikTok’s lies and propaganda masquerading as legal arguments.”

Cotton Demands Army War College Refocus Priorities 

Washington, D.C.  — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today sent a letter to Army War College leaders Commandant Major General Hill and Command Sergeant Major Gregory demanding answers about an upcoming presentation titled  “Race, Gender, and Public Perceptions of Legitimate U.S. Drone Strikes: An Intersectional Approach.”  In the letter, Senator Cotton questions how such a presentation aligns with the Army’s core mission: to fight and win wars.   
  
In part, Senator Cotton wrote  : 

“The Army War College has one job: prepare our soldiers to fight and win our nation’s wars. We do not have time or resources to waste on frivolous topics that in no way advance that goal.” 

Full text of the letter may be found  here  and below. 

Commandant Major General David C. Hill 

Command Sergeant Major Charles W. Gregory Jr 

Army War College   
651 Wright Ave   
Carlisle, PA 17013-5234 

Dear Commandant Major General Hill and Command Sergeant Major Gregory, 

I write to express my concern that a professor at the Army War College is potentially conducting and promoting useless and fundamentally political research, possibly at the public’s expense. I also write to demand answers about the Army War College’s process for approving research topics and allocating resources to support those projects. 

A Lieutenant Colonel recently posted on X about an upcoming presentation to be held at the University of New Hampshire on February 10, 2025. The topic is “Race, Gender, and Public Perceptions of Legitimate U.S. Drone Strikes: An Intersectional Approach.” This topic has absolutely no bearing on the U.S. Army War College role as an institution whose stated goal is preparing Army leaders by “advancing knowledge in the global application of Landpower.” 

Please answer the following questions by January 30, 2025. 

  1. How is this research remotely useful in training future Army leaders? 
  2. Was this research approved by Army War College leadership? If so, what was the justification for doing so? Please describe the process for approving research topics and for determining if such research supports the needs of the Army. 
  3. If the research was not approved by the Army War College, why is an Army War College professor posting about this research using his Army affiliation? 



The Army War College has one job: prepare our soldiers to fight and win our nation’s wars. We do not have time or resources to waste on frivolous topics that in no way advance that goal. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. 

Sincerely, 

Tom Cotton 

United States Senator

10:52:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: CARNEGIE, PA  — Today, Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) toured the headquarters of Astrobotic, a local space robotics company that serves as a major logistics and infrastructure provider for America’s return to the moon. The company has a significant economic footprint in Western Pennsylvania and, through its contracts with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), supports the nation’s goals and interests in space. 

“It’s great to see a Western Pennsylvania company play such an important role in American space exploration,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “The innovations I saw today at Astrobotic are helping position Western PA as a critical region for America’s strategic competition in space with Communist China.” 

“Astrobotic is thrilled to showcase our groundbreaking work to lead the way in commercial space innovation to Congressman Deluzio,” said  John Thornton, Astrobotic CEO  . “Our pioneering technologies and partnerships are shaping the future while driving innovation and economic growth right here in Western Pennsylvania. With 99% of our Griffin-1 spacecraft's 514 parts machined locally, we’re proud to highlight the region’s contributions to our next Moon mission, inspiring the next generation and expanding this region’s role in the commercial space industry.” 

Astrobotic is the largest NASA contractor in Pennsylvania by revenue, with over 30 active contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) worth over $600 million. It has 250+ full time employees, most of whom are based in Pittsburgh. Two of its larger projects, the Griffin Mission One lunar lander/spacecraft and the CubeRover-1, are 99% and 87% machined in Pennsylvania, respectively. The company’s broader economic impact extends to 158 Pennsylvania-based contractors and vendors.

10:52:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today,  Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) and Congressman Morgan Luttrell (TX-8) introduced the bipartisan  Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act.  This legislation would support efforts to combat human and sex trafficking nationwide by making these initiatives eligible for funding through a critical federal grant program for state and local governments—the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. 

“The folks in Western Pennsylvania who sent me to Congress expect me to do all I can to make our communities safer,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “That’s why I am glad to join Congressman Luttrell to co-lead the  Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act  to direct more federal resources to fight the source of human trafficking across America.” 

“Human trafficking is a heinous crime that has invaded communities across our nation, and Texas currently ranks as the number two state in America for this abuse,”  said Congressman Luttrell.  “Tragically, the situation was further exacerbated as cartels exploited our open border. We must draw a hard line, and this legislation will provide law enforcement the resources to do just that. Human traffickers cannot be allowed to terrorize and exploit our communities any longer.” 

The  JAG Program  (link is external)  is the primary provider of federal criminal justice funding to state and local jurisdictions. The JAG Program currently provides state and local governments with critical funding necessary to support a range of program areas, including law enforcement, prosecution and court programs, drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and mental health programs. Congressman Deluzio’s legislation amends the  Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968  to add another category of eligible initiatives to the JAG Program—those to combat human and sex trafficking.

10:52:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) celebrated $6.9 million in federal funds to build-out new local Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure across the region that will help improve air quality. More than four million dollars in Federal Highway Administration money will support the installation of 150 new level 2 EV charging ports across 35 sites on public property throughout Allegheny and Beaver Counties. And $2.8 million from the Environmental Protection Agency will provide 10 zero-emission electric school buses to the Penn Hills School District, along with charging infrastructure. 

“I’ve got four kids at home. Like all parents, the most important thing I can do is make sure that they have a safe, bright future,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “That’s why I’ve gone to the mat to bring home funding to Western PA for projects like these EV investments to clean up our air. The funding I’m announcing today will help reduce air pollution, build out EV infrastructure, and create good-paying union jobs in the building trades..” 

“I am proud to announce that Allegheny County has received this much-needed funding to expand EV charging infrastructure,” said  Congresswoman Summer Lee  . “This grant will help accelerate the transition to clean energy and promote sustainable transportation across our region. Not only will it improve access to EV charging stations for residents, but it will also create critical infrastructure to support the growing number of electric vehicles on the road. This is an investment in our future, in cleaner air, and in the economic growth of our communities, and I’m excited that my team and I were able to help get this one over the finish line.” 

The following nine municipalities in Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District will see new public EV chargers installed: Beaver Falls, Carnegie, Coraopolis, Crafton, Edgewood, Forest Hills, Green Tree, Mt. Lebanon, and Sharpsburg. The project, funded through the  Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program  (link is external)  , is being implemented by 20 local partners, including CONNECT, Duquesne Light, Pittsburgh Region Clean Cities, the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parking Authority, Allegheny County Airport Authority, and 14 municipalities across Allegheny and Beaver Counties. 

Separately, Penn Hills School District is receiving $2.8 million through the  EPA’s Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Grant Program  (link is external)  , created by the  Inflation Reduction Act  . The funds will be used to replace ten diesel school buses with ten zero-emission electric school buses, along with 10 fast charging stations and the electrical infrastructure to support them. This follows  an announcement this past summer  (link is external)  of $10.57 million for 38 new electric buses across three other school districts in Pennsylvania’s 17  th  Congressional District. 

“These investments keep our kids healthy today and build a safer, more sustainable tomorrow,” said  Congressman Deluzio  .

10:52:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Navy and Iraq War veteran Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) placed an opinion piece in  The Hill  on December 29, 2024 warning that the VA is being hollowed out in favor of private profits. The piece “The GOP is waging a stealth attack on veterans’ healthcare” builds off of two Republican-led proposals that would, “strip the VA of its core functions, reducing it to little more than a checkbook for private-sector (and less accountable) providers.” 

In the 119  th  Congress, Congressman Deluzio will continue to defend the VA healthcare of his fellow veterans. He will always call out the fiscally reckless and worse-quality care that those with something to gain from this privatization agenda are pushing. 

The Congressman’s  full Op-Ed is available here  (link is external)  , and below. 

The Hill: The GOP is waging a stealth attack on veterans’ healthcare 

Fellow veterans: our healthcare is under attack. 

Republicans launched an unprecedented assault on the Department of Veterans Affairs’s healthcare system earlier this month with devastating bills that would gut it from the inside out. This isn’t reform: it’s demolition and privatization. And it is fiscally reckless. 

The architects of this attack are following the lead of  Concerned Veterans for America  (link is external)  , a Koch-backed outfit that has long plotted VA privatization. Feel-good buzzwords mask the ongoing takedown of the very system that millions of my fellow veterans and I rely on. Despite the slick marketing attempt, the proposals would strip the VA of its core functions, reducing it to little more than a checkbook for private-sector (and less accountable) providers. 

The VA consistently matches or beats private-sector care in quality and patient satisfaction. It has built-in oversight that continually seeks improvement and accountability when things aren’t working well. But despite this reality, those with something to gain from this privatization agenda would rather lose that oversight, preferring to farm veterans out to lower-quality private providers instead of investing in the VA. 

Republican politicians’ stance on VA spending has become an exercise in fiscal fantasy. They are carelessly pushing for unlimited private-sector siphoning of VA funds, consequences be damned. A March 2024  report  (link is external)  authored by six independent healthcare experts laid bare an alarming reality: external private-sector spending is ballooning by 15-20 percent annually, an unsustainable rate that threatens to bleed the VA system dry. 

Rather than heed these warnings, my Republican colleagues are doubling down on the very policies that endanger the system. Four of the proposed bills don’t just ignore the report’s findings — they actively accelerate the problem by pushing more veterans and pumping more money into pricier, private care with far less oversight. 

When funding is shifted from the VA into private providers without replacement, VA facilities must cut staffing and programs that my fellow veterans rely on. If we don’t act soon, the VA will be turned into another insurance company. Two of the bills, the deceptively named  Complete the Mission  (link is external)  and  Veterans Health Care Freedom  (link is external)  Acts, have provisions that would do just that. 

The VA is being hollowed out in favor of profits. This isn’t fiscal conservatism; it’s a deliberate choice to weaken and replace a valued public healthcare system with a more expensive and worse private alternative. It’s like watching someone respond to warnings about a leaking boat by drilling more holes in the hull. And with Republicans about to gain control of  all three branches of government  (link is external)  and wielding  Project 2025  (link is external)  as their blueprint, the danger has never been more real. 

Take the Trump administration’s  proposed Department of Government Efficiency  (link is external)  , or DOGE. I am all for protecting public money — I have a record of  fighting against defense contractors  price gouging our military. But what I am not for is DOGE taking a hacksaw to veterans’ healthcare. The leaders of the new department are proposing cutting up to  $119 billion  (link is external)  from the VA and its healthcare program. If their vision comes to pass, it will essentially eliminate all types of healthcare, including primary, surgical, specialty, dental and mental health care — and a heck of a lot more. 

From these dangerous proposals to the pipeline-to-privatization bills the Congress heard this month, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Three and a half million veterans get all their healthcare in-house at the VA. Many of these veterans have service-related disabilities, and these bills would risk eliminating access to the specialized care they earned. The reality is, many civilian providers are not fully equipped to handle complex war injuries, toxic exposure cases or traumatic brain injuries. That’s where the VA comes in. 

Veterans are crystal clear about where we stand. The Veterans of Foreign Wars’ own  survey  (link is external)  shows that veterans overwhelmingly support keeping the VA as their primary healthcare provider. The Disabled American Veterans testified the same. But the bill’s backers aren’t listening to the voices of veterans and these trusted veterans service organizations. 

Selling off the VA betrays veterans who sacrificed for this nation. We didn’t serve only to come home and watch politicians dismantle the VA. Patriotic Americans should not let this existential attack slip by unnoticed. The time to speak up is now. 

I hope my fellow veterans will join me demanding that Congress reject these bills that would pull our healthcare system apart. Caring for veterans is part of the cost of war, and the American people expect us to pay it.

10:52:21 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Today on the floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) called on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to root out President Biden’s wasteful student loan forgiveness scam after the administration announced additional student loan cancellations this week. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found  here  . 

“Now this is not really a cancelation of those loans, it’s just a transfer of the responsibility to taxpayers and wiping the slate clean for people who actually agreed to borrow this money.” 

“The Biden administration, never to be one that actually obeys the law, has continued to ignore the ruling of the Supreme Court, issuing a blank check after blank check to borrowers to let them off the hook from paying bills that they agreed to pay in the first instance. This policy is not just illegal, it’s profoundly unfair.” 

“Student loan socialism would be a great opportunity for the Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to take a look at because there’s nothing less efficient and more wasteful and more unfair than taking billions of dollars from taxpayers who didn’t go to college to pay for those who did.” 

“If we want to address the affordability of college—an important topic—widespread student loan socialism is not the way to do it.”

10:52:25 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Today on the floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) condemned the outgoing Biden administration’s progressive energy regulations, which are resulting in record-high electricity prices for American consumers, and discussed Republicans’ plans to roll back these misguided regulations using resolutions of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act  . Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found  here  . 

“We only have four more days of President Biden’s absentee leadership, but he seems to be making the most of his final days as he goes out the door.” 

“Americans have been suffering under high prices for energy under President Biden’s presidency. Electricity prices have risen more than 30 percent.” 

“These high prices are the direct result of President Biden’s policies, which put climate activists in the front seat while working families are left behind.” 

“The day after Christmas, President Biden’s energy department finalized new climate regulations that would functionally ban almost all-natural gas-powered water heaters.” 

“The households affected are largely low-income and senior citizens on a fixed income.” 

“Is there no home appliance or device that’s safe from this radical agenda?” 

“The Biden administration has targeted gas-powered cars, gas stoves, water heaters, and now they want to get after our lawn mowers and leaf blowers.” 

“Republicans are taking note. We know that with President Trump being sworn into office next Monday, with new majorities in the House and the Senate, that things are going to change.” 

“I’m glad we’re going to be able to focus soon, after we confirm President Trump’s cabinet, on Congressional Review Act regulatory disapprovals. I plan on introducing a few of these myself so we can reverse many of the Biden administration’s misguided regulations.” 

“President Biden may have been busy over the last few months since the November 5 election, but we are gearing up to be even busier undoing much of the mischief that he has wrought during these last couple of months on his way out the door.”

Excerpts from his remarks are below, and video can be found  here  . 

“It’s a pleasure to be here today to introduce my friend and fellow Texan, Scott Turner, to be the next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and thank you for allowing me the honor of just saying a few words.” 

“Scott is a fourth-generation Texan. That’s a big deal in Texas.” 

“He’s an accomplished leader and dedicated public servant. He was elected to the statehouse in Texas in 2012, and he went on to serve at the White House under President Trump as Executive Director of the Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The Council was established by President Trump in 2018 to carry out the implementation of the bipartisan opportunity zones, which were passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to promote investment in areas that need revitalization.” 

“He’s also an active member in his community. Scott founded a nonprofit called the Community Engagement and Opportunity Council to support impoverished children.” 

“He also served as an associate pastor at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas. Scott currently serves as Chair of the Center for Education Opportunity for the America First Policy Institute.” 

“His business acumen, his experience in government, especially with the first Trump administration, and his demonstrated ability to use housing and development to create brighter prospects for his fellow Americans makes him eminently qualified to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.” 

“It is my honor to support his nomination.” 

“I hope you will vote his nomination out of the committee promptly so we can get him confirmed and put him to work.”

Cornyn last Congress. Excerpts are below, and video can be found  here  . 

On Scott Bessent’s Nomination: 

CORNYN:  “I happen to represent a state that has the eighth largest economy in the world… We understand the formula for economic growth and prosperity and opportunity, which are low taxes, a reasonable, modest regulatory footprint, and opportunities for people to prosper.” 

“There’s a lot Washington can learn from that formula, and it sounds to me like you agree.” 

“I’m grateful for your nomination, and I think you are exactly the type of individual that needs to serve in this important position, and I support your nomination wholeheartedly.” 

On Threats Posed By Outbound Investments: 

CORNYN:  “You appropriately mentioned China as one of our biggest challenges.” 

“It’s pretty clear to me that U.S. investments have fueled China’s economic growth.” 

“I’ve introduced a bill that would require transparency of American companies investing in China… What’s your view of an outbound investment transparency requirement?” 

BESSENT:  “This is a very important issue… The Chinese economy is the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in the history of the world. They are using their surpluses to fund their military machine in China.” 

“We should have a very rigorous screening process for, as you identified, anything that could be used in AI, in quantum computing, in surveillance, in CHIPS—that the U.S. has the lead, and we must make sure that we maintain it through smart policies, such as you and I discussed.”

10:52:28 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Yesterday on the floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) proposed an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  that would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal immigrants who assault a member of law enforcement. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 70-25. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found  here  . 

“I want to offer an amendment that would add one more crime to the list covered by this legislation, that would be assault of a law enforcement officer.” 

“Anyone who comes into the country illegally and harms these brave men and women in uniform is dangerous, and dangerous not only to our first responders, but also to the safety and security of all Texans and communities all around the country.” 

“Unfortunately, we know under the Biden-Harris administration, these people that are committing these kinds of crimes are routinely being released back into the streets, as we saw last February in New York City when seven people were arrested for assaulting a police officer—assaulting multiple police officers—outside of a migrant shelter in Times Square.” 

“Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg made the decision to release five of these criminal suspects without bail. There is no question that these criminals should have been detained and removed before they could go on and commit other crimes against innocent victims.” 

“My amendment simply would require ICE to promptly take migrants who assault law enforcement officers into custody and ensure that illegal migrants who commit crimes against the men and women in blue are swiftly detained so they can be removed from our country.”

“As of November 2024, Mexico is over a million acre-feet in arrears for the current five-year cycle, despite the cycle being more than 80% complete. Unfortunately, without consistent deliveries, water shortages significantly impact agricultural stakeholders in South Texas, greatly straining Texas farmers and ranchers and jeopardizing their livelihoods and economic stability,”  the lawmakers wrote. 

“As the nominee for Secretary of State, your leadership can critically reinforce the importance that Mexico provides consistent water deliveries pursuant to the Treaty. We request a renewed effort to negotiate fair provisions guaranteeing Mexico provide annual water deliveries, similar to the annual deliveries required by America to Mexico in the same Treaty,”  they continued. 

“An increased focus on monitoring and regular reporting, as well as stronger accountability mechanisms, such as the withholding of certain forms of aid to Mexico, may provide sufficient leverage to achieve our objectives and protect the interest of our citizens along the border,”  the lawmakers concluded. 

During  Sen. Rubio’s confirmation hearing  before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Cornyn questioned Rubio about how he would handle Mexico’s ongoing violation of the 1944 Water Treaty and advocate for agricultural communities impacted in South Texas.

January 14, 2025 

The Honorable Marco Rubio 

Nominee for Secretary of State 

United States Senate 

284 Russell Senate Office Building 

Washington, D.C. 20510 

Dear Senator Rubio: 

We are writing to draw your attention to the 1944 Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico, which is vital for ensuring equitable water distribution along the Rio Grande and for supporting the agricultural, municipal, and industrial needs of both countries. 

Under this treaty, Mexico must deliver 1,750,000 acre-feet of water during each five-year cycle to supplement the Rio Grande’s water supply. While that obligation amounts to an annual average of 350,000 acre-feet of water, Mexico has failed to uphold the spirit of the Treaty: As of November 2024, Mexico is over a million acre-feet in arrears for the current five-year cycle, despite the cycle being more than 80% complete. Unfortunately, without consistent deliveries, water shortages significantly impact agricultural stakeholders in South Texas, greatly straining Texas farmers and ranchers and jeopardizing their livelihoods and economic stability. 

Dr. Maria Giner, Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), recently negotiated a “Minute” with Mexico aimed at addressing these ongoing challenges. The Minute includes measures such as accelerated water ownership transfers from Mexico to the United States within the Amistad and Falcon Reservoirs, the issuance of water “credits” from the United States to Mexico to incentivize early water deliveries, and Mexico providing water from the San Juan and Alamo Rivers to cover its Treaty shortfalls. While these revisions are a step forward, they do not guarantee timely, reliable and consistent compliance with the Treaty, and so the risk of water shortages for Americans remains. 

As the nominee for Secretary of State, your leadership can critically reinforce the importance that Mexico provides consistent water deliveries pursuant to the Treaty. We request a renewed effort to negotiate fair provisions guaranteeing Mexico provide annual water deliveries, similar to the annual deliveries required by America to Mexico in the same Treaty. An increased focus on monitoring and regular reporting, as well as stronger accountability mechanisms, such as the withholding of certain forms of aid to Mexico, may provide sufficient leverage to achieve our objectives and protect the interest of our citizens along the border. 

Thank you for your attention on this issue, and we look forward to your leadership in addressing this vital matter. 

Sincerely,

10:52:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Today during the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s hearing on the nomination of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to be U.S. Secretary of State under the incoming Trump administration, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed with Sen. Rubio his commitment to pressuring Mexico to fulfill its obligations under the Treaty Relating to the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande and the need for  outbound investment provisions  like those introduced by Sen. Cornyn last Congress. Excerpts are below, and video can be found  here  . 

On the U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty: 

CORNYN:  “I have complete confidence in your ability to lead the State Department.” 

“[In] 1944, there was a water treaty between the United States and Mexico, and we have had chronic problems getting Mexico to cooperate and release the water that’s been absolutely critical to the life and the livelihood of our agriculture community in the Rio Grande Valley and elsewhere.” 

“I would just like to get your commitment to work with us to try to just simply get Mexico to live up to its requirements under the treaty, and if they won’t do it voluntarily, to look for leverage and ways we can persuade them to do what they already have a legal obligation to do, which is to release water on a timely basis.” 

RUBIO:  “Absolutely… It has real implications not just for the state of Texas, but broadly for the United States.” 

On Outbound Investment Transparency: 

CORNYN:  “As you know, the Senate has passed legislation providing for a reporting requirement for American companies who are investing in China.” 

“I could care less whether American companies want to build more Burger Kings or Starbucks in China, but I do care if American companies are investing in dual-purpose technology or in ways that would undermine the national security of the United States. Do you share that concern?” 

RUBIO:  “Absolutely… You’re right. Every sector is not created equal, in terms of the threat they pose to our country, but at a minimum, we should have insight into whether American investment dollars—be the institutional or individual—are going through the funding of activities designed to undermine the United States of America. That’s a core national security interest.”

Excerpts are below, and video can be found  here  . 

On Department of Justice Weaponization: 

CORNYN:  “Your testimony is music to my ears.” 

“One of the things that I have been most concerned about over the last, certainly the last four years and extending back during President Trump’s administration, is the weaponization and politicization of the Department of Justice… That disturbs me greatly, and I know it does you, too.” 

On the Biden Administration’s Failed Border Policies: 

CORNYN:  “I believe President Biden and Vice President Harris had presided over one of the biggest humanitarian and public safety disasters in American history.” 

“Will you do everything within your power as Attorney General to enforce the laws on the book, including the President’s executive orders, which I anticipate he will be signing on January 20th when he is sworn in, and help do everything you can and the Department of Justice can… to restore security to our southern border?” 

BONDI:  “Yes, Senator. Absolutely.” 

CORNYN:  “Do you believe Laken Riley would be alive today if President Biden and Vice President Harris had enforced the law and secured the border?” 

BONDI:  “Senator, he should not have been in our country, and then Laken Riley would have been alive.” 

“There are so many victims throughout our country. Not only that, we’re all familiar with the violent gangs who are coming into our country, walking into our country freely through the open border.” 

“It is my commitment to you on both sides of the aisle that I will do everything in my power with the agencies that fall under me, if I am confirmed, to make America safe again.”

“I will support Pete Hegseth. This is a hard process on him and his family, and some of it will be enormously unfair, but I respect his willingness to serve the nation and the military that he has devoted a large percentage of his life to.” 

“The Pentagon needs shaking up from the dangerous status quo, and I’m confident Pete will do just that.”

10:52:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: CARNEGIE, PA  — Today, Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) toured the headquarters of Astrobotic, a local space robotics company that serves as a major logistics and infrastructure provider for America’s return to the moon. The company has a significant economic footprint in Western Pennsylvania and, through its contracts with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), supports the nation’s goals and interests in space. 

“It’s great to see a Western Pennsylvania company play such an important role in American space exploration,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “The innovations I saw today at Astrobotic are helping position Western PA as a critical region for America’s strategic competition in space with Communist China.” 

“Astrobotic is thrilled to showcase our groundbreaking work to lead the way in commercial space innovation to Congressman Deluzio,” said  John Thornton, Astrobotic CEO  . “Our pioneering technologies and partnerships are shaping the future while driving innovation and economic growth right here in Western Pennsylvania. With 99% of our Griffin-1 spacecraft's 514 parts machined locally, we’re proud to highlight the region’s contributions to our next Moon mission, inspiring the next generation and expanding this region’s role in the commercial space industry.” 

Astrobotic is the largest NASA contractor in Pennsylvania by revenue, with over 30 active contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) worth over $600 million. It has 250+ full time employees, most of whom are based in Pittsburgh. Two of its larger projects, the Griffin Mission One lunar lander/spacecraft and the CubeRover-1, are 99% and 87% machined in Pennsylvania, respectively. The company’s broader economic impact extends to 158 Pennsylvania-based contractors and vendors.

10:52:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today,  Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) and Congressman Morgan Luttrell (TX-8) introduced the bipartisan  Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act.  This legislation would support efforts to combat human and sex trafficking nationwide by making these initiatives eligible for funding through a critical federal grant program for state and local governments—the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. 

“The folks in Western Pennsylvania who sent me to Congress expect me to do all I can to make our communities safer,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “That’s why I am glad to join Congressman Luttrell to co-lead the  Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act  to direct more federal resources to fight the source of human trafficking across America.” 

“Human trafficking is a heinous crime that has invaded communities across our nation, and Texas currently ranks as the number two state in America for this abuse,”  said Congressman Luttrell.  “Tragically, the situation was further exacerbated as cartels exploited our open border. We must draw a hard line, and this legislation will provide law enforcement the resources to do just that. Human traffickers cannot be allowed to terrorize and exploit our communities any longer.” 

The  JAG Program  (link is external)  is the primary provider of federal criminal justice funding to state and local jurisdictions. The JAG Program currently provides state and local governments with critical funding necessary to support a range of program areas, including law enforcement, prosecution and court programs, drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and mental health programs. Congressman Deluzio’s legislation amends the  Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968  to add another category of eligible initiatives to the JAG Program—those to combat human and sex trafficking.

10:52:38 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) celebrated $6.9 million in federal funds to build-out new local Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure across the region that will help improve air quality. More than four million dollars in Federal Highway Administration money will support the installation of 150 new level 2 EV charging ports across 35 sites on public property throughout Allegheny and Beaver Counties. And $2.8 million from the Environmental Protection Agency will provide 10 zero-emission electric school buses to the Penn Hills School District, along with charging infrastructure. 

“I’ve got four kids at home. Like all parents, the most important thing I can do is make sure that they have a safe, bright future,” said  Congressman Deluzio  . “That’s why I’ve gone to the mat to bring home funding to Western PA for projects like these EV investments to clean up our air. The funding I’m announcing today will help reduce air pollution, build out EV infrastructure, and create good-paying union jobs in the building trades..” 

“I am proud to announce that Allegheny County has received this much-needed funding to expand EV charging infrastructure,” said  Congresswoman Summer Lee  . “This grant will help accelerate the transition to clean energy and promote sustainable transportation across our region. Not only will it improve access to EV charging stations for residents, but it will also create critical infrastructure to support the growing number of electric vehicles on the road. This is an investment in our future, in cleaner air, and in the economic growth of our communities, and I’m excited that my team and I were able to help get this one over the finish line.” 

The following nine municipalities in Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District will see new public EV chargers installed: Beaver Falls, Carnegie, Coraopolis, Crafton, Edgewood, Forest Hills, Green Tree, Mt. Lebanon, and Sharpsburg. The project, funded through the  Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program  (link is external)  , is being implemented by 20 local partners, including CONNECT, Duquesne Light, Pittsburgh Region Clean Cities, the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parking Authority, Allegheny County Airport Authority, and 14 municipalities across Allegheny and Beaver Counties. 

Separately, Penn Hills School District is receiving $2.8 million through the  EPA’s Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Grant Program  (link is external)  , created by the  Inflation Reduction Act  . The funds will be used to replace ten diesel school buses with ten zero-emission electric school buses, along with 10 fast charging stations and the electrical infrastructure to support them. This follows  an announcement this past summer  (link is external)  of $10.57 million for 38 new electric buses across three other school districts in Pennsylvania’s 17  th  Congressional District. 

“These investments keep our kids healthy today and build a safer, more sustainable tomorrow,” said  Congressman Deluzio  .

10:52:39 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Navy and Iraq War veteran Congressman Chris Deluzio (PA-17) placed an opinion piece in  The Hill  on December 29, 2024 warning that the VA is being hollowed out in favor of private profits. The piece “The GOP is waging a stealth attack on veterans’ healthcare” builds off of two Republican-led proposals that would, “strip the VA of its core functions, reducing it to little more than a checkbook for private-sector (and less accountable) providers.” 

In the 119  th  Congress, Congressman Deluzio will continue to defend the VA healthcare of his fellow veterans. He will always call out the fiscally reckless and worse-quality care that those with something to gain from this privatization agenda are pushing. 

The Congressman’s  full Op-Ed is available here  (link is external)  , and below. 

The Hill: The GOP is waging a stealth attack on veterans’ healthcare 

Fellow veterans: our healthcare is under attack. 

Republicans launched an unprecedented assault on the Department of Veterans Affairs’s healthcare system earlier this month with devastating bills that would gut it from the inside out. This isn’t reform: it’s demolition and privatization. And it is fiscally reckless. 

The architects of this attack are following the lead of  Concerned Veterans for America  (link is external)  , a Koch-backed outfit that has long plotted VA privatization. Feel-good buzzwords mask the ongoing takedown of the very system that millions of my fellow veterans and I rely on. Despite the slick marketing attempt, the proposals would strip the VA of its core functions, reducing it to little more than a checkbook for private-sector (and less accountable) providers. 

The VA consistently matches or beats private-sector care in quality and patient satisfaction. It has built-in oversight that continually seeks improvement and accountability when things aren’t working well. But despite this reality, those with something to gain from this privatization agenda would rather lose that oversight, preferring to farm veterans out to lower-quality private providers instead of investing in the VA. 

Republican politicians’ stance on VA spending has become an exercise in fiscal fantasy. They are carelessly pushing for unlimited private-sector siphoning of VA funds, consequences be damned. A March 2024  report  (link is external)  authored by six independent healthcare experts laid bare an alarming reality: external private-sector spending is ballooning by 15-20 percent annually, an unsustainable rate that threatens to bleed the VA system dry. 

Rather than heed these warnings, my Republican colleagues are doubling down on the very policies that endanger the system. Four of the proposed bills don’t just ignore the report’s findings — they actively accelerate the problem by pushing more veterans and pumping more money into pricier, private care with far less oversight. 

When funding is shifted from the VA into private providers without replacement, VA facilities must cut staffing and programs that my fellow veterans rely on. If we don’t act soon, the VA will be turned into another insurance company. Two of the bills, the deceptively named  Complete the Mission  (link is external)  and  Veterans Health Care Freedom  (link is external)  Acts, have provisions that would do just that. 

The VA is being hollowed out in favor of profits. This isn’t fiscal conservatism; it’s a deliberate choice to weaken and replace a valued public healthcare system with a more expensive and worse private alternative. It’s like watching someone respond to warnings about a leaking boat by drilling more holes in the hull. And with Republicans about to gain control of  all three branches of government  (link is external)  and wielding  Project 2025  (link is external)  as their blueprint, the danger has never been more real. 

Take the Trump administration’s  proposed Department of Government Efficiency  (link is external)  , or DOGE. I am all for protecting public money — I have a record of  fighting against defense contractors  price gouging our military. But what I am not for is DOGE taking a hacksaw to veterans’ healthcare. The leaders of the new department are proposing cutting up to  $119 billion  (link is external)  from the VA and its healthcare program. If their vision comes to pass, it will essentially eliminate all types of healthcare, including primary, surgical, specialty, dental and mental health care — and a heck of a lot more. 

From these dangerous proposals to the pipeline-to-privatization bills the Congress heard this month, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Three and a half million veterans get all their healthcare in-house at the VA. Many of these veterans have service-related disabilities, and these bills would risk eliminating access to the specialized care they earned. The reality is, many civilian providers are not fully equipped to handle complex war injuries, toxic exposure cases or traumatic brain injuries. That’s where the VA comes in. 

Veterans are crystal clear about where we stand. The Veterans of Foreign Wars’ own  survey  (link is external)  shows that veterans overwhelmingly support keeping the VA as their primary healthcare provider. The Disabled American Veterans testified the same. But the bill’s backers aren’t listening to the voices of veterans and these trusted veterans service organizations. 

Selling off the VA betrays veterans who sacrificed for this nation. We didn’t serve only to come home and watch politicians dismantle the VA. Patriotic Americans should not let this existential attack slip by unnoticed. The time to speak up is now. 

I hope my fellow veterans will join me demanding that Congress reject these bills that would pull our healthcare system apart. Caring for veterans is part of the cost of war, and the American people expect us to pay it.

10:52:41 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:52:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC -  Today, Congressman Van Drew announced Saketh Agava and Prathik Agava as the winners of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for New Jersey's 2nd District with their app, Gift8. The Congressional App Challenge is a nationwide competition where middle and high school students create original apps to showcase their coding skills and creativity. It is designed to encourage students to learn to code and to consider careers in computer science. 

Saketh and Prathik created Gift8 after being inspired by their time volunteering with a hospice patient. The app is designed to help people stay connected with loved ones by encouraging users to spend eight minutes a day reaching out to family or friends. Gift8 helps users prioritize important relationships by setting up reminders, providing articles on social connection and mental health, and making it easy to send messages directly in the app. 

"I am so proud of Saketh and Prathik for creating such a thoughtful and inspiring app," said Congressman Van Drew. "Gift8 is a great example of how technology can be used to make a real difference in people's lives. It is amazing to see young people in our district using their talents to tackle big issues like loneliness and mental health. Congratulations to Saketh, Prathik, and all the incredible students who took part in this year's competition. The creativity and hard work we saw from all of our students this year was outstanding. They give me so much hope for the future and I cannot wait to see what they accomplish next."

10:52:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC -  Today, Congressman Van Drew announced that he has been working closely with President Trump on drafting an executive order that would halt offshore wind turbine activities along the East Coast and lay the groundwork for permanent measures against the projects. The proposed order is expected to be finalized within the first few months of the administration. 

"These offshore wind projects should have never been approved in the first place," said Congressman Van Drew. "The Biden administration rammed them through the approval process without proper oversight, transparent lease agreements, or a full understanding of their devastating consequences. They are an economic and environmental disaster waiting to happen. The Biden administration's reckless green agenda put politics over people, and that ends now. President Trump is committed to stopping these harmful projects and is taking decisive action. This executive order is just the beginning. We will fight tooth and nail to prevent this offshore wind catastrophe from wreaking havoc on the hardworking people who call our coastal towns home."

10:52:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  \- Today, Congressman Adrian Smith (R-NE) released the following statement after the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced new binding interpretations of key provisions within the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA). 

"USTR did not conduct its due diligence before entering this binding agreement during the final moments of a lame duck presidency. Robust engagement over priorities for negotiating new or improved comprehensive trade agreements would have been welcome earlier in President Biden’s term. Instead, this rushed and performative action is indicative of the Biden administration's failures to consult Congress and American stakeholders while properly engaging on trade matters." 

BACKGROUND: 

In December 2024 Smith  spoke out  after it was reported USTR was attempting to renegotiate provisions of USMCA and the U.S.-Colombia TPA without consulting Congress or American stakeholders. 

On January 10, 2025, Smith led several Ways and Means Committee colleagues sending a  letter  to USTR Ambassador Katherine Tai. The letter called on USTR to refrain from finalizing any new terms for the U.S.-Colombia TPA and instead use President Biden's remaining days in office to seek input from Congress and American stakeholders. 

Smith was has been active on the Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Trade to support robust trade engagement with Colombia  since 2011  .

10:52:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:52:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Today, Reps. Adrian Smith (R-NE) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) reintroduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 96-Hour rule for Critical Access Hospitals. 

The members released the following statements: 

“Ensuring unnecessary red tape does not prevent hospitals from providing the care patients need is essential,”  said Rep. Smith.  “This bill would provide a permanent solution to protect patients and providers from the burdensome 96-hour rule in rural areas where access to care is challenging enough. I thank Rep. Sewell for working with me on this.” 

“Far too many of Alabama’s rural hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open, putting at risk the health and well-being of our communities,”  said Rep. Sewell.  “Our Critical Access Hospital Relief Act would provide urgently needed relief so that critical access hospitals can keep their doors open and focus on caring for patients instead of complying with burdensome and outdated payment rules.” 

The Critical Access Hospital Relief Act would repeal the 96-hour rule, which requires physicians at Critical Access Hospitals to certify at the time of admission a patient on Medicare will be discharged or transferred within 96 hours. Providers who fail to comply would risk non-reimbursement. 

The legislation is supported by the Nebraska Hospital Association (NHA) and the American Hospital Association (AHA), who released the following statements: 

"Critical access hospitals are vital to health care in our rural communities, and we must do everything we can to keep them strong. These hospitals allow Nebraskans to get health care in a familiar setting close to where they live and work. Unfortunately, too many rural hospitals are at risk and too many elected officials are ignoring this crisis. The Nebraska Hospital Association commends Congressman Smith for his leadership and taking action on this important issue,"  said Jeremy Nordquist President of NHA  . 

"The American Hospital Association (AHA) applauds Representatives Smith and Sewell for their leadership in promoting access to care in rural communities. This legislation would allow Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to serve patients needing critical medical services that may have lengths of stay greater than 96 hours. CAHs play an essential role treating patients and saving lives each and every day, and this legislation is long overdue for rural hospitals to be able to provide the types of services their communities need and seek close to home,"  said Lisa Kidder Hrobsky, AHA Senior Vice President, Legislative and Political Affairs  . 

BACKGROUND: 

Smith first introduced legislation to repeal the 96-hour rule in 2014. Since 2018, the rule has not been enforced because of stays initiated by the Trump administration and subsequent waivers.

10:52:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Congressman Adrian Smith (R-NE) spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives supporting passage of legislation (H.R. 33) to prevent the double taxation of Taiwanese residents and businesses engaging in business with Americans. 

Video of Smith's full remarks is linked  here  (link is external)  . Text is below: 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you Mr. Chairman, 

I rise today in support of the United States – Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act. 

The bill, as we’ve been hearing, would align the tax treatment of income earned in the U.S. by Taiwanese residents and businesses with that of any other foreign national from a country with whom the United States has a tax treaty, preventing the double taxation of Taiwanese residents and businesses engaging in business with Americans 

Taiwan, we know, is an important and strategic ally in the Indo-Pacific region, a democratic—I might add lowercase democratic—success story, but we know it’s the eighth-largest trading partner to our country. 

U.S. exports to Taiwan support hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and cumulative Taiwanese investment in the U.S. totals more than $137 billion. 

Taiwan also plays a critical role in our technology supply chains, as we’ve been hearing, and is certainly a key national security partner. 

Despite this, on the list of the 66 countries the U.S. currently has income tax treaties with—including China—Taiwan is conspicuously absent. 

Eliminating the undue double taxation of Taiwanese residents and businesses promotes economic efficiency and integration, strengthens our strategic partnership with Taiwan, and reinforces the long-term economic stability American businesses and our trusted allies need to invest for the future and combat the influence of bad actors. 

In the face of regular threats to its security and economic stability by a predatory adversary, Taiwan and its people have called on us to live up to our commitment as a strategic partner and friend to freedom loving nations. 

This is a good bill which delivers an overdue solution to an issue which has strong bipartisan support. I appreciate the discussions that we’ve been having here today. This strengthens ties that we have with a trusted ally as well. 

I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support the bill. 

Thank you, I yield back the balance of my time.

10:52:48 root         DEBUG    Titles: Smith, Edwards, Blackburn Introduce Bill to Protect Americans from Unfair Tax Preparation
10:52:48 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:52:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Congressman Adrian Smith (R-NE), Congressman Chuck Edwards (R-NC), and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced the Fostering Autonomy in Independent Returns by Prohibiting Redundant and Extralegal Programs (FAIR PREP) Act. The legislation builds upon a bill introduced by Smith and Edwards in 2024 to prohibit the IRS from continuing or developing a successor to its in-house Direct File pilot program. 

The members released the following statements: 

“Despite its supersized funding in the Democrats’ Inflation Act, the IRS has shown it is more focused on intruding on Americans’ financial privacy than helping them navigate our overly complex tax code,”  said Rep. Smith  . “Notwithstanding its poor record of customer service, the agency tasked with collecting federal revenue simply should not have the power to predetermine and dictate to hardworking Americans what they owe in taxes. This bill would protect Americans from further overreach and unnecessary audits while leaving existing free tax filing options intact. I thank Rep. Edwards, Sen. Blackburn, and my other colleagues for working with me to champion this legislative solution.” 

“By taking on the role of both tax preparer and tax auditor, the IRS created an undeniable conflict of interest when it circumvented Congress to establish the Direct File program,”  said Sen. Blackburn  . “This legislation would right this wrong by stopping the IRS from preparing tax returns without explicit legislative approval and ending this wasteful and misguided program.” 

“Without congressional approval, the Biden administration wasted millions of taxpayer dollars standing up the Direct File program, only for the program to have a less than 1 percent use rate last tax season,”  said Rep. Edwards  . “The IRS already offers a free tax filing program, called Free File, in partnership with private tax preparation companies. Instead of spending taxpayer dollars on a duplicative program, the IRS should be putting its resources toward better customer service and tax processing for the American people.” 

Cosponsors of the bill include: Reps. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Kevin Hern (R-OK), Mark Alford (R-MO), Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Steve Womack (R-AR), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), and Carol Miller (R-WV). 

Specifically, the FAIR PREP Act would: 

  * Amend Section 6020 of the Internal Revenue Code to explicitly prohibit the IRS from preparing tax returns in unauthorized instances, beginning 30 days after the bill’s enactment 
  * Name the Direct File program as an example of unlawful preparation; and 
  * Bar the Treasury Department and IRS from circumventing the rule by contracting with or awarding grants to third parties to operate such a program, unless explicitly authorized by Congress. 



Read text of the bill  here  . 

The legislation is supported by numerous stakeholder groups including Americans for Tax Reform, Heritage Action, National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, and Center for a Free Economy. 

“The IRS lied to Congress about Direct File and was slapped down by its own internal watch dog for using a bogus analysis. The IRS should not be the tax preparer, collector and auditor. This illegal power grab by the IRS must be stopped. This important bill from Sen. Blackburn and Rep. Smith would prohibit the IRS from creating a Direct File program without consent from Congress. I applaud them for their leadership and Americans for Tax Reform proudly supports this bill,”  said Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform 

“Government agencies like the IRS have routinely overstepped their authority and circumvented Congress to unconstitutionally push their own agendas. The IRS’s expensive tax filing program wastes taxpayer dollars by being unnecessary, unauthorized, and underutilized. The FAIR PREP Act puts the IRS in its place and returns to Congress its constitutional authority to authorize tax return preparation. Heritage Action supports this common sense legislation and urges members of Congress to hold government agencies accountable,”  said Ryan Walker, Executive Vice President, Heritage Action 

“National Taxpayers Union enthusiastically supports Senator Blackburn's FAIR PREP Act, which would terminate the IRS's unauthorized Direct File program. The IRS ought to be focused on improving customer service and modernizing its outdated technology instead of creating a duplicative tax prep service that could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year,”  said Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union 

“TPA enthusiastically applauds Senator Blackburn for introducing the FAIR PREP Act. From bypassing congressional approval to its lack of transparency over costs, the IRS has shown that it is willing to pursue the Direct File program without any oversight or accountability. This legislation would undo the mess of Direct File, protecting American taxpayers from IRS overreach and ensuring that the agency focuses exclusively on its mission of being the nation's tax collector. We urge all members to support this important effort,”  said Taxpayers Protection Alliance President David Williams 

“The tax collector cannot be the tax preparer without a conflict of interest. The IRS wants to collect the maximum amount possible from taxpayers. Tax preparation is supposed to represent the perspective of the taxpayer, who wants to pay only what is legally owed. Getting the IRS into the tax preparation business is like getting the rooster into the hen house business,”  said  Ryan Ellis, President of the Center for a Free Economy 

BACKGROUND: 

In January 2023, Reps. Adrian Smith and Michelle Steel's (R-CA) bill to repeal the Biden Administration’s $80 billion IRS expansion, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, became the  first bill passed  by the House in the 118th Congress. That bill would have also repealed the IRS’s controversial initial study of providing direct file services. 

In April 2024, Smith led his Ways and Means Committee colleagues in  writing  to the House Appropriations Committee asking them to defund the Direct File program for FY 2025. 

In June 2024, Smith led Ways and Means colleagues in  sending a letter  to Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Daniel Werfel raising concerns about IRS’ announced expansion of the Direct File program and asking Commissioner Werfel to respond to questions regarding statutory authority and the origin of funds allocated for development and advertisement of the program. 

Smith and Edwards introduced legislation in July 2024 to  terminate  the IRS’s unauthorized Direct File program. In December, Smith and Edwards  led a letter  asking President Trump to end the Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January.

10:52:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  —  Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02) issued the following statement regarding the recently announced agreement to pause the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of Israeli hostages: 

“I welcome the announcement of this agreement. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a barbaric attack, killing over 1,200 innocent people and seizing 251 hostages. The devastation that followed has claimed the lives of far too many innocent civilians, leaving countless families in heartbreak and grief. 

This agreement is a vital step toward ensuring the safe return of Israeli hostages. I am overjoyed for those families who will now be able to welcome home their loved ones. 

The ceasefire also provides a critical opportunity to ease the suffering of innocent civilians in Gaza and deliver much-needed humanitarian relief—something I have strongly supported since the start of this conflict.”

10:52:52 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:52:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  — Today, Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02), U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (PA), Rep. Dwight Evans (PA-03), Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (PA-05), and Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle L. Parker announced over $11 million in federal funding for the Philadelphia Community Charging Project Regional Partnership. 

The $11,092,498 Federal Highway Administration grant will fund the installation of up to 200 charging ports throughout the Philadelphia region, including suburban and rural areas. The project will focus on historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and will include community engagement, planning, design, installation, and workforce development. 

“Once again, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is continuing to deliver for Philadelphia,”  said Rep. Boyle.  “This law that I proudly voted for and championed has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild our infrastructure, make public transit more reliable, and create good-paying jobs. Thanks to this $11 million investment, we’ll be putting our neighbors to work building the infrastructure we need for zero-emission vehicles. These investments won’t just create jobs — they’ll make our commutes easier and ensure our children breathe cleaner air.” 

“I’m proud we helped secure this $11 million to make sure that clean, affordable transportation can reach more neighborhoods. This is leveling the playing field for every Philadelphian and puts communities that have been left out of the conversation at the forefront of this transition. This is what delivering for Pennsylvania really looks like,”  said Senator Fetterman. 

Rep. Evans said,  “This grant from the Biden-Harris administration will create jobs through workforce development as well as the work itself, and help us reduce air pollution and our dependence on foreign fuels. That’s a win-win for Philadelphia and our region!” 

"One of the challenges in transitioning to electric vehicles is ensuring that a robust, accessible network of public charging stations is available to everyone,"  said Rep. Scanlon.  "Thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this investment in that new charging network will make it easier for EV drivers across our region to charge their cars, reduce our carbon footprint, and support the American workers building these charging stations.” 

"This project will fill in existing gaps in our region's electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure network, with a focus on serving historically disadvantaged communities,"  said Mayor Cherelle L. Parker.  "We know that one of the largest barriers to EV adoption is access to charging infrastructure. By expanding access throughout the region, we can support an equitable EV transition that will uphold our City's climate goals as well as my vision for Safer, Cleaner, and Greener Philadelphia. Thank you to the U.S. DOT, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, U.S. Representative Dwight Evans, and all of our federal partners for their leadership. I would also like to recognize our regional partners and collaborators at the Philadelphia Parking Authority, Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, PECO, and PennDOT for their feedback and support."

10:52:54 root         DEBUG    Titles: Boyle at Ways and Means Hearing: Republican Policies Will Explode the Deficit, Raise Prices, and Betray the Middle Class
10:52:54 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:52:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – During a Ways and Means Committee hearing, Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02), a senior member of the committee and Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, exposed the harmful impact of permanently extending the Trump tax cuts and imposing new tariffs. 

Congressman Boyle highlighted that extending the Trump tax cuts would  add $4.6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade  . These tax cuts disproportionately benefit the ultra-wealthy and large corporations, while Republicans will use the resulting deficit as a pretext to cut essential programs for the American middle class. Boyle, joined by expert witness Brendan Duke from the Center for American Progress, also emphasized that Trump’s proposed tariffs would  raise prices for everyday Americans  , placing additional financial strain on the middle class. 

Questions as delivered and  video  (link is external)  are below: 

Congressman  Boyle  ’s Questioning: 

Rep.  Boyle  :  I do want to return to the history of eight years ago, because it's often said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. 

Eight years ago, the very top priority of then-President Trump and a unified Republican Congress was the so-called Tax Cuts and Job Act, which, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed, 83 percent of the benefit went to the richest 1 percent. No wonder that in the entire history of Gallup polling, the only poll to register majority voter disapproval, as opposed to approval, was the TCJA. 

And it wasn't just one poll. Poll after poll showed only about 40 percent of the American people supported the Trump tax cuts, while a majority, somewhere in the mid 50 percent range, opposed them. The wisdom of the American people was proven to be right. That added $2 trillion to our national debt. So now that it's 8 years later and they're set to expire, the question is, how much more debt would this policy add? 

The CBO again released a report in May, and they've testified, before the Budget Committee, another committee on which I serve as Ranking Member. They showed in their report the full extension of the TCJA would add $4.6 trillion to the national debt. So for the last four years I keep hearing from a number of my friends on the other side of the aisle how concerned they are about deficit, how concerned they are about debt. 

I do tend to notice that whenever there's about to be a Republican in the White House, we tend to hear a lot less concern about deficit and debt. And the top priority is always tax cuts for the richest 1 percent of Americans. Now, Mr. Duke, with a great first name, let me turn to you, Brendan, and ask you, do tax cuts pay for themselves? 

Brendan Duke:  No. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  And, the $4. 6 trillion figure that the nonpartisan professionals at the CBO found, which is also similar to analysis done by the Wharton School and by other nonpartisan groups as well, does that sound approximately the right number? 

Brendan Duke:  Yup. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  And you are familiar with some of the other reports and analysis that has been done by other groups. They're all approximately in that 4 and a half trillion range, correct? 

Brendan Duke:  Yeah, that's right. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  So it is fair to say that if we fully extend the TCJA, we will be adding at least four trillion dollars more to the national debt. 

Brendan Duke:  That's right. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  Now let me turn, to tariffs. Tariff is another word for tax, is it not? 

Brendan Duke:  That's right. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  So if President Trump follows through on his promise to do wholesale tariffs on imported goods, that would be, in reality, like a national sales tax on anything that we get abroad, correct? 

Brendan Duke:  That's right. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  It's funny, it seems to me that one of the big drivers of this past election was dealing with the global increase in inflation, a problem that wreaked havoc all around the world, from the Baltics and Germany, through the UK, to Canada, the US, Asia, started in 2021 once economies began to get back into full swing after the COVID pandemic and that we had to restart supply chains. Would tariffs make goods less expensive for the American people? 

Brendan Duke:  Absolutely not. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  In fact, tariffs would make goods more expensive for the American people. 

Brendan Duke:  That's right. 

Rep.  Boyle  :  Thank you. With that, I yield back.

10:52:55 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:52:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – With President Joe Biden entering his final week in office, Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02) renewed his call for the President to issue preemptive blanket pardons for individuals named on Donald Trump and Kash Patel’s so-called “enemies list.” Boyle initially called for  these pardons  on December 4, 2024. 

“Donald Trump and Kash Patel have made their intentions unmistakably clear. Patel’s so-called ‘enemies list,’ brazenly published in his own book, is a blueprint for political retribution against those who stood firm in defense of our democracy and the rule of law. This is no hypothetical threat—it’s a dangerous roadmap for the abuse of power. 

That’s why I’m once again calling on President Biden, in the final days of his presidency, to issue a blanket pardon for those targeted by Patel’s list. The list includes law enforcement officers, military leaders, and dedicated public servants who have worked tirelessly to protect our nation and its democratic institutions. 

Time and again, Trump has demonstrated his willingness to shatter norms and traditions to serve his own ends and punish his opponents. We need bold and decisive action to protect these public servants and uphold the integrity of our justice system. Failure to act risks allowing a culture of retribution to take root, threatening the core values of our democracy.”

10:52:59 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:52:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, D.C., January 16, 2025) — Congresswoman Nancy Mace’s Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act has passed the House, marking a major victory in the fight to keep dangerous illegal aliens with violent records out of the United States. 

"No family should endure the heartbreak the families of Laken Riley, Mollie Tibbetts, Karina Vetrano, and Maddie Hines have experienced. Every woman and every girl deserves to feel safe in their own community,”  said Rep. Nancy Mace.  “The radical left doesn’t agree with this. 145 liberals in Congress love illegal immigrant rapists and murders.. House Republicans united to expand protections for women and put the safety of Americans first.” 

Under the newly passed legislation: 

  * Aliens convicted of sex offenses or domestic violence—or those who admit to such crimes—will be deemed inadmissible to the United States. 
  * Any alien convicted of a sex offense or conspiracy to commit such an offense will face deportation. 



“This isn’t complicated—keeping criminal illegal aliens out of our country and off our streets is just common sense,”  Mace continued.  “Women should be able to walk down the street without fear, and families should feel safe in their own neighborhoods.” 

"I am proud to co-sponsor the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, and I applaud Congresswoman Mace for spearheading this effort. We have witnessed far too many instances of illegal aliens committing heinous sexual offenses, a direct consequence of President Biden's open border policies. It is time to put an end to this, protect American women, and secure our border." 

– Rep. Tony Wied (WI-08) 

“It’s unconscionable to allow illegal alien rapists and sex offenders to dwell among our daughters, wives, and sisters. The women in our lives deserve better than this. That’s why I’m excited to cosponsor Congresswoman Mace’s bill, which ensures that no alien convicted of sex offenses or domestic violence can enter our homeland, and that alien rapists and sex offenders are quickly deported.” 

– Rep. Brandon Gill (TX-26) 

“Between Laken Riley, Rachel Morin and Jocelyn Nungaray, one too many American women have lost their lives at the hands of violent illegal aliens. I am proud to once again cosponsor Rep. Mace’s Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act to protect women and girls from violent crimes committed by migrants and ensure those who commit these horrific acts are held accountable and never allowed to seek citizenship in the United States.” 

– Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11) 

“Over the last four years, we have seen countless innocent women’s lives taken due to our nation’s misguided priorities. Illegal aliens have been wrongfully granted an all-access pass through our borders, resulting in horrific consequences for American families. I am heartened, however, by the introduction of this vital legislation, which offers a crucial step toward restoring our commitment to safeguarding the lives and well-being of our citizens.” 

– Rep. Mike Kennedy (UT-03) 

"H.R. 30, the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, closes dangerous loopholes in our immigration laws, prioritizes the safety of American communities, and reaffirms that we will not tolerate criminal behavior from anyone, especially those who exploit our broken immigration system." 

– Rep. Lance Gooden (TX-05) 

“Let me be VERY CLEAR: no illegal immigrant with a history of violent crimes should be allowed to enter our country. Period. Republicans were elected to make our country safer, and especially to protect women from these criminals. I am happy to cosponsor Rep. Mace’s legislation and I look forward to it passing the House swiftly so it can move through the Senate and be signed into law as soon as possible.” 

– Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05) 

“I am proud to support H.R. 30, The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act. This common-sense legislation closes loopholes in standing immigration laws to prioritize identifying and deporting illegal immigrants with sexual violence charges. Our nation is not a haven for the world’s bad actors. House Republicans are committed to making America safe again.” 

– Rep. Tony Gonzales (TX-23) 

“For far too long, illegal immigrants have taken advantage of our open borders, threatening the safety of our communities. We have seen the tragic loss of life at the hands of criminal illegal immigrants who have been convicted or who have committed sex offenses or domestic violence. Enough is enough. Today, House Republicans reaffirmed our commitment to fight violence against women and to secure our nation from the chaos that has been occurring at our southern border.” 

– Rep. Laurel Lee (FL-15) 

“President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed border policies have invited criminal illegal aliens from all over the world to invade our country. As of July 21, 2024, over 662,000 noncitizens with criminal histories were on ICE’s national non-detained docket. This is unacceptable. I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of Congresswoman Mace’s bill to ensure illegal aliens who are convicted of, who admit having committed, or who admit committing sex offenses or domestic violence are inadmissible and deportable. We must do everything we can to protect our nation’s women and children.” 

– Rep. Troy Nehls (TX-22) 

“The Biden administration has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to protect our communities from criminals illegally in our country. Any illegal alien who has committed a sexual offense or domestic violence should not be allowed into the country or released into the United States.” 

– Rep. Joe Wilson (SC-02) 

“Our Republican Congress is acting quickly and decisively to end the Biden border crisis. As Kansas Attorney General, I saw far too many cases of illegal aliens committing heinous, violent crimes against American citizens, particularly women and children. By ensuring that noncitizens who commit these crimes are both inadmissible to and removed from the United States, this legislation will make communities in Kansas and across our great nation safer. I’m proud to be a cosponsor and look forward to this bill being signed into law by President Trump.” 

– Rep. Derek Schmidt (KS-02) 

"The fact that we even need to talk about the need to protect women and children from illegal aliens shows you how far off course the left’s radical agenda has gotten us. The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act is common-sense, puts American Women First, and I’m proud to co-sponsor.” 

– Rep. Addison McDowell (NC-06) 

“One thing’s for sure under President Biden's open border policies: women and girls aren’t safe. There are far too many cases of illegal aliens attacking women for Congress to sit on its hands. We are mandated to secure the southern border and keep Americans safe. The time for action is now." 

– Rep. Scott Perry (PA-10) 

“Illegal aliens who commit sex offenses or domestic violence should face immediate deportation – no exceptions. With Republican leadership in the House, Senate, and White House, I look forward to ensuring these abusers are removed from our country.” 

– Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07) 

“As a cosponsor of the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, I am committed to protecting all Americans, especially women, by holding violent illegal immigrants accountable for their actions. This bill guarantees that those who enter our country illegally and commit crimes like domestic violence and sexual assault will face instant deportation. We are sending a clear message: predators have no safe haven here.” 

– Rep. Gabe Evans (CO-08) 

“The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act is an essential step in protecting women and creating a moral standard in our immigration system. The last thing America needs is more criminal illegal aliens within our borders, especially those with a record of harming mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters. Individuals who commit this type of reckless violence should never be welcomed in our country.” 

– Rep. Brian Babin, D.D.S (TX-36) 

“Securing our borders is both a matter of national security and a matter of protecting those closest to us, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and indeed all Americans. Foreign nationals who commit domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment have no place in our nation, and I am proud to support a bill that gives law enforcement the tools they need to make our nation safer. This bill sends a clear message that foreign nationals who choose to commit violence in our nation are not welcome in our nation.” 

– Rep. Nicholas Begich (AK- At Large) 

“Illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds – especially those who have committed sexual assault – should be immediately deported. I cosponsored the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act to make it clear that any violent illegal alien Biden let into our country should be at the top of the deportation list. This is just commonsense. Any Democrat who votes against this bill should be asked why they think illegal immigrants who have committed sexual assault should be allowed to stay in the U.S.” 

– Rep. Ashley Hinson (IA-02) 

This bill passed 274-145.

10:53:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:53:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. -  Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and U.S. Representatives Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA-11), Kweisi Mfume (D-MD-07), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-01), and Don Bacon (R-NE-02) reintroduced the  Saving the Civil Service Act  .  The  bipartisan legislation would  protect the federal workforce from politicization and political manipulation. 

“Every day, our nation’s federal employees go to work for the American people to administer Social Security, Medicare, and veterans’ benefits, protect our national security, and provide other critical services to communities across our country,”  said Kaine.  “We must ensure our federal workers continue to be hired based on their expertise and experience, not their political party. I’m concerned by the President-elect’s proposed plans to target the federal workforce, and I will keep working with my colleagues to pass this legislation to protect the merit-based federal civil service system.” 

“The civil servants who make up our federal workforce are the engine that keeps our federal government running,”  said Connolly.  “They are our country’s greatest asset. We rely on their experience and expertise to provide every basic government service—from delivering the mail to helping families in the wake of natural disasters. The President-elect’s promise to remove qualified experts and replace them with political loyalists is a direct threat to our national security and our government’s ability to function the way the American people expect it to. It threatens to create a system wherein benefits and services are delivered based on the politics, not the needs, of the recipient. Expertise, not political fealty, must define our civil service.” 

On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted service. This executive order would undermine the merit system principles of our federal workforce by requiring agency heads to reclassify “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that removes their due process rights and civil service protections. 

The  Saving the Civil Service Act  would ensure the civil service system cannot be politically manipulated by: 

  * Preventing any position in the federal competitive service created after September 30, 2020, from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. 


  * Installing a cap on the number of conversions to the frozen excepted service schedule (Schedule C). The cap cannot exceed more than 1% of the total number of employees at such agency as of the first day of such term, or five employees, whichever is greater. 


  * Requiring that anyone who is converted provide consent for that conversion, and a report to Congress on any conversions. 



The  Saving the Civil Service Act  is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Angus King (I-ME), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Brian Schatz (D-HI), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), John Fetterman (D-PA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD). 

The Saving the Civil Service Act is endorsed by the following organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the Federal Managers Association (FMA), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).

10:53:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, released the following statement after a hostage return and ceasefire deal was reached to end the war between Israel and Hamas, pausing the conflict which started after Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack in Israel on October 7, 2023: 

“I’m grateful for the Biden Administration’s tireless efforts to negotiate a deal—which I have long called for—to reunite hostage families and flood Gaza with desperately-needed humanitarian assistance. This agreement marks an important step toward a lasting peace. It is in the best interest of hostage families, the Israeli and Palestinian people, and U.S. civilians and military personnel throughout the region that we continue to build on this progress. That will mean additional steps to prevent further regional escalation by Houthis, Hezbollah, and other proxy actors, provide all Palestinians with the opportunity to go back home in Gaza and the West Bank, and chart a path that leads to what was promised to Israelis and Palestinians more than 75 years ago: two states living peacefully as neighbors.” 

Kaine has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. He strongly supports Israel’s right to defend itself and  condemned  Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack. He has also pushed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza, called for an end to violence against innocent civilians, and has been a leading voice in Congress in urging that U.S. weapons transfers to Israel be comprised primarily of  defensive weapons  .

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) spoke on the Senate floor in opposition to President-elect Trump and Republicans’ proposals to cut taxes for billionaires and impose broad-based universal tariffs, which would raise costs for American families. Trump and Republicans in Congress are currently negotiating an extension to Trump’s 2017 tax law, which cut taxes for large corporations and the highest-income earners and  substantially increased the federal deficit  . 

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that extending the law without any changes will add $4.6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Other tax experts’ estimates have shown that Trump’s tariffs could raise costs by  $2,500  to  nearly $4,000  per household and American consumers could lose between  $46 billion to $78 billion  in spending power each year. 

“Taxes should be fair, they should be consistent, they should be predictable, and they should generate the revenue that America needs to fund Social Security, Medicare, education, roads, national security, and the other critical investments that matter to our constituents,”  said Kaine. 

But, Kaine said of the  2017 tax law  , which he opposed,  “Our Republican colleagues plummeted and slashed the corporate tax rate not to 28%, not to 25%, but to 21%—and didn’t even pay for it… just racked up higher deficits… The bill also left out our nation’s poorest children. Nearly 20 million children were left out of the full value of the child tax credit because it was not made refundable.” 

“On top of these inequities that the bill was too heavily weighted toward corporations, too light toward individuals—and with individuals, too heavily weighted toward the wealthy rather than lower- and middle-income people—the Republican bill in 2017 did another thing that was entirely, entirely unjustified. The bill made the corporate tax cuts permanent and the individual tax cuts temporary,”  Kaine continued.  “And that brings us to today: Republicans debating how to ram another $4.6 trillion in tax cuts through the Senate.” 

Kaine then spoke about how Trump’s tariff plans would further hurt working class Americans, saying:  “If President Trump moves forward with broad-based, universal tariffs—and they’re not defeated in this body—American families will suffer. American families will pay the cost. We know it because we’ve seen it before. Study after study showed that American consumers bore the brunt of Trump’s first trade war, and this time it will be even more.” 

“I urge my colleagues … don’t go down that path again. Work with us to find a tax bill that will appropriately prioritize the needs of everyday American citizens and small businesses,”  Kaine concluded.

10:53:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement on the nomination of Marco Rubio as Secretary of State: 

“Marco Rubio and I have served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee together since I came to the Senate in 2013. While we do not agree on everything, I’m proud to support his nomination, and I believe he will make an excellent Secretary of State. He is smart, has significant foreign policy experience, and has a track record of working across the aisle to advance our national security objectives. He has also become a trusted partner to me on issues such as bolstering U.S. leadership in NATO and engaging effectively in the Western Hemisphere. I’m particularly optimistic that Marco will prioritize constructive engagement in the Americas—a region essential to U.S. economic and national security that previous Administrations of both parties have severely neglected. I urge the Senate to move swiftly to confirm him.” 

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a  nomination hearing  for Rubio on January 15. 

During their time in the Senate, Kaine and Rubio have worked on numerous pieces of legislation, including bills to  prevent any U.S. President from leaving NATO  ,  counter oppression in Nicaragua  ,  reunite separated Korean American families  ,  support North Korean human rights  ,  modernize the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Bureau  , and  strengthen security in the Caribbean  .

10:53:13 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:53:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $19,886,658  in federal funding for the University of Virginia’s College at Wise in conjunction with the University of Virginia and key partners in the region to enhance resilient infrastructure and help lower energy costs for communities in Southwest Virginia. This funding was awarded through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program, which was created by the  Inflation Reduction Act  that both senators cast a deciding vote for. 

“Resiliency and energy efficiency are crucial ways to make our communities more safe while also lowering costs,”  the senators said  . “We’re glad this funding, which was made possible by the  Inflation Reduction Act  , will help advance those goals in Southwest Virginia and address important community needs.” 

This funding will implement Climate Resilience Planning in 10 communities throughout Southwest Virginia and fund resilient affordable housing, electric vehicle charging stations, energy-efficient and carbon-neutral child care and workforce training, and resilient gathering spaces that double as community capacity building spaces and health care access points. The projects receiving this funding are expected to mitigate over 40,000 metric tons of CO2 in the next 25 years and save child care centers over $50,000 in energy costs, allowing more funding to be directed toward child care worker salaries. 

$13,305,591 of the $19,886,658 announced today will be allocated as follows: 

  * $4,594,245  for  United Way  of Southwest Virginia  to improve energy efficiency at care centers, including through solar installation and upgrades to child care facilities, outdoor classrooms, and other initiatives. 
  * $1,757,708  for  Dickenson County  to build a resilience hub in the Town of Haysi outside of the floodplain. This project includes engineering and architectural design and permits, construction of the facility, and the installation of an EV fast charger. 
  * $4,847,841  for  Buchanan County  to build housing in Southern Gap outside of the floodplain. This project includes construction of water, sewer, power and telecommunications infrastructure; interior roadways and walkways; two single family dwelling units; multi-family town house rental units; and an EV charging station at the Regional Office Park Office Building. 
  * $132,000  for  Virginia Tech  for a community engagement project on resilience strategic planning. This community-based resilience planning process involves the University of Virginia’s  Resilience Adaptation Feasibility Tool (RAFT)  , which helps climate planners and localities pinpoint and evaluate environmental risks, including drought, flooding, and extreme weather, in different communities. 
  * $1,973,797  for  James Madison University  to advance energy career development. 



Warner and Kaine have long supported efforts to expand and promote energy infrastructure throughout the Commonwealth. Earlier this week, Warner and Kaine  announced over $10 million  in federal funding for electric vehicle charging ports in Virginia. In 2024, the senators announced over  $156 million in federal funding  for Virginia’s solar energy development, helping lower energy costs. Through the  Inflation Reduction Act  , Virginia has received  over $1 billion in investments  for clean energy manufacturing projects, including  $208 million for Mack and Volvo Trucks  in Dublin. The senators have also advocated for and  secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding  for initiatives that reduce utility costs for Virginians, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

10:53:13 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:53:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Angus I. King (I-ME), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Peter Welch (D-VT) unveiled an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  to improve the ability of the legislation to protect our communities. 

This amendment would ensure that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers can use their limited time and detention facilities to detain truly dangerous individuals who pose an immediate risk to the public. The senators’ amendment would help improve the  Laken Riley Act  by ensuring that only those undocumented individuals who are found guilty of a crime—or have been charged with, or arrested for, a crime and failed to appear for court appointments—will be detained under this bill. 

“My thoughts are with Laken Riley’s family in the wake of her horrific murder. Americans have a right to be safe in their communities and—for many reasons—deserve commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system,”  said Kaine  . “But in its current form, I have serious concerns that the  Laken Riley Act  —which did not receive a single hearing or vote from its committee of jurisdiction in the Senate—will burden our law enforcement officers in a way that will make it impossible to get truly dangerous individuals off the street and ultimately make Virginians less safe. I’m glad to have worked with my colleagues on this amendment to try to fix that, and urge Senate leadership to put it up for a vote.” 

“The murder of Laken Riley was horrific, and my prayers are with her family and loved ones. I have always been supportive of immigration policies that are tough, fair, and keep Americans safe. It's why I voted for the bipartisan border security agreement last year,”  said Luján  . “But this legislation as it stands would divert resources from serious threats, risk abuse by the incoming administration, endanger DACA holders, and cost American taxpayers billions. That’s why I’m joining my colleagues to introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill, and I urge Senate leadership to consider it for a vote.” 

“Mandatory lockup of adults who are convicted of a crime and pose a threat to the community or a flight risk makes a lot of sense. But mandatory lockups of children accused of minor offenses? Permanent imprisonment of kids accused of stealing lollipops? This is twisted. And super damaging to the children. The Kaine amendment strikes the right balance for community safety,”  said Merkley. 

“Laken Riley’s tragic murder should never have occurred, and while our thoughts continue to be with her loved ones, the Laken Riley Act is a bipartisan attempt to help prevent future tragedies. For too long, Congress has failed to address our broken immigration system and border security. I was deeply disappointed when last year’s bipartisan border security agreement failed because it would have increased protections at the border and stemmed the flow of fentanyl into the United States. That’s why I voted to proceed with consideration of the Laken Riley Act and why I’m proud to help introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill. Our amendment would improve our enforcement mechanisms to better ensure we can keep offenders off the streets and strengthen public safety,”  said Shaheen  . 

“We must keep our communities safe and prioritize the detention of violent offenders. I support Senator Kaine’s amendment because it directly addresses the circumstances that led to the terrible murder of Laken Riley, without creating a system that diverts resources away from the detention of violent offenders. If Republicans are serious about working with us to improve public safety, they will help ensure this amendment – which would improve the bill significantly – is considered and passed,”  said Van Hollen. 

“Laken Riley should be here today, and my heart goes out to her family and loved ones. It’s clear that we need to take steps to reform our broken immigration system — and that includes enforcement,”  said Warner.  “I’m proud to introduce this amendment to help strengthen public safety and improve the Laken Riley Act to make sure we dedicate our resources to getting dangerous individuals off our streets.” 

“Laken Riley’s murder was heartbreaking, and my thoughts go out to her family and loved ones. Democrats believe we need serious reform on immigration, and that includes enforcement. But this bill has significant problems, and that’s why we’re partnering together to bring commonsense, pragmatic changes through the amendment process. This bill, in its current form, includes no requirement that a person be convicted of a property offense before they are held indefinitely, which diminishes due process. It grants unprecedented power to state attorneys general to control our immigration system and threatens to overwhelm our federal courts. And it also puts children in danger of mandatory detention,”  said Welch.  “I believe our amendment to fix the issues outlined is fair and strengthens the  Laken Riley Act  . It should earn quick bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues in Senate Leadership to bring it up for a vote on the Senate floor.”

10:53:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. —  U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro (D-TX-20), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement on the Biden Administration’s decision to rescind the State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation for Cuba: 

“We applaud the Biden Administration’s decision to rescind the State Sponsor of Terrorism designation for Cuba. President Trump’s politically motivated decision to designate Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in the final days of his first term undermined years of progress toward improving U.S. engagement with the Cuban people. Over the last four years, that designation has exacerbated Cuba’s isolation from the outside world and restricted opportunities for private enterprise that could bring freedom and opportunity to the Cuban people. 

“The United States must continue to hold Cuba accountable for serious and sustained human rights abuses, including the mass imprisonment of political prisoners. We appreciate the Catholic Church’s efforts to negotiate on behalf of these prisoners and welcome the Cuban government's announcement of the release of 553 people imprisoned for their political views and activism. 

“President Obama described U.S. policy toward Cuba as the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas. 35 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is time for a new approach in the Western Hemisphere.”

10:53:15 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner & Kaine Urge Biden Administration to Extend TPS for All Eligible Countries
10:53:15 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:53:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) have urged the Biden administration to immediately re-designate or extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to the maximum extent allowable under the law for all eligible countries. The senators commended President Biden’s  recent action  to extend status for El Salvador, Venezuela, Sudan, and Ukraine, while stressing the need to extend these benefits to all remaining eligible TPS countries as the current administration winds down. 

TPS provides protection to foreign nationals in the United States whose home countries are experiencing temporary and extraordinary conditions, including armed conflict, natural disasters, and other extraordinary conditions that render return unsafe. Currently, 17 countries have TPS designations, and as of September 30, 2024 nearly 1.1 million foreign nationals were protected by TPS, living in all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. 

In the Commonwealth, 28,225 people are living under TPS: 545 individuals from Afghanistan, 95 from Burma, 95 from Cameroon, 15,485 from El Salvador, 445 from Ethiopia, 1,340 from Haiti, 2,720 from Honduras, 325 from Nepal, 60 from Nicaragua, 20 from Somalia, 25 from South Sudan, 165 from Sudan, 170 from Syria, 895 from Ukraine, 5,700 from Venezuela, and 135 individuals from Yemen. 

Highlighting the importance of the TPS program in communities across the country, the senators wrote,  “Many of these individuals with TPS have lived in the U.S. for decades, calling this country their home. They are contributing members of our society, including our colleagues and neighbors. The TPS program provides them a way to support themselves, contribute to the U.S. workforce and economy, and keep their families together.” 

With President-elect Trump taking office in one week, the fate of this program is uncertain. Both he and Vice President-elect Vance have  signaled  that significant immigration policy changes could include eliminating the TPS program all together. As a result, Sens. Warner and Kaine are stressing the urgency of this request. 

“Unfortunately, TPS beneficiaries are at risk of losing their legal status and could face removal proceedings to countries that have been deemed unsafe to return to and where their lives would be at grave risk,”  they continued.  “The incoming administration has vowed to terminate the TPS program, just as they attempted to during their first term. Within the first six months of this incoming term, six TPS designations, covering over 76,000 beneficiaries, are set to expire.” 

Sens. Warner and Kaine have long-championed TPS for vulnerable migrants from countries including Haiti, Ukraine, Cameroon,  Sudan  , El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Last year, the senators  urged the Biden administration to extend TPS  for Haitians amid spiking violence. In December 2023, the senators  praised  a decision by the Department of Homeland Security to grant existing TPS recipients additional time to re-register for the program. 

A copy of the letter is available  here  and text is below: 

Dear President Biden, 

We thank you for your commitment to expanding Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and commend your most recent announcements to extend TPS for foreign nationals from El Salvador, Venezuela, Sudan, and Ukraine. We write to urgently request that your administration build on your recent TPS actions and issue a re-designation or extension of status, to the maximum extent possible under the law, for all TPS-eligible countries. 

Through the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has the discretion to issue a Temporary Protected Status designation and provide for temporary relief from removal and work authorization to certain foreign nationals from countries under specific circumstances, including armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return. 

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1,095,115 foreign nationals residing in all 50 states, including D.C. and U.S. territories, were protected by TPS. This includes nearly 30,000 TPS recipients in Virginia. 

Many of these individuals with TPS have lived in the U.S. for decades, calling this country their home. They are contributing members of our society, including our colleagues and neighbors. The TPS program provides them a way to support themselves, contribute to the U.S. workforce and economy, and keep their families together. 

Unfortunately, TPS beneficiaries are at risk of losing their legal status and could face removal proceedings to countries that have been deemed unsafe to return to and where their lives would be at grave risk. The incoming administration has vowed to terminate the TPS program, just as they attempted to during their first term. Within the first six months of this incoming term, six TPS designations, covering over 76,000 beneficiaries, are set to expire. 

As such, we strongly urge your administration to re-designate or extend TPS for countries with existing designations. These actions will provide much needed clarity for current TPS holders and prevent harmful deportations to countries designated as unsafe. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely,

10:53:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $3.9 million  in federal funding from the  American Rescue Plan  for the Community College Workforce Alliance in  Disputanta  to expand regional workforce training programs to support the Richmond-Petersburg Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (APM) cluster and help Virginians get the skills they need for jobs in the advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotechnology industries. The APM cluster, which is led by the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority, manufactures critical drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The funding was allocated through the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s (EDA)  Good Jobs Challenge  . 

“The Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster has seen tremendous growth in recent years, and I am thrilled by the innovation that has taken place,”  said Warner.  “This funding, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan, for the Community College Workforce Alliance will continue to build on these efforts, ensuring that we have a capable, ready workforce to step into the good-paying, skilled jobs created in the Petersburg region.” 

“As a city councilman, mayor, governor, and senator, I’ve been proud of what we’ve done to grow the Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster and onshore the manufacturing of essential medicines and their ingredients. I’m thrilled the Community College Workforce Alliance in Disputanta is receiving federal funding from the American Rescue Plan we passed to help further the cluster’s innovative efforts and ensure we have the workforce needed to fill these critical roles,”  said Kaine.  “I will continue working to support the APM cluster and help Virginians access good-paying manufacturing jobs in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotechnology.” 

Warner and Kaine have long supported the APM cluster in Richmond/Petersburg and have supported policies to strengthen domestic manufacturing of critical medicines. In 2023, the APM cluster was designated as a Tech Hub under the  CHIPS and Science Act  for its innovative work in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing. The senators also worked to secure  $52.9 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan  for the cluster. In August 2024, Kaine  toured  Phlow Corp., a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in the Virginia APM cluster, which produces critical medicines and boosts the national supply chain. In April 2022, Kaine  visited  the cluster to learn more about its efforts to streamline prescription drug manufacturing. Kaine helped form and grow the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority while he was on Richmond City Council, served on the Authority’s board as Mayor of Richmond, and appointed its board members as Governor of Virginia.

10:53:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine announced  $12,352,167  in federal funding for improvements for airports throughout the Commonwealth. This funding was awarded through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA)  Airport Infrastructure Grants  (AIG) program, which was created by the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  that both senators helped pass. 

“Virginia’s airports are crucial for advancing our economy and connecting us to the rest of the country and the world,”  the senators said  . “We’re glad this funding, which was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help make needed upgrades and expansions possible for airports throughout the Commonwealth. We will continue working to bolster Virginia’s infrastructure and economic growth.” 

The funding is broken down as follows: 

  * $341,477  for the  Town of Leesburg  to construct a new 20,000-square-yard apron at the north end of the airfield to increase aircraft parking capacity at the Leesburg Executive Airport. 
  * $430,000  for the  Town of Leesburg  to  construct a new sponsor-owned federal contract tower and acquire and install eligible equipment.  Warner and Kaine, alongside then-Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton (D-VA-10), strongly backed  Leesburg in its negotiations with the FAA over costs to operate a remote tower until this new brick-and-mortar tower is completed. 
  * $9,662,240  for the  Norfolk Airport Authority  to acquire and install three new passenger boarding bridges to accommodate more aircraft operations, expand Terminal Concourse A by 25,000 square feet and three gates, reconstruct 50,000 square feet of existing Terminal Concourse A, create new restrooms, and other upgrades. 
  * $1,055,800  for the  Virginia Highlands Airport Commission  to construct a new 12,915 square foot and a new 3,600 square foot sponsor-owned hangar for aircraft storage, which will boost revenue and improve the airport’s financial self-sufficiency. 
  * $862,650  for the  Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport Commission  to construct a new 12,500 square yard apron to accommodate more aircraft operations, construct two new 12,000 square foot sponsor-owned hangars for aircraft, which will boost revenue and improve the airport’s financial self-sufficiency, and expand an existing commercial apron by an additional 1,800 square yards to accommodate more passengers and more aircraft operations. 



Warner and Kaine have long supported efforts to improve Virginia’s airports. Warner and Kaine have secured  millions in federal funding  for airports across Virginia through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . In October 2024, they  announced nearly $57 million  in federal funding to revitalize Virginia airports. In September 2024, they  announced more than $46 million  in federal funding for improvements to Virginia airports through the Airport Improvement Program. The senators have previously  announced $104.6 million  in combined federal funding for the new terminal building at Dulles.

10:53:17 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $10,797,461  in federal funding for the  Virginia Department of Energy  to build 392 electric vehicle (EV) charging ports  at urban and rural tourism destinations across Virginia. Over half of the 392 chargers will be installed in disadvantaged communities across the Commonwealth to increase EV accessibility for all Virginians. The grant is allocated through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, which was made possible by the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  , which both senators helped pass. 

“Electric vehicles will help create healthier communities for future generations by reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. However, it’s critical that Virginians who choose to purchase EVs have access to charging stations so they can get where they need to go,”  said the senators.  “We’re glad the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we helped pass is bringing this funding to Virginia to install EV charging ports across the Commonwealth, especially in areas that receive a high volume of visitors.” 

Warner and Kaine have long supported Virginia’s clean energy economy. Both senators were key votes in the passage of the  Inflation Reduction Act  , legislation that included tax credits for individuals who purchase electric vehicles and funding to expand access to EV technology. In 2022, Warner and Kaine announced  almost $16 million  in  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  funding was delivered to install EV charging ports.

10:53:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) held a press conference announcing their letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to trigger the 90-day extension in the  Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act  to allow ByteDance additional time to divest from TikTok before facing a ban in the United States. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) also signed the letter. 

In the letter the Senators write  , “Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok. A shutdown would be especially painful for creators in California who have been using the platform to share their stories and find resources during the tragic wildfires around Los Angeles. With Senate Republicans blocking legislation introduced this week to extend the TikTok divest-or-ban deadline and the Supreme Court, by all accounts, appearing unlikely to come to TikTok’s aid, your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday.” 

On January 15, 2025, Senators Booker, Markey, and Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Congressman Khanna (D-CA-17) introduced the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  , legislation that would delay the January 19 deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban, by an additional 270 days.

10:53:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement: 

“I am grateful that a ceasefire deal was announced to finally release dozens of hostages kidnapped over 15 months ago by Hamas and increase the flow of desperately needed humanitarian resources to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This agreement is a necessary diplomatic breakthrough, and I thank President Biden and his administration, as well as officials from Qatar and Egypt, for the invaluable role they played in this process. I also appreciate President-elect Trump’s team for their efforts to help facilitate this deal. I urge both sides to take their respective steps to swiftly implement the agreed upon terms of the deal and to continue negotiations so that all hostages–including American citizens–are reunited with their families, a lasting ceasefire is achieved, and the work to rebuild a Gaza free from Hamas’s terror begins. 

“I am hopeful that adherence to this agreement can be the next step towards building a just and lasting peace, with Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in mutual peace, security, dignity, and recognition. The work must continue to achieve a two-state solution that affirms and protects Israel’s right to exist as a democratic Jewish state and ensures the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and a state of their own.”

10:53:20 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:53:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA-17) announced the introduction of the  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  , legislation that would delay the January 19 deadline by which ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban, by an additional 270 days. 

“Tens of millions of Americans use TikTok for entertainment, business, and social networking, including myself,”  said Senator Booker  . “Americans should not be shut off from freely expressing themselves on the platforms they choose. I do believe that ByteDance should divest from TikTok, but it should be given sufficient time to carry out a sale. That’s why I’m partnering with Senators Markey and Wyden on this legislation that would extend the deadline.” 

“The TikTok ban was rushed through without sufficient consideration of the profound consequences it would have on the 170 million Americans who use the platform,”  said Senator Markey  . “Today, TikTok is a space where users share critical resources during emergencies such as the Los Angeles wildfires, earn money to cover groceries and medical care, and build community in challenging times. The  Extend the TikTok Deadline Act  is a straightforward, one-sentence bill designed to give Congress the time needed to fully assess the implications of this ban. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly on this legislation.” 

“The rushed divestment of Tiktok is a huge giveaway to Donald Trump and his cronies, who are poised to scoop up a massive social media company and turn it into another partisan mouthpiece. I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to protecting American's personal data from China -- I've written three of the strongest bills on offer to protect sensitive U.S. data. Extending the deadline to sell TikTok will allow Congress to consider better ways to mitigate threats from China, courts to review the law, and additional bidders to make proposals to acquire TikTok with more time for public scrutiny,”  said Senator Wyden. 

“A ban on TikTok violates the free speech of 170 million Americans and hurts the livelihoods of creators and small business owners who use the app,”  said Representative Khanna.  “We need laws to protect Americans’ data, but banning TikTok is not the answer. I’m proud to join Senator Markey in introducing this legislation to pause the TikTok ban for 270 days.” 

Last year, the TikTok sell-or-ban legislation was forced into a larger bill to provide vital humanitarian aid, fight global starvation, and fund other key priorities. At the time, Senator Booker issued a statement noting: “I would have voted against this provision if I had the opportunity, not because I don’t have concerns about TikTok or its ownership structure–I do–but because I worry that Congress is missing an opportunity to address larger issues with social media in general, from screen addiction, to its negative effects on mental health, to the alarming impact it can have on the well-being of American children, to privacy, to the stunning proliferation of hate speech online, to its use for bullying and intimidation, to its toxic spread of misinformation, and many more. Congress should take on these broader challenges in a separate bill and have a full debate on them, and I worry the urgency to address them will be lost by this piecemeal approach.”

10:53:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) responded to the release of two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) studies on the health and safety risks faced by meatpacking workers. The findings highlight that meatpacking continues to be a job where workers have unacceptably high rates of injury. 

Meatpacking and slaughterhouse workers are required to handle animal carcasses on an assembly line with force, speed, and repetitive motions. The studies found that at existing processing line speeds, 81% of chicken processing plant workers and 46% of hog slaughter workers were at a significantly elevated risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome and other debilitating upper extremity disorders. These injuries can be long-term and life-changing. 

“These studies confirm that even our current line speeds are not safe for meatpacking workers  ,” said Senator Booker.  “It is unacceptable that meatpacking workers are expected to perform jobs that routinely cause physical injuries. Congress must act swiftly to pass legislation that improves workplace standards for the people who feed us.” 

Senator Booker’s  Industrial Agriculture Accountability Act  would ban increases to meat processing line speeds, to ensure that workers do not face additional workplace injuries.

Chairman Cotton Applauds Unanimous Supreme Court Decision to Uphold TikTok Ban 

Washington, D.C.  — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement on the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision to uphold the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. 

“ByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app. The Supreme Court correctly rejected TikTok’s lies and propaganda masquerading as legal arguments.”

Cotton Demands Army War College Refocus Priorities 

Washington, D.C.  — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today sent a letter to Army War College leaders Commandant Major General Hill and Command Sergeant Major Gregory demanding answers about an upcoming presentation titled  “Race, Gender, and Public Perceptions of Legitimate U.S. Drone Strikes: An Intersectional Approach.”  In the letter, Senator Cotton questions how such a presentation aligns with the Army’s core mission: to fight and win wars.   
  
In part, Senator Cotton wrote  : 

“The Army War College has one job: prepare our soldiers to fight and win our nation’s wars. We do not have time or resources to waste on frivolous topics that in no way advance that goal.” 

Full text of the letter may be found  here  and below. 

Commandant Major General David C. Hill 

Command Sergeant Major Charles W. Gregory Jr 

Army War College   
651 Wright Ave   
Carlisle, PA 17013-5234 

Dear Commandant Major General Hill and Command Sergeant Major Gregory, 

I write to express my concern that a professor at the Army War College is potentially conducting and promoting useless and fundamentally political research, possibly at the public’s expense. I also write to demand answers about the Army War College’s process for approving research topics and allocating resources to support those projects. 

A Lieutenant Colonel recently posted on X about an upcoming presentation to be held at the University of New Hampshire on February 10, 2025. The topic is “Race, Gender, and Public Perceptions of Legitimate U.S. Drone Strikes: An Intersectional Approach.” This topic has absolutely no bearing on the U.S. Army War College role as an institution whose stated goal is preparing Army leaders by “advancing knowledge in the global application of Landpower.” 

Please answer the following questions by January 30, 2025. 

  1. How is this research remotely useful in training future Army leaders? 
  2. Was this research approved by Army War College leadership? If so, what was the justification for doing so? Please describe the process for approving research topics and for determining if such research supports the needs of the Army. 
  3. If the research was not approved by the Army War College, why is an Army War College professor posting about this research using his Army affiliation? 



The Army War College has one job: prepare our soldiers to fight and win our nation’s wars. We do not have time or resources to waste on frivolous topics that in no way advance that goal. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. 

Sincerely, 

Tom Cotton 

United States Senator

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee held a hearing today to consider the nomination of Lee Zeldin to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If confirmed, Zeldin would be at the forefront of President Donald Trump’s promises to roll back energy and environmental regulations to unleash American energy development and production. 

Zeldin served in the Army from 2003 to 2007, then began his service in the Army Reserve, where he achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2015, where Cramer served with him for two terms. 

U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) questioned Zeldin on the role of cooperative federalism, particularly as it relates to the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) and the 2023 Supreme Court decision in  Sackett v. EPA  . He began by asking Zeldin if he would describe the  Sackett  majority opinion  “as prescriptive or ambiguous as it comes to the definition of a federally jurisdictional water.”  Zeldin responded that  “it was clear and prescriptive.” 

Cramer then asked Zeldin about how the EPA would handle a post-  Sackett  WOTUS rulemaking under his leadership. 

“There's one previous definition, where the entire state of North Dakota was basically a federal wetland,”  said  Cramer.  “We're a semi-arid state, with badlands and big prairies. Should you be confirmed, it would be really good if the administrator took this decision [Sackett], and the legislative history behind it, and start a rulemaking process post-Sackett with the assumption that states have primacy  and primary responsibility for water within their states, not the federal government. How do you intend to approach that?” 

“It's important that corners aren't cut where durability is sacrificed,”  answered Zeldin.  “  Laws are written by Congress, and there are cases that have come out from the Supreme Court that provide the EPA with clear guidance on how we must do our job under the law. It is important that when you are going back to your home state and you're speaking to your farmers, that you are able to, with confidence, be able to explain to them that the federal government is doing our part so they can define what Waters of the U.S. are without having them to go hire an attorney or someone else and pay a lot of money to ensure compliance.” 

Cramer finished his questioning by asking Zeldin about the existing burden on landowners to seek WOTUS jurisdictional determinations from the EPA. 

“Can we presume that on the very obvious, simple cases that the landowner or the developer already knows the law, and doesn't need to seek permission to do what they want to do?”  asked Cramer. 

“We face a reality where many farmers don't know whether or not their land, not just farmers, obviously, but a lot of people don't know whether or not their land has Waters  of the U.S. on it,”  responded Zeldin.  “And, I would say that that is a failure on the part of the federal government. You should be able to go to your landowners and they should be able to, with confidence, be able to tell you without having to ask questions  , whether or not Waters  of the U.S. are on their property.”

10:53:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – While Medicare has covered some chiropractic services since 1972, outdated provisions require beneficiaries to seek diagnostic tests elsewhere and then return to the chiropractor for covered care. 

U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the  Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act  , which would expand Medicare coverage of chiropractic services to ensure patients enrolled in the program can access care as a non-drug alternative for pain management. Additionally, it would expand Medicare coverage to include x-rays and other diagnostic services needed to determine and prescribe appropriate chiropractic treatments. 

The  Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act  is supported by the North Dakota Chiropractic Association (NDCA). 

“Medicare restrictions prevent chiropractors from offering patients a full scope of treatments or ordering diagnostic services for those who need them the most,”  said Cramer.  “This bipartisan legislation reduces barriers to care and supports access to non-drug treatment options for our seniors.” 

“Expanding Medicare coverage to include chiropractic service allows patients to access the quality care they deserve. Outdated regulations make it difficult for individuals to receive affordable treatments and often block them from receiving helpful, pain-relieving services. With the Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act, we put patients first and work to reduce barriers to care—allowing individuals to find the relief they need,”  said Senator Blumenthal. 

"Senator Cramer understands the challenges of delivering healthcare in rural areas like North Dakota—especially the challenges faced by seniors on Medicare who rely on help to stay active,”  said NDCA President, Dr. Allen Hager.  “The local chiropractor is sometimes the only healthcare professional in town and, more often, the only one where they can get a timely appointment. Health insurance coverage should not be a barrier to accessing the healthcare people need, especially for Medicare beneficiaries. The NDCA appreciates Senator Cramer’s support and thanks him for leading the fight for North Dakota seniors in Washington, DC." 

Additional cosponsors include U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Steve Daines (R-MT), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hoeven (R-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In February 1980, the United States Olympic Men’s Ice Hockey Team defeated the Soviet Union 4-3 in the semifinals of the 1980 Winter Olympic men’s hockey tournament in Lake Placid, New York. Team USA, comprised of 20 amateur collegiate hockey players including former University of North Dakota hockey player Dave Christian, defied expectations by defeating the four-time Olympic champion Soviet Union team in a game referred to as the “Miracle on Ice.” At a time when the United States was struggling with rampant stagflation, high gas prices, hostages held in Iran, and increased tensions with the Soviets after their invasion of Afghanistan, the Miracle on Ice was a turning point for American hockey and American patriotism. 

To recognize the 45th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice game, U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) introduced the  Miracle on Ice Congressional Gold Medal Act.  This legislation will award three Congressional Gold Medals to members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Men’s Ice Hockey Team in recognition of their extraordinary achievement at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. A companion measure of the legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Pete Stauber (R-MN-08). 

The three awards will be displayed at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum in Colorado, the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in Minnesota, and the Lake Placid Olympic Center in New York. 

“Not only is the ‘Miracle on Ice’ game a symbol of great teamwork and determination, but it really symbolizes the unity of our nation at the height of the Cold War, at a time when we really needed unity,”  said Cramer.  “I’m deeply honored to introduce the Miracle on Ice Congressional Gold Medal Act to recognize this historic and extraordinary achievement of the 1980 U.S. Men’s Hockey Team.” 

“In one of the greatest sports moments in American history, our nation witnessed a miracle when 20 college and minor league athletes on our U.S. Men’s Ice Hockey Team beat the vaunted Soviet Union Team at the 1980 Winter Olympic games in Lake Placid. The U.S. Team demonstrated great American fighting spirit and a gritty determination to prevail against all odds, that propelled them to a miraculous victory over the Soviet Red Army juggernaut and sparked pride and patriotism across the nation that has inspired generations of Americans since. They then went on to a come-from-behind win in the gold medal game against the Finns, cementing Lake Placid’s hallowed place in American sports history. I’m proud to introduce this legislation to award Congressional Gold Medals for one of America’s favorite and inspirational Olympic gold medal teams,”  said Senator Schumer.  “Great moments are born from great challenge, and 45 years later this win still resonates with so many Americans and serves as an indisputable moment of pride that unites the country. To paraphrase the broadcast that day by Al Michaels, decades later we ask: Do you still believe in miracles? YES! That is why we should commemorate this moment and Lake Placid’s place in American history by awarding this Olympic Gold Medal team with Congressional Gold Medals to be displayed at the Lake Placid Olympic Center and other Olympic and hockey exhibits across the country.” 

“Coach Herb Brooks and his team of young hockey players accomplished the impossible and made us all believe in miracles at a time when our nation really needed it,”  said Congressman Stauber.  “Minnesotans played an integral role in achieving this historic victory which is why I am so proud to reintroduce this legislation to honor this Olympic team. As we rapidly approach the 45th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice, it is a high priority of mine to get this passed in the immediate future because these American hockey heroes deserve to be celebrated.” 

Additional cosponsors of the  Miracle on Ice Congressional Gold Medal Act  include U.S. Senators  Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), John Curtis (R-UT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Gary Peters (D-MI). House cosponsors include U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (D-IL-05), Lisa McClain (R-MI-09), and Bill Keating (D-MA-09). 

“The 1980 U.S. Olympic Men’s Hockey Team is most deserving of receiving the Congressional Gold Medal,”  said Pat Kelleher, Executive Director of USA Hockey.  “Their unlikely run to the gold medal in Lake Placid, which included a historic win over the Soviet Union, inspired our nation at what was a very trying time. We encourage fans to contact their congressional representatives in support of this bill and its passage.” 

"The most special moments in sports actually transcend the playing surface,"  said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.  "Truly rare are those that captivate an entire nation and still resound nearly half a century later. The 1980 U.S. Olympic Men's Hockey Team's stunning victory over the Soviets in Lake Placid, New York, and its gold medal-clinching triumph over Finland two days later comprise perhaps the most memorable and impactful achievement in the history of athletics. We at the National Hockey League enthusiastically support the introduction of the Miracle on Ice Congressional Gold Medal Act and look forward to its passage in Congress and eventual signing by the president."

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) held a hearing today to hear testimony from Pete Hegseth regarding his expected nomination to be the 29th Secretary of Defense. If confirmed, Hegseth would oversee a U.S. Department of Defense of over 3 million people and a yearly budget of almost $900 billion, while also acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser to the President. 

Hegseth received a bachelor’s degree in politics from Princeton University in 2003 and a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard University in 2013 before serving as the co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend from 2016 to 2024. He served nearly 15 years in uniform, and deployed as an Army Combat Veteran who toured in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan. 

During the hearing, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) thanked Hegseth for the strong and unapologetic proclamation of faith in his opening statement. 

“First, I want to say thank you for your strong proclamation, unapologetic proclamation, of faith in Jesus Christ,”  said Cramer.  “I sat here and listened to your opening statement and thought, ‘Wow, this is a guy who, in today’s culture, is willing to stand up say the first thing is first: faith in Jesus Christ.’ I was reminded of what Christ said in Matthew, ‘But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.’ You are going to have a great future as our secretary, and I look forward to that day happening.” 

As Secretary of Defense, Hegseth has pledged to focus on rebuilding peace through strength, prioritizing America’s military readiness by replenishing its supply of ammunition, restoring the Warrior Ethos to the U.S. military, and reestablishing deterrence by focusing on lethality and maintaining America’s competitive edge. 

Hegseth’s orders to serve with his National Guard unit during the inauguration of President Joe Biden were revoked because of his Jerusalem Cross tattoo, which Hegseth’s detractors allege make him an extremist. Cramer asked him about the tattoo, to which Hegseth said it is a “historic Christian symbol” that was displayed on the front of program at President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and the floor of the National Cathedral. 

“It is a Christian religious symbol, and when the events happened preceding the Biden inauguration, I was a part of the mobilization to defend that inauguration,”  said  Hegseth  .  “I had orders to come to Washington, D.C. to guard that inauguration, and at the last minute, those orders were revoked. I never had orders revoked before. I’ve been on orders to a lot of places, to do a lot of difficult and dangerous things.” 

“I’d been identified as an extremist,”  continued  Hegseth  .  “And if that’s happening to me, Senator, how many other men and women? How many other patriots? How many other people of conscience? We haven’t even talked about COVID. […] Things like focusing on extremism, Senator, have created a climate inside our ranks that feel political when it hasn’t ever been political. Those are the types of things that are going to change.” 

Cramer thanked Hegseth for his pledge to defend freedom and identified his critics’ projection of hypocrisy. He explained “  the people who would deny you your expression of faith are the extremists. They’re the racists, they’re the bigots. You’re the one whose protecting their right to be one. Thank you for that.” 

In his opening statement, Hegseth said,  “leaders at all levels will be held accountable, and warfighting and lethality and the readiness of the troops and their families will be our only focus.”  Cramer said at that moment, in his mind’s eye, he heard soldiers, airmen, Marines, sailors, guardians from the Pentagon to the Pacific and everywhere in between, applaud. 

Hegseth has announced a plan to purge diversity, equity and inclusion accommodations and “woke” generals. Cramer asked Hegseth where the wokeness comes from, and who will be held accountable. 

“I think just about, maybe everyone, that wears the uniform that has ever come before this committee, or that I’ve met with privately, publicly, that I’ve been on tours with, that I’ve travelled with, that wear the uniform, whether it’s with four stars or no stars, agrees with that statement,”  said Cramer.  “There’s been a lot of talk about firing woke generals, creating the purge group, and all those things you and I have talked about. I would say give those men and women a chance under new leadership. […] I just would encourage you to trust them first, and look forward to them saluting the civilian leadership of this country." 

Hegseth responded by saying the wokeness comes from the political class. He explained when Donald Trump is sworn in, he will issue a new set of lawful orders, and the leadership of our services will have an opportunity to follow those lawful orders or not. Hegseth noted these  “lawful orders will not be based on politics. They will be based on readiness, accountability, standards, and lethality.” 

“In Donald Trump’s Pentagon, there will be real standards for success,”  said  Hegseth  . 

Cramer concluded by expressing his appreciation for the fact Hegseth emphasizes reputational deterrence,  “because deterrence is not a weapon system. It is an attitude.”

10:54:13 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:54:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: W  ASHINGTON  – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the  Historic Roadways Protection Act  to safeguard roads that were vital in shaping Utah's rich pioneer history. This bill comes as a response to the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) decisions to close over 1,000 miles of roads in Utah, including many that have significant historical value. 

  
Of the bill,  Senator Lee stated  , "  These roads aren't just pathways; they're a testament to Utah's rich history and the pioneers who shaped our state. It's crucial that we ensure their protection  so future generations can access their land.” 

“  Motorized access to Utah’s outdoors is critical for local economies and for recreation opportunities  ,"  said Senator Curtis.  “  My legislation simply requires that we know all valid historic routes, which are critical to understand what areas can be accessed, before BLM makes further travel management planning decisions  .” 

Of the bill,  Representative Kennedy said  , “  The Bureau of Land Management has a long history of overreach in rural Utah, and their attempt to make decisions about road access on public lands—before these roads are fully identified and established—is yet another overstep. I am pushing back with this legislation  .” 

“  Millions of Americans enjoy exploring Utah’s public lands because they are accessible  ,”  said Ben Burr Executive Director of BlueRibbon Coalition.  “  During the last four years, travel plans from the Bureau of Land Management have closed over 1,000 miles of spectacular county roads and backcountry routes that lead to dispersed campsites, scenic overlooks, and rugged adventures. Those exploring Utah’s public lands create substantial economic benefits for Utah’s rural communities. With the federal government under new management, we need a Grand Reopening of our public lands, and the Historic Roadways Protection Act is the proactive solution we need to reopen Utah’s public lands for Americans to enjoy.  ” 

Key Points: 

Historical Roads  : An 1866 law allowed for the creation of roads on public lands to help with western settlements. These historically important roads remained even after Congress updated the law in 1976. Today, over 1,000 miles of roads are at risk of closure by the BLM, including hundreds of miles of these historic roads. 

Legal Actions  : 22 counties in Utah are currently in court, advocating for the protection of these heritage roads. Given the volume of roads under discussion and the importance of the outcome, the Historic Roadways Protection Act proposes a halt on any road closures until these cases have been decided. 

Bill Specifics  : Senator Lee's bill prohibits using federal money to enact or enforce new travel plans in Utah until all the historic road cases have been settled. Additionally, Sen. Lee's legislation pauses any previous plans by the BLM to change how these lands may be traveled until the courts reach a decision on the old roads.

10:54:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:54:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – On Thursday, U.S. Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), joined Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS), and 10 of their SASC GOP colleagues in a letter to President Biden. The letter demands accountability for the Pentagon response to an Inspector General report on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s chain of command failures during his hospitalizations in 2023 and 2024. 

In the letter, the senators note that in two separate instances Secretary of Defense Austin’s failure to secure his chain of command and inform Congress could have led to a national security catastrophe. 

“For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress or in your administration knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary…At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan,”  the senators wrote.  “The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football…It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation.” 

The senators add that accountability for Secretary Austin is long overdue. 

“Secretary Austin must be held accountable for betraying his office, betraying the trust of the American people, violating the FVRA multiple times, and fumbling the nuclear football…The American people are sick of impunity for those at the top of our military – a blight that has become a defining feature of our Department of Defense,”  the senators wrote  . “In your last week in office, you must do the right thing and hold Secretary Austin accountable for his multiple failures to comply with the law and notify Congress of vacancies in his office.” 

In January 2024, SASC Republicans colleagues sent a letter addressed to Secretary Austin, posing many questions about his incapacitation that would only be addressed in the Inspector General report more than a year later. 

Sens. Mullin and Wicker were joined on this letter by U.S. Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tom Cotton (R-AK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Ted Budd (R-NC), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Jim Banks (R-IN), and Tim Sheehy (R-MT).

President Joseph R. Biden 

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 

Washington, DC 20500 

Dear Mr. President, 

Yesterday the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DOD OIG) released its report on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s multi-day absence in December 2023, and January 2024 based on his medical incapacitation. The report found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks failed to notify Congress, the White House, the Comptroller General, and key officials within the Department of Defense that Secretary Austin was incapacitated. The report confirmed what we already knew – these failures to notify were clear violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), a law that is rooted in the Constitutional principle that the people control their government. Alarmingly, the OIG report not only found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary Hicks violated the FVRA in December 2023 and January 2024, but they also violated it on two occasions in June 2024. These two additional violations were wholly unknown to Congress and demonstrate an utter disregard for oversight and accountability that should be completely unacceptable in the Department of Defense. 

For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary. In fact, for several days in December and January, not even Deputy Secretary Hicks knew that she was the acting Secretary. Once she found out, she, too, failed to notify Congress and the White House as required by law. At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan. The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football, and the entire American nuclear enterprise was left idling. 

It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation. While we applaud the OIG for its thorough and objective report, it is clear that political officers within the DOD obstructed and delayed the OIG’s work until it had no choice but to release the report five days before you and Secretary Austin are to leave office. 

There must be accountability for Secretary Austin’s irresponsible behavior, your administration’s multiple violations of the FVRA, and the mishandling of the nuclear football. Certainly, if a uniformed officer had done only one of these things he or she would be facing the end of their career. Sadly, those in charge seem to believe that the same standards do not apply to them. The American people will no longer accept a lack of accountability for the failures of our senior military leaders, whether civilian or uniformed. 

In your last week in office, you must do the right thing and hold Secretary Austin accountable for his multiple failures to comply with the law and notify Congress of vacancies in his office. 

Sincerely,  ###

10:54:34 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:54:34 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) joined U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) and U.S. Representative Michael Cloud (R-TX) in introducing the  No Retaining Every Gun In a System that Restricts Your (REGISTRY) Rights Act  . This legislation would prevent the U.S. government from creating a federal firearms registry. 

“The Constitution is crystal clear,”  said  Sen.  Mullin  . “The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. End of story. As your Senator, I will always fight to protect the privacy of lawful gun owners and defend your Second Amendment rights.” 

Sens. Mullin, Risch, and Rep. Cloud are joined on this legislation by U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and 47 members of the House of Representatives. 

The  No REGISTRY Rights Act  would: 

  * Require the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to delete all existing firearm transaction records. 
  * Allow federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to destroy transaction records when they go out of business; and 
  * Prevent the ATF from creating or maintaining a firearms registry in the future. 



Under current law, FFLs are required to transfer firearm transaction records to the ATF when the businesses close. These records are stored in the ATF’s Out-of-Business Records Imaging System, which now holds nearly one billion records. This database lays the groundwork for a federal firearms registry. 

In April 2022, the Biden administration published a final rule demanding that FFLs preserve all firearm transaction records indefinitely. Since 1984, federal regulations have allowed FFLS to discard records older than 20 years, as the “time-to-crime”—the period between a firearm’s last known legal sale and its use in a crime—rarely exceeds two decades.

10:54:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:54:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – On Thursday, U.S. Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) joined the fellas of the Ruthless Variety Progrum. He traded laughs, stories from the gym, and unpacked his travels with President Donald J. Trump. Most importantly, Senator Mullin previewed Republican priorities for the 119th Congress, detailed the budget reconciliation process, and spoke about the importance of delivering on the Trump mandate for America. 

Sen. Mullin’s full interview can be found  here  . 

On the plan when President Trump takes office: 

“Communicating what he [President Trump] wants to get done in those first 100 days is so important. He started with the House, and the way I describe the House—this is no disrespect, Ilove the House, love my friends over there, I still go over there all the time, I go to at least half the House conferences, I go to a lot of the RSC meetings because I just have friends over there—is it’s thoughtful but yet right now— dysfunctional body. You can’t argue with that, they don’t. But the president started with them, visiting with them on Saturday and was communicating with them on what we need to do with reconciliation. That’s his big deal. The House has to get the budget, has to get reconciliation moving. The Senate, we have to get reconciliation and then we also have to do confirmations… 

“The way he’s moving and the pace he’s moving, it’s a little odd for the Senate to move this fast, but he’s setting the pace. So, by coming here and laying out expectations and answering questions and being accountable to the senators to make sure that it’s clear communication with him and while he moves into the White House is vital and that’s what he’s going to continue to do. I mean he’s just a leader.” 

On budget reconciliation with his GOP colleagues in the House and Senate: 

“This has gotten blown out of proportion and I’ve said this with the media, I’m so sick of it. It’s like, ‘Hey what is it? Why is there already contention? Does this signal that there’s going to be contention between the White House and the chambers?’ like no, hold on a second, we’re two separate bodies. We’re going to deliver. It’s just the process, how do we get that done? What can the House do and what can the Senate get done? More than likely if the House can get a reconciliation passed, it’s going to be one bill, and the reason why is just real simple… 

“The dynamics is different for us… 

“The American people hate big bills, yeah I get that, but that’s part of negotiations. You got to have, and it has to be done, it’s not like this big omnibus bill that’s got a lot of fat in it. We’re talking about things that through reconciliation has to get done. These are President Trump’s priorities, right? So, if we have to do two, fine. We’ll do two. If we can only get one passed, then we’ll get one passed. The thing is we would like the House to move first, but the House isn’t necessarily in reconciliation. They have to move first on the budget. They don’t have to necessarily move first on reconciliation. So, if they can’t get it done, then we may move a simple package first: energy and border, but then it really puts us in a situation with taxes. The president has been very clear, he’s okay with one bill. He’s okay with two. People will say ‘well that’s not very clear.’ No, his clear point is that he just wants it done. He wants results. That’s all he wants. The difference between the two, it doesn’t matter. The bodies are going to work their will, and we’re going to eventually deliver for the president and for the American people. It’s going to get done.” 

On why making President Trump’s promises permanent is so important: 

“Let’s get back to why the president wanted one bill. He wanted to make his executive orders permanent. Because executive orders, as we saw four years ago, can be overturned like that and wreak havoc on the energy sector and on our border. So the president can go in on day one reinstate those hundreds of executive orders that President Biden put in place in the first 96 days he was in office that undid energy policy that the president had that released an energy economic boom where we became an exporter of crude for the first time ever and saw prices at a very reasonable, sometimes very low, price which spurred the economy along. You saw a very secure border. Right before he left office, we had the most secure border we had had in decades. So the president can go in there and enact those immediately. Then we have to have reconciliation to make them permanent, but they’re permanent for only 10 years.”

10:54:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — In case you missed it, the Los Angeles Times  recently highlighted  U.S. Senator Alex Padilla’s (D-Calif.)  package of three bipartisan bills  to strengthen wildfire resilience and rebuilding efforts in response to the devastating Southern California wildfires. Padilla emphasized the importance of working together in wildfire response and recovery efforts, advocating for “smarter” policies to rebuild stronger and more sustainably, and to ensure our federal wildland firefighting workforce can continue keeping communities safe. 

The package featured in the article includes the  Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act  to protect firefighter pay, the  Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act  to bolster the pre-deployment of essential firefighting assets, and the  Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act  to expand and streamline disaster housing response. 

Key Excerpts: 

  * While firefighters continue to battle the Los Angeles County fires, California’s Sen. Alex Padilla is introducing a package of bills to increase their pay and create housing for those affected by disasters — which could later add to the state’s affordable housing supply.  “Just like the firefighters on the lines right now, putting out the fires, we have to work together in our response and our recovery,” Padilla said in an interview with The Times in his U.S. Senate office. 


  * His proposal, the Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act, ties together two of California’s top priorities: wildfire assistance and affordable housing. …  “We can be a little bit smarter about this and allow for the use of modular homes, manufactured homes that are themselves a little bit more sustainable, more resilient,” he said.  “Once the disaster is over and folks are moving back into their communities, maybe utilize them, retain them locally for affordable housing.”  The measure could serve as “another tool in the toolbox,” Padilla said  , noting that some landlords already are price gouging in the wake of the fires. 


  * “In California, we know that when it’s hot and it’s been dry and the winds kick up, it’s a recipe for disaster. So we can anticipate those conditions. Let’s start putting personnel and equipment in place just in case,” Padilla said  , adding that he checks the fires’ progression on the WatchDuty app hourly. “If we can ensure that the program will pick up at least 75% of that, that’s a huge incentive for state and local governments to be able to do just that, with less concern for the budget.” 


  * Firefighter pay has been the subject of legislation in the last few years, as President Biden raised the minimum wage from $13 to $15 an hour for wildland firefighters in 2021.  Padilla’s legislation is aimed at beefing up the Forest Service’s ability to recruit and retain firefighters with promises of higher pay.

Padilla hopes to increase firefighter pay, create affordable housing for disaster response 

By Seema Mehta and Faith E. Pinho 

  * One bill would increase wildland firefighter pay to help recruit and retain federal firefighters. 
  * Another would allow for disaster housing to transition into affordable housing. 
  * The third bill would increase FEMA funding for positioning firefighting tools in high-risk areas before disaster strikes. 



While firefighters continue to battle the Los Angeles County fires, California’s Sen. Alex Padilla is introducing a package of bills to increase their pay and create housing for those affected by disasters — which could later add to the state’s affordable housing supply. 

“Just like the firefighters on the lines right now, putting out the fires, we have to work together in our response and our recovery,” Padilla said in an interview with The Times in his U.S. Senate office. 

His proposal, the Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act, ties together two of California’s top priorities: wildfire assistance and affordable housing. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency will be providing temporary housing, such as trailers, to many of the thousands of people who lost their homes in the wildfires. Padilla’s bill, which he is co-leading with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to quickly create housing that could later function as longer-term, affordable housing. 

“We can be a little bit smarter about this and allow for the use of modular homes, manufactured homes that are themselves a little bit more sustainable, more resilient,” he said. “Once the disaster is over and folks are moving back into their communities, maybe utilize them, retain them locally for affordable housing.” 

The measure could serve as “another tool in the toolbox,” Padilla said, noting that some landlords already are price gouging in the wake of the fires. 

Another measure, the Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act, would expand funding from FEMA for firefighting tools that are put in place before a disaster. The bill would allow for FEMA to cover more of those resources at times of high wildfire risk, before disaster strikes. 

“In California, we know that when it’s hot and it’s been dry and the winds kick up, it’s a recipe for disaster. So we can anticipate those conditions. Let’s start putting personnel and equipment in place just in case,” Padilla said, adding that he checks the fires’ progression on the WatchDuty app hourly. “If we can ensure that the program will pick up at least 75% of that, that’s a huge incentive for state and local governments to be able to do just that, with less concern for the budget.” 

Padilla recalled a trip he took as a staff member for the late U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), with a former FEMA director in 1996, to survey wildfire damage. Leaders have learned much about fire prevention techniques since then, he noted, such as building with nonflammable materials and clearing brush away from houses. 

Padilla is also bringing back the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act, which was not voted on after he introduced it during the last Congress, to raise wages for federal firefighters, including premium pay for those fighting long fires. Firefighter pay has been the subject of legislation in the last few years, as President Biden raised the minimum wage from $13 to $15 an hour for wildland firefighters in 2021. Padilla’s legislation is aimed at beefing up the Forest Service’s ability to recruit and retain firefighters with promises of higher pay. 

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, federal firefighters make, on average, slightly less than state or local firefighters. California unsurprisingly is home to the most firefighters of any states, and pays the best too. A 2019 study from BLS reported that California paid an average annual salary of $84,370.

10:54:37 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:54:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — As devastating wildfires rage across Southern California, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced a package of three bipartisan bills to strengthen wildfire resilience and rebuilding efforts. The package includes the  Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act  to protect firefighter pay, the  Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act  to bolster the pre-deployment of essential firefighting assets, and the  Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act  to streamline the construction of temporary disaster housing. 

The devastating fires across Southern California that broke out on Tuesday, January 7, have killed more than two dozen individuals and burned down more than 12,000 structures, forcing hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles residents to evacuate. The fires have burned over 40,000 acres — including over 23,000 from the Palisades Fire and over 14,000 from the Eaton Fire as wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour accelerated the fires’ growth and inhibited firefighters’ efforts to contain the blaze for days. 

“I’ve spent the last week seeing firsthand the devastation caused by the fires ravaging Southern California — people who have lost loved ones, families who have lost the homes their children and grandchildren grew up in, and businesses and places of worship reduced to rubble,”  said Senator Padilla.  “These bills would improve readiness, response, and recovery for disasters that are becoming all too common across the county, from expanding and expediting disaster housing options to investing in essential prepositioned firefighting forces. And we must make sure the federal firefighters laying their lives on the line to protect our communities are given a permanent pay raise. As fires continue to rage across Los Angeles County, I’ll keep fighting to secure extensive federal collaboration and disaster aid to help impacted families get back on their feet and rebuild their communities.” 

“Montana’s wildland firefighters bravely put their lives on the line to protect our lands and our communities. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan bill to make the well-deserved pay raise permanent and will always support those on the front lines who serve our communities selflessly,”  said Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.), co-lead of the  Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act  . 

“Floods, wildfires, typhoons, earthquakes, and blizzards are just some of the natural disasters that impact Alaskans every year,”  said Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), co-lead of the  Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act  .  “We are not alone in these catastrophes. Our prayers are with the people of southern California who have been impacted by the terrible wildfires this week. States like Alaska and California, with our vast size and elevated risk, often need greater federal assistance to respond to and recover from these kinds of crises. I want to thank Senator Padilla for working with me on this legislation to give FEMA the flexibility and authority to increase its funding match to ensure Alaskans, Californians, and all Americans have the resources they need to quickly and fully recover, while also strategically mitigating disaster risks to our communities.” 

“Leaving disaster victims without a roof over their heads is not an option. We must change the way we respond to storms and wildfires,”  said Dr. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), sponsor of the  Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act  .  “This is a better way to provide more resilient and longer-lasting housing that allows communities to recover quickly.” 

“Wildland firefighters put their lives on the line to protect our communities, homes, and loved ones. It’s our responsibility to ensure their pay is commensurate with the critical and dangerous nature of the work they do in order to support recruitment and retention. In order to swiftly rebuild and recover, we must also ensure that state and local governments have the resources they need for wildfire prevention and response efforts. These bills will help accomplish both objectives,”  said Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). 

“Two of the most critical actions we can take to improve wildfire response in our country are protecting federal wildland firefighters’ pay and ensuring we are proactive in preparing for and responding to the threat of wildfires,”  said Senator Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.).  “I am proud to join my colleagues on this commonsense legislation that will ensure we have the backs of the brave first responders on the frontlines of these disasters and improve initial attack success rates by pre-positioning resources to prevent large-scale tragedies.” 

“Wildland firefighters are currently on the front lines battling historic and dangerous fires. As climate change grows the risk for catastrophic wildfires in New Mexico and across the West, it’s critical that we invest in increased wildland firefighter pay, capacity, housing, mental health, and well-being,”  said Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).  “Congress needs to act now to permanently raise wildland firefighter pay, and that’s what this legislation does. I won’t stop fighting to provide our heroic wildland firefighters with the pay and benefits they have long deserved.” 

Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act 

This bipartisan legislation, co-led by Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.), helps ensure the federal government can recruit and retain a sufficient wildland firefighting workforce to keep communities safe. The  Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act of 2025  would prevent the worst-case scenario for federal wildland firefighters and avert an automatic pay cut. The bill would protect the pay raise  secured  for wildland firefighters in the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . 

Given the lower pay and grueling nature of the work, there is grave concern about the ability to meet the staffing and labor levels required to adequately respond to wildfires across the country. In a 2022 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO)  concluded that low pay  was the most commonly cited barrier to federal wildland firefighter recruitment and retention. 

The  Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act  would prevent attrition and provide long-term workforce stability. Specifically, the bill would: 

  * Permanently Increase Federal Wildland Firefighter Pay.  The bill would avoid the impending pay cliff by permanently increasing wildland firefighter pay at levels at or near those enacted within the current temporary increase. 


  * Establish a New Pay Scale for Wildland Firefighters.  The bulk of the pay increases within the bill are realized via the establishment of a new pay scale for wildland firefighters at all grade levels, similar to the General Schedule (GS) pay scale that is applicable to most federal employees. 


  * Establish Additional Pay Supplements for Wildland Firefighters.  Base pay would be supplemented by pay for each day a firefighter is deployed on a wildland fire. The legislation would provide for specialized premium pay for wildland firefighters who respond to certain prolonged fire incidents, including those like the Southern California fires that are not contained within 36 hours. 


  * Require Consistency in Agencies’ Policies Related to Work-Life Balance.  To limit burnout, the bill directs agencies to work to make existing policies consistent and to study opportunities to ensure proper paid rest and recuperation for wildland firefighters to lessen burnout. 



“The National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) and the federal wildland firefighters we represent have been sounding the alarm for years about increasingly dangerous wildfires and our country’s inability to contain them,”  said NFFE National President Randy Erwin.  “The brave men and women on the front lines of the fire crisis need to be paid a living wage for the incredibly skilled and hazardous work they do to protect American communities. No federal wildland firefighter should have to live out of their car or chase thousands of hours of overtime just to make ends meet. Federal wildland firefighters have made it clear that they can no longer endure the uncertainty that comes with a pay cliff or a temporary pay raise. We are already facing a massive shortage of wildland firefighters nationwide, and the end result is what we have witnessed in Los Angeles, where Americans have died and entire communities have been completely destroyed. Congress must pass the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act if protecting our country from wildfires is a priority.” 

In 2023, Padilla and a bipartisan group of  Senators urged  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to avoid mass resignations within the wildland firefighter ranks by ensuring the prompt passage of their bipartisan legislation. Padilla and a bipartisan group of Senators also  urged the Biden Administration  to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters to prevent staffing shortages and strengthen wildfire response efforts in 2022. Following that request,  the Administration announced  a temporary pay raise. Padilla and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein previously called on the Administration to increase wildland firefighter pay in 2021. 

Senators Adam Schiff, Tim Sheehy, Martin Heinrich, and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) are cosponsoring the legislation.

Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act 

This bill, co-led by Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), would ensure that pre-deployed state and local fire suppression assets are eligible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) and allow flexibility for the federal cost share of such grants to be increased beyond 75 percent. 

The maximum 75 percent federal cost share currently allowed for the FMAG program differs from other FEMA programs that allow for flexibility for the administration to grant a higher federal cost share during extreme events like the Southern California wildfires. The state must pay the remaining 25 percent for actual costs, with no flexibility for consecutive FMAGs or extreme circumstances. 

This bill would make FMAGs consistent with other FEMA disaster assistance by stating that the federal cost share of FMAGs shall be not less than 75 percent of the eligible cost of such assistance. This bill does not mandate any increase but simply allows for additional flexibility. FMAGs are granted on an incident-by-incident basis, and as we have seen across the West, fires often occur in the same area consecutively in the same year. 

Senators Adam Schiff and Tim Sheehy are cosponsoring the legislation.

Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act 

This legislation, sponsored by Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), would expedite, expand, and improve temporary housing available to victims of disasters like wildfires and storms. The bill instructs FEMA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a five-year pilot program to expand the entities that can participate and the types of housing options (e.g. modular and manufactured housing) available for federal disaster housing. It also allows these units to be transferred to certain entities such as a local public housing authority or an affordable housing program to ensure long-term use of these structures. 

The bill also expands FEMA assistance to go beyond home repair and replacement to include closing costs related to buying new homes through federal affordable housing financing (cost of appraisal, title searches, etc.). 

The new housing would more closely resemble typical affordable housing. To ensure quality and livability, the home construction standards would be consistent with federal standards on permanent housing, including those for flood management and natural disaster resilience. Once disaster victims can return to permanent homes, the property could then be transitioned to help increase the local affordable housing supply.

Senator Padilla has long been a leader in strengthening the federal and state response to wildfires. His  legislation to strengthen  FEMA’s wildfire preparedness and response efforts, the  FIRE Act  , became law in 2022. Padilla also successfully advocated for California to receive billions for wildfire response and drought relief in the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . After years of delays due to contracting issues, Padilla  secured an amendment  to the  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2024  to finalize the transfer of seven C-130s from the Coast Guard to California to  retrofit for fighting  wildfires. The first of these planes  began fighting  deadly wildfires this summer and has been instrumental in fighting the ongoing Southern California fires. 

Most recently, Padilla  secured an amendment  to bolster the FireGuard program, which utilizes military satellites to help fight wildfires, as part of the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2025  . Last month, he successfully secured unanimous Senate passage of the  Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act  , which includes  Padilla’s bipartisan legislation  to provide critical tax relief for wildfire survivors who have received compensation for the losses and damages they have suffered and was signed into law last month. He also previously introduced the  Fire Suppression Improvement Act  , a bill to help ease the burden on state and local governments who are shouldering the weight of increasingly devastating wildfires.

10:54:38 root         DEBUG    Desc: WATCH  : Padilla urges Burgum to respond to wildfires with all necessary resources 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) questioned Secretary of the Interior nominee Doug Burgum on his support for wildfire aid for California and increased wildland firefighter pay during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. 

As the Los Angeles wildfires continue to rage, Padilla emphasized that disaster aid has never come with conditions attached nor has it ever been a partisan issue. He noted that Burgum, North Dakota’s former governor, requested a major disaster declaration for historic wildfires in the northwestern part of the state last year, which President Biden approved quickly and unconditionally. If confirmed, Burgum committed to responding to wildfires regardless of which state they impact with all necessary resources and support possible. 

Additionally, Padilla pushed Burgum to support a permanent pay raise for federal firefighters. Padilla highlighted his  longtime work  to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain a sufficient wildland firefighting workforce to keep communities safe. He has long sought to avert an automatic pay cut and protect the pay raise  secured  for wildland firefighters in the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . 

The Interior Department currently employs more than 5,000 federal wildland fire personnel. The Office of Wildland Fire within the Interior Department supports wildland fire management by investing approximately $1.75 billion each year to reduce wildfire risk, respond to wildfires, support the wildland firefighter workforce, and bolster wildfire recovery. 

At least 1,000 federal firefighters have been part of the disaster response to the Los Angeles wildfires. Burgum called federal firefighters “essential” and praised them for their work on the ground in Los Angeles and in North Dakota previously. 

Key Excerpts: 

  * PADILLA:  We’ve all seen the devastation of recent fires in Southern California. As we speak here today, more than 40,000 acres burned, 12,000 structures plus destroyed, more than two dozen people who have perished. That number is probably going to grow. It’s clear it’s been one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history. 


  * PADILLA:  For the record, there’s never been strings attached to disaster relief, and I certainly hope this is not the first case. So I would ask, as this plays out in Congress over the next several months, if you’re fortunate to be confirmed as Interior Secretary, you know, you wouldn’t be the one deciding on whether or not to grant disaster declarations, but the department is significant, particularly when it comes to wildfire response. Would you commit to responding to every disaster with as much support and resources possible, regardless of which state or jurisdiction the disaster is in? 


  * BURGUM:  Well, absolutely, but I would say I would go a step further. 


  * PADILLA:  Last session, I began another bipartisan effort with Senator Daines to permanently protect the pay increases for federal firefighters that Congress had previously approved. Side note, there’s currently about 1,000 brave federal firefighters that are part of the tremendous response. It’s not just locals, it’s not just state firefighters, but through mutual aid, a number of jurisdictions there, including federal firefighters. If confirmed, are you committed to supporting wildland firefighters because the recruitment and retention challenges, I mean, a number of reasons, but compensation has certainly been one of them? 


  * BURGUM:  Well, it’s a dangerous and very hard job, but it’s an essential job. And I know again from my own recent experience, this was just October, early first week of October, we lost two lives in North Dakota as part of these raging wildfires that were tearing across the prairie. I had a chance immediately after that to meet with local volunteers and local firefighter units and our small state fire front team, our National Guard that was out and including at least a lot of citizens that jumped in, as they did in California, to try to save their own homes. I think we all have got a greater appreciation for that role.

WATCH  : Padilla speaks on the Senate floor, urging his colleagues to support aid for Southern California 

WASHINGTON, D.C  . — As devastating wildfires rage across California, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging his Republican colleagues and President-elect Trump to provide essential disaster recovery aid to California without conditioning it on the passage of partisan legislation. 

Several Senate and House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, have indicated they will leverage disaster aid as a bargaining chip to require specific conditions that advance their political agenda. This threat runs in stark contrast to how both Democrats and Republicans have responded to previous crises for years. 

Padilla emphasized that California has been there to support other states in their time of need with no strings attached, and pushed Congress to do the same for California in return. He further underscored that in 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion dollars more to the federal government than it received, making it the largest contributing state of tax revenue in the nation by far. 

Fueled by wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour, the Southern California fires have burned over 12,000 structures and over 40,000 acres — nearly three times the size of Manhattan. Over two dozen Angelenos have lost their lives, and that number is expected to rise as urban search and rescue teams continue to survey the damage from the worst natural disaster in Los Angeles history. Padilla applauded the brave firefighters, first responders, and local heroes who have worked tirelessly to put out these disastrous fires and provide hope for Southern California survivors. 

He also extended an invite to President-elect Trump to see the destruction in Southern California communities like Altadena and Pacific Palisades, where over 37,000 acres have burned since early last week. 

Key Excerpts: 

  * Over the course of the last week, I’ve had the opportunity to visit command posts and meet with firefighters; had the opportunity to distribute meals to many of the victims and to see, to tour, to visit the destruction firsthand. Yes, there are survivors, people impacted from communities like the Pacific Palisades, some with names and faces that you’ll recognize from television and the entertainment industry. But I assure you there’s also a lot of other faces and families that you won’t recognize from the working-class and diverse communities throughout Los Angeles County. 


  * I’ve been saying over and over that every house you see is really a home, and every home represents a family. A family who now mourns maybe the loss of a relative, maybe the loss of their home. Or a loss of irreplaceable items like family photo albums. Or a wedding dress. Or baby pictures. Of a loved one’s red, white, and blue military burial flag. But through the destruction, we’ve also seen some signs of hope. 


  * Our hearts go out to all the impacted families and they also go out to the heroic firefighters and other first responders working tirelessly through multi-day shifts to put out these fires. Not only the brave state and local firefighters, but I want to acknowledge the federal firefighters, too. To the state and local officials working day and night to protect our state and our communities, thank you. And I also want to acknowledge Governor Newsom for his steady hand during this time. 


  * We are so grateful to our neighboring states who continue to send resources. And no, not just states that are considered blue states like Oregon and Washington, but states that many people refer to as red states like South Dakota and Wyoming and Montana and Florida who continue to send resources with no strings attached, no conditions. This is what we do for each other. There’s a reason why it’s called mutual aid. 


  * Soon there will come a time when we need to more than just support our response to these disasters. We’ll need support for our recovery. And we expect Congress to support California, just as Congress has been there for states across the country in their times of crisis — with no conditions and no strings attached. Because our recovery isn’t just a California fight. We’re truly in this together as Americans. 


  * Whether it’s wildfires across the western United States, or tornados in the Midwest, ice storms in Texas, or hurricanes in the Southeast, Mother Nature does not distinguish between red states and blue states. And neither should our disaster response efforts or our recovery efforts. 


  * So when I hear about political jabs and insults on social media while my home state is burning, it’s not distracting. It’s certainly not entertaining. It’s offensive. And it is dangerous. Because let’s be clear: in times of crisis, California has always been there for the rest our country. And now, we expect our country to be here for California. 


  * And to President-elect Trump, I too invite you to tour Altadena and Pacific Palisades, which, by the way, is just about 30 miles from your golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes. Come meet the first responders. Come meet the families that have been affected by these fires. 


  * It’s a long road and there will be challenges to overcome indeed, but I promise you this: that there will be a day when the fires are put out, when the homes and entire communities are rebuilt — better and more resilient than they’ve been before.

He also previously introduced the  Fire Suppression Improvement Act  , a bill to help ease the burden on state and local governments who are shouldering the weight of increasingly devastating wildfires.

10:54:40 root         DEBUG    Desc: WATCH  : Padilla criticizes Bondi for refusing to uphold constitutional birthright citizenship 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) questioned U.S. Attorney General nominee Pamela Jo Bondi during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Bondi was one of the leading defense lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump during his first impeachment trial and supported Trump’s false claims of 2020 presidential election fraud. Padilla joined his Democratic colleagues in expressing concerns about Bondi’s ability to run the Department of Justice independently and free from the improper influence of President-elect Trump. 

As Trump threatens to revoke birthright citizenship from millions of Americans, Padilla pressed Bondi for a commitment to uphold the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship for people born in the United States — including to parents who are undocumented. Bondi declined to defend birthright citizenship and instead said she would “study” it. However, Padilla successfully pushed Bondi to disagree with President-elect Trump’s hateful rhetoric that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” 

Padilla also questioned Bondi about the central role that she played in originating and spreading lies about the 2020 election — specifically her allegations of “cheating,” for which she is to this day unable to provide any evidence. Bondi traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the day after the general presidential election in 2020 to appear alongside Rudy Giuliani where she falsely asserted that Trump had won Pennsylvania despite there being at least 1 million ballots still left to count. Since then, Bondi has continued to double down on President-elect Trump’s Big Lie and, when pressed by Padilla, she refused to answer a “yes or no” question on whether she had evidence to support the Big Lie or to retract her previous statements. 

As Florida Attorney General, Bondi defended strict state abortion laws, including mandatory waiting periods and parental consent requirements. Padilla  secured  Bondi’s commitment that she would not let her personal beliefs on abortion influence her actions in office. 

Key Excerpts: 

PADILLA:  In the following days, even after the results were clear, you continued to double down on the Big Lie, promoting falsehoods about election fraud and cheating without offering any actual evidence, and I remember it clearly because I served as California Secretary of State at the time, and I invited anybody associated with the Trump campaign who was making these claims to come forward with evidence of irregularities in the election or massive voter fraud. Four years later, I still have seen none. 

[…] 

PADILLA:  Do you have evidence? Yes or no? 

BONDI:  I traveled to Pennsylvania. 

PADILLA:  Do you have the evidence? Yes or no? 

BONDI:  I traveled, Senator, to Pennsylvania. 

PADILLA:  Okay, you’re not answering my question. If you have no evidence to offer, let me ask you this, will you now retract your previous statements that Trump won Pennsylvania in the 2020 election? Yes or no? 

BONDI:  Oh, Senator, I traveled to Pennsylvania, and let me tell you what I saw firsthand. 

PADILLA:  Yes or no? 

[…] 

PADILLA:  It’s imperative, Ms. Bondi, that you subscribe to facts and evidence and not politically convenient conspiracy theories. Your job will be, I’m speaking, your job will be to protect voters and election workers, not to undermine and dox them. 

[…] 

PADILLA:  On the 14th Amendment, now you’ve testified repeatedly to this committee that you will uphold the laws of this country and defend the Constitution of the United States. Do you believe birthright citizenship is the law of the land, and will you defend it regardless of, [for] a child born in the United States, regardless of their parents’ immigration status? 

BONDI:  Senator, I will study birthright citizenship. I would love to meet with you regarding birthright citizenship. Can I answer the question? 

PADILLA:  You’re asking us to consider you to serve as Attorney General of the United States, and you still need to study the 14th Amendment of the Constitution? That is not helping me have more confidence in your ability to do this job. 

[…] 

PADILLA:  When you were a Florida Attorney General, you defended restrictive abortion laws, including mandatory waiting periods and parental consent requirements. If confirmed as Attorney General, would you advocate for similar restrictions at the federal level? 

BONDI:  I will follow the law of the United States of America. 

PADILLA:  Okay, well I’m asking this question because there is a difference between federal law and Florida law. There is a difference between the law and your personal views. … How would you ensure your personal views don’t influence your decisions as Attorney General in cases involving reproductive health? 

BONDI:  Oh, my personal, no, my personal feelings would not influence, Senator.

10:54:40 root         DEBUG    Desc: WATCH  : Padilla presses Wright on past comments calling wildfires “just hype” to promote climate policies 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) questioned U.S. Secretary of Energy nominee Chris Wright in a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing amid the devastating ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles. The wildfires have destroyed more than 40,000 acres of land, burned down over 12,000 structures, and taken more than two dozen lives — the most destructive disasters in Los Angeles history. 

Padilla called out Wright, Liberty Energy CEO and a former California resident, for his  2023 LinkedIn post  denying the link between climate change and the rise in more frequent and severe fires. Wright wrote that, “The hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies.” Padilla pressed him whether he still considered wildfires to just be “hype” to promote climate policy after unseasonably dry vegetation and extremely high winds — both a direct result of climate change — exacerbated the Southern California wildfires. Wright stood by his remarks. 

Padilla also pushed Wright for reposting a social media post that said, “Now obviously, burning to death in a fire is pretty grim but that is not what is happening like the climate zealots would like you to believe.” 

Additionally, Padilla secured Wright’s commitment to publishing non-classified Department of Energy (DOE) research. This is especially important amid risks that the incoming Trump Administration could try to withhold, censor, or suppress critical DOE research and studies. Padilla also highlighted Wright’s expressed interest in pulling back federal subsidies for mature industries, including for oil and gas. 

Key Excerpts: 

PADILLA:  Despite the misinformation that’s circulating here in the Capitol, in Southern California, and everywhere in between, it’s clear that these fires only reached the size and the scale that they have because of unseasonably dry vegetation and extremely high winds, both of which are a direct result of climate change. Mr. Wright, thank you for being here. But as you’ve seen this last week, the climate crisis and its deadly effects is very real to my neighbors and my constituents. 

As we discussed in our meeting yesterday, you were a long-time resident of California, so you’ve seen the conditions evolve firsthand. So I’ve got to tell you, I was pretty disappointed to come across some social media posts of yours, and I’ll quote, understand you’ve written that “the hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies.” Given the devastation that we’re currently experiencing in Los Angeles do you still believe that wildfires are just hype? 

WRIGHT:  Sir, it is with great sorrow and fear that I watch what’s happening in your city of LA and those fires. 

PADILLA:  Do you think it’s just hype or not? 

WRIGHT:  Climate change is a real and global phenomenon. 

PADILLA:  Is it hype or not? 

WRIGHT:  I stand by my past comment. 

PADILLA:  So you believe it’s hype. 

WRIGHT:  Climate change is a real– 

PADILLA:  Tell that to the families of the more than two dozen lost in these fires and counting because urban search and rescue teams are still going property by property with cadaver dogs. That number is going to climb. I’m disappointed, Mr. Wright. 

Let me make reference to another element of your social media. You reposted a statement, so not your words, but you felt it important enough to amplify a social media post, and I’ll quote, “Now obviously, burning to death in a fire is pretty grim but that is not what is happening like the climate zealots would like you to believe.” 

So again, to the families of more than a couple dozen of my constituents who have died in these fires, and that number is growing, like I mentioned, do you believe that Californians who have died over the past week are somehow just a figment of our imagination? 

WRIGHT:  Of course, not, Senator, it is, it is heart wrenching to watch the destruction, most importantly of people’s lives. 

PADILLA:  I agree. And I’m not sorry for cutting you off here. I think the point has been made, and you’re standing by your posts, and I assume the reposts as well.

10:54:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senators Marshall and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) are continuing the push for Sarah’s Law to honor the memory of  Sarah Root  , a 21-year old woman who was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant drunk driving, and close the loophole in federal law that allowed her killer to escape justice when he was released by federal law enforcement. The Senators’ bill will work in tandem with the  Laken Riley Act  to close loopholes in federal law that have caused a regular occurrence of innocent Americans falling victim to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. 

Sarah’s Law amends the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. It also requires that upon encountering an illegal immigrant subject to mandatory detention, ICE must make reasonable efforts to identify victims and inform their families of certain information. 

Joining Senators Marshall and Ernst in introducing Sarah’s Law are Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Katie Britt (R-AL), James Lankford (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ted Budd (R-NC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), Jim Risch (R-ID), John Curtis (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and John Kennedy (R-LA).

“The Kansas Forest Service provides invaluable manpower, equipment, resources and expertise to help local firefighting units across our state battle fires of all types,”  said Senator Marshall.  “This new facility will not only provide invaluable training opportunities, but will allow the Forest Service to continue its important work of overhauling used equipment for use by local fire departments.” 

The new Kansas Forest Service facility will include a larger, modernized fire equipment shop to allow the agency to continue its work of retrofitting used military equipment for use by local fire departments. It will also include an emergency response training lab and classroom for continued workforce development and instruction, which is in line with the state’s Wildfire Task Force recommendations for improving wildfire mitigation and response efforts.

Senator Marshall discussed how Bessent will deliver for small town America, champion and reform the  45Z tax credit  , and extend the Trump tax cuts. 

During Scott Bessent’s opening statement, he discussed how he will help deliver President Trump’s America First agenda and unleash a new economic golden age through his goals to secure our supply chains, strategically use sanctions, stand up for American workers, ensure the U.S. dollar remains the world reserve currency, reduce wasteful spending, and make President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act permanent. 

Born and raised in South Carolina Low Country with firsthand experience of what it means for a family to struggle to make ends meet, and the determination and grit that resulted, Scott will be a transformative leader at the Department of Treasury.

Highlights from Senator Marshall’s Remarks Include: 

“Many of us share the same goal that we want Americans to be prosperous. We want them to be able to live their American dream. We disagree how to get there, oftentimes, but we all had the same goal: that we want Americans to be prosperous. Mr. Bessent, welcome and congratulations on your nomination.” 

“I think it could be said that rural America, in many ways, is President Trump’s base. Of the 77 million people that voted for President Trump, a lot of them came from rural America… and no one has suffered more these last four years than rural America has… What can we do to help Main Street, to help small businesses and to help rural America?” 

“Now everyone knows that you’re a financial wizard, that you’ve been successful on Wall Street, but I just want to understand your commitment to small town America. You’re from a small town. I think you understand agriculture from our conversations and even some background in community banks. How important are community banks to those small towns, and what is your commitment to rural America?” 

“45Z is a tax credit…it would really help rural America in the standpoint that we help take some of our feedstocks, whether it’s soybeans or corn, and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel. I think it’s going to lead to cleaner air for all of us, but it’s certainly very important to rural America. And just would ask that you would look into it, but what we can’t do is let China benefit from it. I really think any tax credit we have should not impact foreign entities.” 

“On the Trump tax cuts and how important it is to make them permanent… I can tell you that families back in Kansas were able to keep about $1,000 a month in their pocket after the Trump tax cuts took effect, and I think that would be going forward. So if we lost it, if we lost these Trump tax cuts, then I would assume that those same families would be giving the federal government another $1,000 so this, this issue, to me, is vitally important to rural America.”

This legislation would end the Biden-Harris Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) blatant overreach by terminating its unauthorized “Direct File” tax filing program. By further barring the agency from unlawfully preparing taxpayer returns without congressional approval, the bill would establish crucial safeguards to prevent future attempts to sidestep Congress. 

“The IRS—without any authorization from Congress—is spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to create and operate a program that already exists in a more efficient form in the private sector,”  said Senator Marshall.  “As our nation faces a crippling national debt crisis, it’s imperative we end wasteful, costly, and redundant programs like The Direct File initiative.” 

“By taking on the role of both tax preparer and tax auditor, the IRS created an undeniable conflict of interest when it circumvented Congress to establish the Direct File program,”  said Senator Blackburn  . “This legislation would right this wrong by stopping the IRS from preparing tax returns without explicit legislative approval and ending this wasteful and misguided program.”

10:54:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Senator Marshall, M.D., the Chair of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Caucus, and his colleagues released the following statements after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially banned Red No. 3 from foods, dietary supplements and ingested medicines. 

The MAHA Caucus is a bicameral initiative that is focused on working with the Trump Administration to focus on nutrition, and access to affordable, high-quality- nutrient-dense foods and primary care. Members of the caucus look forward to addressing the root causes of chronic diseases and creating a healthier, stronger nation with President Trump and HHS nominee RFK Jr. 

“The FDA has no excuse for waiting over 30 years to ban red dye. It took President Trump and RFK Jr. sounding the alarm to prompt the FDA to take action. With President Trump back in the White House and MAHA as a priority, we will make top down reforms to the FDA, prioritizing transparency and expediency when it comes to Americans’ health,”  Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. said. 

“Last month, I demanded answers from FDA officials on why Red Dye No. 3 is banned in cosmetics while being allowed in our foods. Glad to see the FDA finally use some common sense. I will keep working with Robert F. Kennedy and the MAHA Caucus to Make America Healthy Again,”  Senator Tommy Tuberville said. 

“As a member of the MAHA Caucus, and Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, my top priority is making sure Americans have the best information available to keep themselves safe and healthy, and I’m glad to see this positive step. I look forward to working with President Trump, his nominee for HHS Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and my colleagues on the caucus to bring more transparency and information to the federal government as we Make America Healthy Again,”  Senator Rick Scott said. 

“America is sicker than ever, and President Trump has made it a priority to address America’s chronic disease epidemic,” said Lummis. I am partnering with Dr. Roger Marshall to make America healthy again and hold the federal agencies who have failed the American people accountable,”  Senator Cynthia Lummis said. 

“I’m pleased to see the FDA stand up to pressure from food companies and ban a substance that harms the public, especially our children. We must confirm RFK Jr. so we can expose any harmful practices in the food and drug industry and hold our federal health agencies accountable,”  Senator Ron Johnson said. 

“I applaud the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to ban Red No. 3 from American food products by 2027; however, this ruling is 30 years too late,”  House of Representatives, Make America Healthy Again  (MAHA)  Caucus Co-Chair, John Joyce, M.D. said.  “Thirty years ago, once Red. No. 3 was linked to cause cancer, it was banned from cosmetic products. The delay in implementing a similar ban for food products shows the need for change at the FDA, a change that I am confident President Trump will bring in the months ahead.” 

“Red dye number three was banned for use in cosmetics over thirty years ago for being linked to causing cancer in animal test subjects, but the FDA has only now decided to take action to prevent it being used in foods or drugs. This is exactly what the MAHA movement is working towards—advancing a national conversation and review of federal policies to take a good look at what is in Americans’ foods that could affect their wellbeing and address a real public health emergency. With declining life expectancy, rising incidences of chronic diseases, and high rates of obesity, we must act now. I look forward to working with the MAHA Caucus in collaboration with the incoming Trump administration to improve Americans’ health,”  House of Representatives, Make America Healthy Again  (MAHA)  Caucus Co-Chair,  Lloyd Smucker said. 

“The decision by the FDA to ban Red Dye 3 is a critical and long-overdue step toward protecting Americans. It’s past time that we prioritize the well-being of our families over harmful chemicals in our food and products. The Make America Healthy Again Caucus will continue to fight for safer, healthier options for all. This is just the beginning—we will keep pushing for a healthier America,”  Congressman Brian Babin, D.D.S. said. 

“Food is medicine, and the incoming Trump-Vance Administration is already showing leadership by calling attention to cancer-causing food dyes. Banning Red No. 3 is a commonsense move that should have been made decades ago. This is just the start of four great years of Making America Healthy Again,”  Rep. Buddy Carter said. 

“President Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, and we are already seeing the effects of his election,”  Congressman Nick Langworthy said.  “The FDA could have taken action sooner, but they knew that under the leadership of President Trump and his focus to Make America Healthy Again that actions like this were imminent. I welcome this move by the FDA and I can’t wait to continue to work with the Make America Healthy Again caucus to pass legislation to help make our country and communities healthy again.” 

“The FDA’s recent ban of Red No. 3 is a great first step in making America healthy again. I look forward to seeing what President Trump and RFK Jr. will do to further the MAHA movement,”  Rep. William Timmons said. 

“If a substance isn’t safe to put on your skin due to its carcinogenic effects, it’s probably not safe to consume. Until now, the FDA has simply looked the other way and allowed our children to eat food with Red Dye 3 in it. While it’s a couple of decades too late, I’m pleased to see the FDA taking their lead from President-elect Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to set the stage for the next administration’s healthcare priorities. It’s time to Make America Healthy Again,”  Rep. Vern Buchanan said. 

BACKGROUND: 

  * Red Dye No. 3 is a petroleum-based additive used to give food and drugs a bright cherry-red color. 
  * In 1990, the FDA banned its use in cosmetics and topical drugs due to evidence it caused cancer in male laboratory rats. 
  * Despite this, the FDA allowed its continued use in food and ingested drugs in the United States. 
  * By January 2027 food manufacturers must remove Red Dye No. 3 from their products. 
  * The dye is already banned in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

10:54:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. penned an  op-ed  in the  Washington Examiner  highlighting how President Trump’s Secretary of Treasury nominee, Scott Bessent, will deliver economic opportunity for all Americans. Marshall’s op-ed articulated why he is the right man at the right time for the job. 

As a newly appointed member of the Senate Finance Committee, Marshall will vote in support of Bessent’s nomination for Treasury today’s committee’s hearing. Senator Marshall’s op-ed highlights Bessent’s experience and commonsense policies that will restore hope and prosperity for future generations.

Highlights from Senator Marshall’s op-ed include: 

“America stands at a critical crossroads. After years of crippling inflation, stagnant wages, and an economy weighed down by failed economic policies, families across the nation are struggling to make ends meet. Inflation has affected everyone, driving prices for everyday essentials such as gas, groceries, rent, and mortgages to historic highs, eliminating the American dream for millions. The message we received on Nov. 5 couldn’t be clearer: It’s time for bold leadership to turn our economy around.” 

“For such a time as this, President-elect Donald Trump has chosen a strong leader for secretary of treasury with the nomination of Scott Bessent.” 

“Their plan is rooted in commonsense policies. First, renewing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: The Trump TCJA provided critical relief to families and businesses, and Bessent plans to extend these benefits while introducing new measures to further stimulate economic growth.” 

“Second, revitalizing American manufacturing: Pro-growth regulatory reforms, expanded energy production, and support for domestic industries will position America as the global leader in innovation and production.” 

“Third, making deals that give America the upper hand: For decades, unbalanced trade policies have gutted American industries and left workers vulnerable. Bessent will champion policies that protect American jobs and ensure fair competition in global markets.” 

“Bessent has shown a dedication to rooting out waste and ensuring taxpayer dollars are used wisely; running the federal government like a business is just the forward-thinking we need as our country faces a historic debt crisis. His commitment to streamlining the federal government, saving billions, and enhancing government accountability along with the leaders of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency will be critical in his role.” 

“America needs a leader who understands the challenges of everyday families and has the expertise to implement real solutions. Scott Bessent is that leader. With his proven track record, vision for economic growth, and unwavering commitment to American workers, Bessent is ready to partner with Trump to deliver the change our nation desperately needs.”

10:54:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to re-introduce legislation to repeal the Biden administration’s Natural Gas Tax in the  Inflation Reduction Act.  Sen. Tuberville has fought this burdensome regulation from the Biden administration since the beginning and  joined  Sen. Cruz in May 2024 when this legislation was first introduced. This bill eliminates a methane emissions charge that would impose fees or taxes on energy companies, raising costs for American taxpayers. 

“The Biden administration has once again prioritized woke climate activists over the American people,”  said Sen. Tuberville. “  Since day one in office, Joe Biden has waged war on American energy – driving up costs and sending American jobs overseas. The last thing Americans need right now are higher taxes and more government red tape. I am proud to join this legislation, which puts American families first and works toward American energy independence.” 

“Democratic policies have forced Americans to endure historic inflation and economic pain, and have jeopardized American energy independence and national security,”  said Sen. Cruz.  “It’s time to unleash American energy. The 2024 election was a mandate for new policies. My legislation eliminates what would be a crippling tax. I urge my colleagues to expeditiously take up and pass my legislation.” 

U.S. Senators Tuberville and Cruz were joined by U.S. Senators Katie Britt (R-AL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) in introducing the legislation. 

The legislation is supported by the US Oil & Gas Association (USOGA), American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), American Petroleum Institute (API), National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA), Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, Texas Independent & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO), and Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF).

10:54:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: “  This is a much-needed piece of legislation that will help small businesses succeed, not suffocate  .” 

WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) penned an  op-ed  in the  Washington Examiner  about his bill, the  Repealing Big Brother Overreach Act  , or S. 100. This legislation will repeal the disastrous  Corporate Transparency Act  (CTA) and protect small business owners from intrusive government overreach. In the piece, Sen. Tuberville talks about how small businesses have been crushed the last four years by the Biden Administration’s disastrous economic policies and how the threat of fines and jail time for noncompliance with the CTA only makes matters worse. 

Read excerpts of the piece below or  here  . 

“  The CTA requires people with  ‘  substantial control  ’  over a company, an equity position of 25% or greater, to disclose personal data to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. People with a CTA filing obligation must report their name, date of birth, address, and a scan of their government-issued photo ID to the Treasury Department. Any time this information changes, updated information must be submitted to FinCEN’s database within 30 days. 

As if these new requirements aren’t daunting enough for small business owners, those who fail to comply with the law can face up to $10,000 in fines and up to two years in prison. The CTA’s provisions originally required business owners to file by Jan. 1. An injunction is blocking the law from taking effect, but there is no telling how long the injunction will hold. 

America’s small business owners have been forced to storm a rocky economy under an administration that has been hostile to them for four years. Now, debilitating fines and jail time are on the horizon. It is unacceptable that small business owners need to overcome laws such as this in America today. It’s big government overreach at its worst  . 

That is why, this week, I reintroduced my bill, the Repealing Big Brother Overreach Act, to overturn the CTA in its entirety. I am proud to be joined in this effort by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH), who is filing a companion bill in the House of Representatives. This is a much-needed piece of legislation that will help small businesses succeed, not suffocate. It will stop Big Brother from bearing down on them, threatening to throw them in prison for noncompliance. […] 

As America enters a new golden age with the election of President-elect Donald Trump to his second term, we need to unleash the power of small businesses in the country. Small businesses are the bedrock of the American dream. I am calling on my Senate colleagues to support my legislation so we can get the federal government off the backs of business owners and let them flourish. Because when they flourish, America flourishes.  ”

10:54:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: “It is dangerous and deeply concerning that our Secretary of Defense left the United States vulnerable when he was completely out of commission twice—and didn’t feel the need to tell his boss either time.” 

WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is demanding accountability from the Biden administration after it was  revealed  in an Inspector General (IG) report earlier this week that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin  failed  to follow the proper chain of command twice during two hospitalizations in 2023 and 2024. Senator Tuberville sounded the alarm about the possible national security lapses as a direct result of Secretary Austin’s failure to follow protocol earlier this week in a  video  . 

“I just read an extremely disturbing IG report. In December 2023, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was hospitalized and failed to follow the law by notifying the White House or Congress,”  said Senator Tuberville.  “Similarly, his Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks also refused to follow protocol and report the transfer of authority. Now, the just released Inspector General’s report reveals that this didn’t just happen once. Secretary Austin did the same thing again five months later. And he hid it from everyone. Look, I get it. People get sick, it happens to all of us. And I sincerely hope Secretary Austin is healthy. But it is dangerous and deeply concerning that our Secretary of Defense left the United States vulnerable when he was completely out of commission twice—and didn’t feel the need to tell his boss either time. 

Thanks to Joe Biden, we have wars all over the world. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am deeply disturbed to learn that we have had two significant lapses in the chain of command that have left our country vulnerable. Just as you’d expect, there will be zero accountability from Biden or his administration. Thankfully, change is coming. In three days, President Donald J. Trump will be sworn in as our 47th President, and the Senate will swiftly confirm Pete Hegseth as our next Secretary of Defense. We will have accountability and strength in the Pentagon once again. And it can’t come soon enough.” 

Senator Tuberville also joined Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in sending a  letter  this week to President Biden calling for transparency about how this happened twice. In the letter, the senators note that in two separate instances Secretary of Defense Austin’s failure to secure his chain of command and inform Congress could have led to a national security catastrophe. 

“  For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress or in your administration knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary…At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan,”  the senators wrote.  “The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football…It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation.” 

The senators add that accountability for Secretary Austin is long overdue. 

“Secretary Austin must be held accountable for betraying his office, betraying the trust of the American people, violating the FVRA multiple times, and fumbling the nuclear football…The American people are sick of impunity for those at the top of our military – a blight that has become a defining feature of our Department of Defense,”  the senators wrote.  “In your last week in office, you must do the right thing and hold Secretary Austin accountable for his multiple failures to comply with the law and notify Congress of vacancies in his office.” 

In January 2024, after Sec. Austin’s first hospitalization, Senators Tuberville and Wicker, along with their SASC Republican colleagues,  sent  a letter to Sec. Austin posing many questions about his first incapacitation that would only be addressed in the Inspector General report more than a year later. 

Read the full letter text below, or read it  here  . 

President Joseph R. Biden 

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 

Washington, DC 20500 

Dear Mr. President, 

Yesterday the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DOD OIG) released its report on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s multi-day absence in December 2023, and January 2024 based on his medical incapacitation. The report found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks failed to notify Congress, the White House, the Comptroller General, and key officials within the Department of Defense that Secretary Austin was incapacitated. The report confirmed what we already knew – these failures to notify were clear violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), a law that is rooted in the Constitutional principle that the people control their government. Alarmingly, the OIG report not only found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary Hicks violated the FVRA in December 2023 and January 2024, but they also violated it on two occasions in June 2024. These two additional violations were wholly unknown to Congress and demonstrate an utter disregard for oversight and accountability that should be completely unacceptable in the Department of Defense. 

For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary. In fact, for several days in December and January, not even Deputy Secretary Hicks knew that she was the acting Secretary. Once she found out, she, too, failed to notify Congress and the White House as required by law. At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan. The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football, and the entire American nuclear enterprise was left idling. 

It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation. While we applaud the OIG for its thorough and objective report, it is clear that political officers within the DOD obstructed and delayed the OIG’s work until it had no choice but to release the report five days before you and Secretary Austin are to leave office. 

There must be accountability for Secretary Austin’s irresponsible behavior, your administration’s multiple violations of the FVRA, and the mishandling of the nuclear football. Certainly, if a uniformed officer had done only one of these things he or she would be facing the end of their career. Sadly, those in charge seem to believe that the same standards do not apply to them. The American people will no longer accept a lack of accountability for the failures of our senior military leaders, whether civilian or uniformed. 

In your last week in office, you must do the right thing and hold Secretary Austin accountable for his multiple failures to comply with the law and notify Congress of vacancies in his office. 

Sincerely, 

Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, HELP, and Aging Committees.

10:54:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), founding member of the Senate Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Caucus, released a statement after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially banned Red No. 3 from foods, dietary supplements and ingested medicines. This ban follows efforts from Sen. Tuberville during a Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing in December 2024 when he  pressed  top FDA officials on the long-term effects of using harmful chemicals in the American food and beverage industry. 

“Last month, I demanded answers from FDA officials on why Red Dye No. 3 is banned in cosmetics while being allowed in our foods. Glad to see the FDA finally use some common sense. I will keep working with Robert F. Kennedy and the MAHA Caucus to Make America Healthy Again,”  said Sen. Tuberville. 

The MAHA Caucus is a bicameral initiative that is focused on working with the Trump Administration to focus on nutrition, and access to affordable, high-quality-nutrient-dense foods and primary care. Members of the caucus look forward to addressing the root causes of chronic diseases and creating a healthier, stronger nation with President Trump and HHS nominee RFK Jr.

WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) joined “National Report” on Newsmax to discuss the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,  legislation they introduced to keep biological males from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  by a vote of 218-206 earlier this week, with two House Democrats voting in support. 

Excerpts from the interview can be found below, and the full interview can be viewed on  Rumble  or  YouTube  . 

ON SIGNIFICANCE OF TITLE IX: 

GLASGOW:  “Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville is leading this bill, and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis is among the two dozen cosponsors of the bill. Senators, thank you for your time. Obviously, a very important topic, but for many they’re questioning why would you have to pass legislation for something as common sense as this. Title IX protections already in place, yet here we are. Senator Lummis, I’ll let you take that.” 

LUMMIS:  “Coach Tuberville and I were just talking about that before we got on the air. It’s only common sense that we preserve women’s sports for biological women. It’s dangerous to have men in the locker room—not to mention extremely uncomfortable—and it’s ridiculous to put the superior physiology that men enjoy in competition with women. It’s just common sense to have women’s sports that are just for women.” 

RECHENBERG:  “Indeed. And so much so that it passed in the House with support from Republicans—a couple of Democrats—but not everyone was happy about it. This is a sound bite from New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Let’s listen together.” 

[…] 

“And again, she was looping in Republicans with that idea. Senator Tuberville, would you like to respond to that?” 

TUBERVILLE:  “Well, first of all, there’s no common sense here as Senator Lummis says. I started coaching back years ago when Title IX started, and it gave many opportunities to young girls and women to enhance their future. It gave them an opportunity—the same as boys had, and you learn a lot from sports. Now, the Democratic party wants to tear it down. They have yet to figure out why they lost November the 5  th  —well, I tell you why they lost: a major part of it was because they have lost their ever-loving mind. When they’re allowing boys or men to shower with girls, to dress with girls, and to participate when it is very unsafe. It’s not going to happen. I’ve got my first grandchild, Rosie Grace, and I promise you one thing: she’s not going to participate in that, but she’s going to have an opportunity to participate in sports because we’re going to beat back these Democrats on this nonsensical nonsense that they keep pushing, and whatever this lady is—Cortez—she has no business even talking because they have tried to destroy gender ever since she’s been into office.” 

GLASGOW:  “Senator Lummis, I’ll have you respond to that as well. I mean AOC used some harsh words there—specifically calling those that supported ‘a bigot.’ Do you see yourself as that?” 

LUMMIS:  “Well of course not. The University of Wyoming volleyball team was put up against a team from California that had a trans person on the team who can spike the ball 80 miles an hour. That can cause a concussion to a girl. For safety reasons, we need to make sure that boys are competing as boys, men are competing as men, and women have their space to compete with other women. So, heaven forbid, I am not a bigot. In fact, I am angry. As someone who went to high school before Title IX, did not have opportunities to play competitive sports—I see what Title IX has done for my daughter and generations after her. It’s made an opportunity for women to learn competition, hard work, discipline, getting up early, losing and staying with it. The advantages of sports, competitive sports, for everyone builds character, and as someone who did not get to participate in that because I was a pre-Title IX girl, I’m so happy that Title IX exists. I want to protect Title IX for the very people that it was intended to protect and that’s biological girls and women.” 

RECHENBERG:  “Thank you for sharing that. And of course, your efforts don’t go unnoticed, especially for Rosie Grace as she begins to grow up and she’ll play in sports potentially, Senator. We wish her the best, and your family as well.” 

ON PETE HEGSETH: 

RECHENBERG:  “Can we pivot and talk about what else is happening on the hill? Those are the confirmation hearings for Donald Trump, President-elect. Pete Hegseth started it off this week. Many Democratic colleagues of yours grilled him pretty harshly. We’ve got some of those moments—we’ll play it for you now.” 

[…] 

“Senator Tuberville, what did you think of those questions and do you believe Pete Hegseth should be confirmed?” 

TUBERVILLE:  “Well, first of all, their game plan was obvious: seek and destroy. They came in to destroy the personal life—not the military, but the personal life—of Pete Hegseth. He’s perfect for the job. He stood up to them. He did an excellent job of coming back on everything that they threw at him. But again, at the end of the day, you have to look at somebody that’s going to take a job like this. They kept going after him, ‘You’ve never been around this many people, or had to control three million people or all these employees.’ Nobody has. My gosh—I mean these people have lost their minds. So, he did a great job. He’s going to be a great Secretary of Defense—he won over a lot a lot of people across this country, and he’s got a lot of people behind him that are either veterans or former military people or present military people, and he’s a great age because he’s young, energetic, and he can communicate with all these young people that we need to recruit.” 

GLASGOW:  “Yeah. Senator Lummis, are you a ‘yes’ on Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense?” 

LUMMIS:  “I am. We have a recruitment problem. We need to inspire young men and women to join our military and Pete Hegseth is one of the best spokespeople in the whole country for inspiring young men and women to serve our country in that manner.” 

RECHENBERG:  “Alright. We’ll be watching for the votes that’ll be coming in soon. Of course, the President-elect has to be sworn in again with the inauguration on Monday. Thank you both for joining us this morning. It’s been such a pleasure to speak with you—Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis.”

10:54:55 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:54:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) in introducing the  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025  . The legislation requires the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) to hold two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years—resulting in 20 total lease sales. 

“For the last four years, the Biden administration has waged war on American energy. This intentional attack has depleted our domestic energy supply and made us dependent on foreign adversaries. Offshore energy development in the Gulf of Mexico is essential to our nation’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, offering immense economic, national security, and environmental advantages. We need to fully tap into our abundant energy resources, including in the Gulf. I’m proud to join Senator Cassidy in this effort, and will continue working with the Trump administration to restore America’s energy independence,”  said Sen. Tuberville 

U.S. Senators Tuberville and Cassidy are joined by U.S. Senators Katie Britt (R-AL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) in cosponsoring the legislation. 

The legislation is endorsed by the American Petroleum Institute (API), National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA), Gulf Energy Alliance (GEA), and Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA). 

Read full text of the legislation  here  . 

BACKGROUND: 

The current five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drafted under the Biden-Harris administration only suggests three lease sales over five years. Given that 2024 was the first year without an offshore lease sale in more than 50 years, it is important to provide long-term leasing certainty that companies can rely on. 

In addition to mandating sales, the bill also defines acreage, stipulates lease terms and conditions, defines which previously finalized environmental reviews will apply to the sales, and ensures that both issued leases and drilling permit applications are not either invalidated, remanded, or delayed as a result of civil litigation. The bill also codifies President Trump’s 2020 memorandum to withdraw the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from leasing for the duration of the legislation. 

The  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025  : 

  * Mandates two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years; 
  * Provides certainty to offshore energy producers to continue investing in the United States; and 
  * Codifies President Trump’s 2020 memorandum on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. 



Sen. Tuberville  cosponsored  the  Offshore Energy Act of 2023  last Congress.

10:54:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) spoke on the Senate floor about the national nightmare Americans have endured the last four years under the Biden administration. In his speech, Sen. Tuberville addressed the many concerns Americans are now facing as a result, including illegal immigration, higher costs of living, and a far more dangerous world. To right the ship, Sen. Tuberville emphasized the need to answer the call of the American people, confirm President Trump’s nominees, and get to work implementing the America First agenda. 

Read Senator Tuberville’s remarks below or watch on  YouTube  or  Rumble  . 

“Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, the last 4 years have been nothing short of a national nightmare. The run-up to the nightmare began in 2020. After fending off a ridiculous impeachment attempt in the early months of 2020, President Trump was riding high. 

The economy was booming. Under President Trump, we saw record levels of low unemployment for all Americans, especially among black and Hispanic Americans. Inflation, which is ultimately a tax on the paychecks of hardworking Americans, was also at record lows. 

We had the most secure border in history. Dangerous terrorists, cartel members, and human traffickers weren’t flooding into our country. Americans’ jobs were more secure because they didn’t have to compete with millions of foreigners who have entered the country the last 4 years trying to steal their jobs. The cost of buying a home was also cheaper as a result. 

Under President Trump, we were energy independent. This made the cost of living more affordable for all Americans. We were able to power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable—and abundant—energy. 

And that’s just a few of the domestic successes that Americans were benefitting from under President Trump. 

On the global stage, we finally had stability after decades of foreign wars. Under President Trump, there were no new wars. We were respected around the world and feared by our adversaries. Russia didn’t dare invade Ukraine when President Trump was in office. NATO countries were told to pay up—pay your bills. China wasn’t imposing its will in the South China Sea, or across the world. China was contained and its influence was diminishing. Under President Trump, the Abraham Accords were signed, bringing peace to the Middle East. As we’ve seen the last few years, achieving peace in the Middle East was no easy feat.But President Trump achieved it, and he did it quickly. The United States and the world were in harmony. 

The Left couldn’t stand these many successes that the President Trump Administration was achieving at home and abroad. So, they pulled out all the stops to take him down. That’s when the deep state bureaucrats and globalist organizations worked together to intensify the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the George Floyd riots erupted and destroyed cities across our country. Liberal DAs and politicians didn’t do anything to stop it. It was absolute anarchy – total chaos orchestrated by left-wing politicians, the media, and Antifa thugs. Meanwhile the media tried to manufacture a scandal because President Trump held up a Bible in front of a historic church—while the rioters burned the city of D.C., all this was ignored. 

It was all a ploy to take down President Trump and tarnish his legacy. Before the plot to take out the President was in full swing, we saw America achieving heights we had never ever seen before. 

And for a moment, the left thought they’d bested Trump with the COVID sham and the Floyd riots—and ultimately by rigging the election. But after controlling Biden by hiding him in the basement and then installing him as President, the Democrats were like a dog who finally caught the car. Once the Democrats took the White House, they quickly realized they didn’t know how to run the country. 

It’s not quite like running a struggle session in Berkeley—in a Berkely classroom—or leading an HR call for a woke corporation. 

The Democrats had 4 years to show the country they could govern more effectively than President Trump. But what have they done? What’s one thing they’ve done to make our country better? I can’t think of one policy, one law, or directive that actually benefitted the American people. 

From day one, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris invited foreigners to illegally enter our country. They weren’t shy. Joe Biden told foreigners to ‘surge the border’ and ‘you should all come’ 

While the administration opened the border, they shut down the Keystone Pipeline—making Americans pay more for groceries and gas. 

The Biden Administration engaged in a culture war domestically, embracing far-left ideas about sexuality, gender, and race. We’ve been told repeatedly, repeatedly over the past 4 years that men can get pregnant. And the Democrats didn’t just push woke ideology on adults. They forced it on children in their classrooms and on social media. 

They’ve supported biological men competing in women’s sports. They are perfectly okay with men sharing locker rooms and showering with girls. The Biden administration published a rule that would destroy Title IX, which was created to protect women and girls. All in the name of ‘gender equity.’ 

Not only did the Democrats wage war on American culture, they weaponized our justice system, going after President Trump, conservatives, and anyone who dare to oppose their agenda. Just look at how they went after the January 6 protestors, pro-lifers with the FACE Act, parents at school boards, and the dozens of illegal actions they took against President Trump. 

The Biden administration—with the help of congressional Democrats—passed a bunch of bills with names that sound good, but actually they harmed many Americans. Take the ‘Inflation Reduction Act’, for example. One of their prized bills that they passed in the last few years. It was a legal way to launder money to Blue States to bail them out, while Red States were hung out to dry. It pumped money we don’t have into the economy, causing the runaway inflation we’re dealing with today. 

This administration was also weak on the world stage, appeasing every interest but the interests of the American people. This administration was committed to cozying up to Iran by reinstating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. As if the world wasn’t already a dangerous place, why would President Biden’s administration agree to help Iran improve their nuclear facilities? This administration bent over backwards for NATO – handing over billions of hard-earned American taxpayer dollars with no plan on ending the war in Ukraine. It executed a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that left 13 servicemembers dead, with many others severely wounded. 

This administration was basically asleep at the wheel. Who was running the country? Well, it wasn’t Joe Biden. It was clear from the 2020 campaign that he didn’t have the mental capability to be President. To make matters worse, he spent 570 days, 40% of his presidency, on vacation. Instead, the White House was run by a committee of left-wing staffers and interests, special interests who ultimately ran the country into the ground. 

And the media and Democrats were complicit. It’s truly shameful what they have done to this country in the last 4 years. 

But now we are finally turning the page. We are entering a new Golden Age in America with President Trump’s return to the White House. And this is our last chance at righting the ship the Left has steered so far off course. 

President Trump will return our country to the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will return to the Judeo-Christian beliefs and principles of the West that made our Nation so great. 

And how should the Senate help return our country to these principles? We need to confirm every single one of President Trump’s nominees as quickly as possible. We don’t have time to drag our feet on any of these nominees. The Democrats never once attempted to block President Biden’s cabinet nominees. Zero Senate Democrats voted against any one of his picks—zero. President Trump needs to be able to exercise the full power and authority of his office as soon as he is sworn in, and that requires confirming his cabinet picks. 

It will also require the issuing of Executive Orders to undo anything President Biden has done and taking congressional action to put these policies in place. Expect a flurry of Executive Orders, a new offensive idea to rebuild our broken country. Expect Executive Orders on the border, on unleashing American energy, and getting DEI out of our government and out of the lives of the American people. 

We also need to get behind President Trump on passing one reconciliation bill that will secure our border, reignite our energy independence, and cut taxes so the American economy can boom again. 

And on the global stage, the Senate needs to get behind President Trump pressuring NATO, all the NATO countries to pay their fair share. No more military handouts for European countries. And no more lighting taxpayer dollars on fire on behalf of Ukraine. It’s time to get this war over with. The Senate needs to support President Trump and exert maximum pressure on Iran and other terrorist organizations wreaking havoc on the middle east and the West. 

We also need to join President Trump’s commitment on shrinking the federal government through strong congressional action. We will do this by working closely with the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE. We need to shrink the government, cutting the ridiculous regulations that are crushing American small businesses. 

And finally, we need to focus on accountability. We need to hold people accountable for the damage that has been done to our country. We need to support the pardon of January 6 protestors who were wrongly prosecuted and horribly treated by our justice system. We need to step up and fight for pro-life, pro-life protestors who were persecuted by this administration under the FACE Act. We need to open investigations into the DOJ Civil Rights and National Security Divisions. And that starts with confirming Kash Patel and Pam Bondi to the posts where President Trump needs them and needs them in a hurry. 

We need to be aggressive in these pursuits. Senate Republicans need to demonstrate courage, and will, and resolve, like President Trump showed on the campaign trail. Are we willing to take a bullet for this country like President Trump did? Are we willing to take on the fake news media who will try to undermine his everyday agenda? 

The job ahead of us won’t be easy. The economy is in bad shape. Jobs numbers are down and inflation sky high. Our enemies are on the move abroad and in the interior of our country. But the American people chose President Trump and Republicans for such a time like this. They gave us a mandate to deliver them from the past four years of hell that this administration has caused. 

But now, it’s a new day in America. The nightmare is almost over. And in a few more days, the sun will rise on America. Greatness awaits us if we answer the call of the American people. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor.”

10:54:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) in introducing legislation to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs’ authority to hold poor-performing employees accountable. 

In 2017, Congress passed the  VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act  with overwhelming bipartisan support in response to the nationwide VA access crisis that exposed a toxic workforce culture at VA that negatively impacted veterans’ care. Passage of this legislation gave VA leaders the ability to break through bureaucratic obstacles to discipline or fire poor-performing employees, providing VA employees a healthier workplace and increasing veterans’ trust in VA. The  Restore VA Accountability Act  addresses questionable decisions from the Federal Circuit, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Merit Systems Protection Board that rendered the authority in the  VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act  unusable for most of the VA workforce. 

“Taking care of our veterans is a sacred duty,”  said Sen. Tuberville.  “Veterans should have the best medical care in this country, but at times they have had some of the worst. Veterans shouldn’t be waiting in excruciatingly long lines because the VA’s priorities are misplaced. This legislation restores the VA Accountability Act to its full strength by cutting bureaucratic red tape to allow VA leaders to discipline employees who aren’t doing their jobs.” 

In 2023, Sen. Tuberville wrote an  op-ed  about his support for the  VA Accountability Act  to create transparency at the VA. 

U.S. Representative Mike Bost (R-IL-12) led the effort in the U.S. House of Representatives and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, America’s Warrior Partnership, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, National Guard Association of the United States endorsed the legislation. 

Joining U.S. Senators Tuberville and Moran are U.S. Senators Jim Banks (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Jim Risch (R-ID), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) in cosponsoring the legislation.

Washington, D.C.  – Today, during a Senate Banking committee hearing on the nomination of Scott Turner to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) pushed for key commitments from Turner to support of HUD’s budget for key housing programs that lower housing costs by helping Georgians afford rent and homeownership. Senator Reverend Warnock also pushed Turner to commit to vigorously enforce the nation’s fair housing laws and use HUD’s tools and authorities to crack down on appraisal bias to improve the increasing racial homeownership gap. 

“Unfortunately, during the first Trump Administration, President-elect Trump repeatedly proposed to slash HUD’s budget–including cuts and the full elimination of key HUD programs that help people afford rent and realize the dream of homeownership, which you and I agree is so important. If enacted, these cuts would raise housing costs for millions of families. Last time, Congress stepped in year after year to save many of these programs. This time I’m not so sure that we’ll be able to do it,”  said Senator Reverend Warnock. 

As one of twelve brothers and sisters growing up in public housing in Savannah, Senator Warnock is committed to combating the affordable housing crisis and helping more Americans achieve the dream of homeownership and build generational wealth. 

“The racial homeownership gap has been widening over the last few years. Yesterday we celebrated Dr. King’s actual birthday, Monday is the holiday. And folks often talk about those two key civil rights bills: the accommodations law in ‘64, voting rights law in ‘65. We don’t talk enough about Fair Housing. That is a victory of Dr. King’s. That law was signed into law just a few days after his assassination, but that is a result of his work. The first Trump Administration sought to weaken and even rescind landmark fair housing laws–laws pushed through by Dr. King. If confirmed, you would be responsible for enforcing these fair housing laws,”  said Senator Reverend Warnock. 

If confirmed, Turner would take over America’s largest housing agency amid an affordable housing crisis afflicting Georgia and the nation. There is far more demand for housing than supply, especially in Georgia. As a result, many hard-working Georgians are paying significant amount of their income on rent, sometimes sacrificing food or medication, while the middle class is having a harder time buying a home. During Donald Trump’s first term, the White House repeatedly proposed steep cuts to HUD’s budget, which were often rejected by Congress. As a member of the Senate committee overseeing federal housing policies, Senator Warnock will be vigilant in defending programs that help Georgians and Americans afford rent and homeownership. 

Watch the Senator’s full remarks  HERE  . 

See below a transcript of key exchanges between Senator Warnock and HUD nominee Scott Turner (remarks have been lightly edited for clarity): 

Senator Reverend Warnock (SRW): “I often tell people that I am a product of good public policy. I’ve worked hard, but I wouldn’t be sitting where I am without some help, some ladders, good public policy. I grew up in public housing, and I understand the security and dignity that housing provides children and families. Mr. Turner, do you believe homeownership provides dignity, security, and access to generational wealth?” 

Scott Turner (ST): “I do.” 

SRW: “Thank you so much. I agree. Unfortunately, during the first Trump Administration, President-elect Trump repeatedly proposed to slash HUD’s budget–including cuts and the full elimination of key HUD programs that help people afford rent and realize the dream of homeownership, which you and I agree is so important. If enacted, these cuts would raise housing costs for millions of families. Last time, Congress stepped in year after year to save many of these programs. This time I’m not so sure that we’ll be able to do it. Mr. Turner, if confirmed, will you commit to being a voice in the administration against severe cuts to HUD’s budget at a challenging time, including programs that help people afford rent and homeownership?” 

ST: “My job and my goal, if confirmed by the committee, is to maximize that budget to meet the needs of the American people and to carry forth the programs at HUD. I do commit that to you.” 

SRW: “Will you be a voice to hold the line to protect programs that provide the dignity of homeownership and make rent affordable for working class people?” 

ST: “I do commit to having those conversations with the president and with and with Congress.” 

SRW: “The racial homeownership gap has been widening over the last few years. Yesterday we celebrated Dr. King’s actual birthday, Monday is the holiday. And folks often talk about those two key civil rights bills: the accommodations law in ‘64, voting rights law in ‘65. We don’t talk enough about Fair Housing. That is a victory of Dr. King’s. That law was signed into law just a few days after his assassination, but that is a result of his work. The first Trump Administration sought to weaken and even rescind landmark fair housing laws–laws pushed through by Dr. King. If confirmed, you would be responsible for enforcing these fair housing laws. If confirmed, will you commit to vigorous enforcement of the nation’s fair housing laws? Yes or no?” 

ST: “Yes.” 

SRW: “And would you be a strong voice in the administration in favor of protecting existing fair housing laws from efforts to weaken them or to roll them back?” 

ST: “I do commit to upholding the fair housing laws. Yes sir.” 

SRW: “So one of the overlooked drivers of racial wealth inequality within our housing system is the very well documented pattern of lenders and the appraisal market persistently assessing the value of Black and brown homes lower than white homeowners. You and I discussed this a little bit the other day in my office, and my staff sent you some background information and data on appraisal bias. This is real money, hurting real people. In part, at my urging, the Biden Administration took steps to crack down on appraisal bias with HUD leading an interagency effort. If confirmed, will you commit to continue to use HUD’s tools and authorities to crack down on appraisal bias, including by continuing to provide consumers with data to push back on suspected bias?” 

ST: “I do commit to upholding the law as it is on the book against all illegal discrimination.” 

SRW: “Including appraisal bias?” 

ST: “We will continue to look into that and I look forward to working with you on that and become more well studied. Thank you.” 

SRW: “Thank you very much and I hope you will continue HUD’s important work on this matter as we go into this weekend of celebrating Dr. King’s birthday.”

Senator Warnock’s line of questioning highlighted Bessent’s committed to tax cuts for those making millions and billions of dollars a year while working-class Georgians struggle 

Senator Reverend Warnock  : “I think our country is facing structural deficits, however, I think to continue to reduce taxes for the wealthy and letting them avoid taxes based on what they already owe is not going to get us out of that problem” 

ICYMI from NBC:  Warnock spars with Bessent over Trump tax cuts 

Watch Senator Warnock at Thursday’s Treasury Secretary nominee hearing  HERE 

Washington, D.C.  – Today, during a Senate Finance committee hearing on Scott Bessent’s nomination to lead the Department of the Treasury, U.S. Senator Reverend Warnock (D-GA) pressed Bessent on his insistence on preserving tax cuts for the richest Americans while the deficit grows and working-class Georgians struggle. Bessent remained adamant that tax cuts for American millionaires and billionaires continue. 

“I think our country is facing structural deficits, however, I think to continue to reduce taxes for the wealthy and letting them avoid taxes based on what they already owe is not going to get us out of that problem,”  said Senator Reverend Warnock. 

During his line of questioning, Senator Warnock asked if Bessent was committed to preserving tax cuts for ultra-wealthy earners at the expense of lowering the deficit, specifically if he would support continuing to provide tax cuts for those making $400,000, $1 million, $10 million, or $1 billion. At no point did Bessent indicate there was any high level of income which he wouldn’t continue to provide tax cuts for. 

“The largest cuts from extending the Trump tax bill would go to those with the highest income, especially those in the top 1% making more than $1 million a year,”  said Senator Reverend Warnock.  “Do you believe that the wealthiest 1% of Americans deserve or need an additional tax cut?”  Senator Reverend Warnock asked Scott Bessent. 

Senator Warnock has long been a champion for tax cuts, credits, and programs that support working families and fought to make sure the nation’s wealthiest pay their fair share. Senator Warnock fought to secure the Expanded Child Tax Credit as part of the  American Rescue Plan  and has advocated to make the  Expanded CTC permanent  in the effort to slash child poverty in Georgia and across America. 

Watch the Senator’s full remarks and line of questioning  HERE  . 

See below a transcript of key exchanges between Senator Warnock and Secretary of Treasury nominee Scott Bessent: 

Senator Reverend Warnock:  “You talked about high deficits as a national defense problem, and I agree with that. I think we need to be fiscally responsible. We need to work to bring the national debt under control. 

“In 2013, Congress extended the Bush tax cuts for everyone except those making more than $400,000 a year. This bipartisan decision saved the Treasury $600 billion, helping to narrow the deficit. 

“Do you agree that ending the tax cuts for those making more than 400 thousand dollars would help close the deficit and reduce our national debt?” 

Scott Bessent:  “Senator Warnock I do not. 

“I believe you would capture an inordinate amount of small business people, people in that cohort of $400,000 to a million.” 

SRW:  “So you wouldn’t cut it off at $400,000. What about $1 million?” 

SB:  “Again, I believe that these are small business pass-through owners. As I said before, Wall Street has done great, it is time for Main Street to do well and small businesses need to drive what I call the reprivatization away from government spending.” 

SRW:  “I agree that it’s Main Street’s time. I’m from Atlanta so I’ll say Peach Street. What about those making more than $10 million? Would we reduce the deficit by extending those tax cuts for folks making about $10 million?” 

SRW:  “So there is no income level which you would support raising taxes? Is that fair” 

SB:  “There’s no income level that I don’t think we should continue the TCJA [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] as it was.”

Washington, D.C  . – Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) co-sponsored an amendment to strengthen the  Laken Riley Act  . The amendment, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), would preserve the intent of the  Laken Riley Act:  to implement policies that would have prevented Laken Riley’s death while strengthening law enforcement’s ability to keep communities safe from dangerous criminals. 

“Laken Riley should be alive today. This amendment preserves provisions that would have prevented Laken Riley’s death while strengthening law enforcement’s ability to remove heinous criminals like Jose Ibarra from our communities. At the end of the day, bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform is the best way to fix our broken immigration system and keep our families safe. That should always be our north star.” 

The amendment would: 

  * Prioritize removing dangerous criminals from Georgia’s communities, 
  * Require mandatory detention for undocumented noncitizens convicted of a crime resulting in serious bodily injury, burglary, theft, or larceny, 
  * Detain noncitizens who have been arrested or charged with a criminal offense and fail ~~s~~ to appear in court, which would have covered crimes committed by Jose Ibarra and could have prevented the death of Laken Riley, and 
  * Protect children from mandatory detention.

10:55:02 root         DEBUG    Desc: In a new letter to Michael Sload, CEO of KIK Consumer Products, the owner of the lab, the lawmakers requested an update on commitments made by BioLab 

This effort follows two  other  letters  the Senator sent in the wake of the BioLab fire 

Senator Reverend Warnock, lawmakers  : “You and your staff have publicly expressed a desire to “address the needs of impacted area residents and business owners” following that incident. It has been three months since the incident; we request specific information regarding your efforts to do so” 

Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senators Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), and U.S. Congressman Hank Johnson (D-GA-04) pressed for updates into the investigation of the September 29  th  chemical fire at the BioLab-Conyers facility, which impacted families in Rockdale County and across Metro Atlanta. 

The lawmakers launched an inquiry with KIK Consumer Products, which owns the BioLab plant, urging the company to strengthen transparency around any public health impacts of the fire and to extend the deadline for families to submit reimbursement claims to KIK until March 31, 2025. 

According to a November  report  by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the BioLab incident resulted in 17,000 evacuations, closures on I-20, and local shelter-in-place notifications. 

“You and your staff have publicly expressed a desire to “address the needs of impacted area residents and business owners” following that incident,”  the lawmakers wrote to KIK Consumer Products CEO Michael Sload.  “It has been three months since the incident; we request specific information regarding your efforts to do so.” 

“Although we appreciate these initiatives, Rockdale County residents remain uncertain about your company’s long-term commitment to their well-being, particularly in light of your decision to set a December 31 deadline for families to submit reimbursement claims,”  the lawmakers continued. 

As part of the inquiry, Senators Warnock and Ossoff and Representative Johnson specifically pressed the company for additional information regarding steps they are taking to support families in Rockdale County who are still being affected by this incident. 

This letter follows two other efforts to hold BioLab accountable for the September 29 fire and the residual impact on the local community. An October letter led by Senator Warnock and Congressman Johnson urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen federal oversight of facilities manufacturing or storing certain hazardous chemicals. The lawmakers  pushed  EPA Administrator Michael Regan to enhance federal oversight of facilities that manufacture and/or store Trichloroisocyanuric Acid (TCCA), which is at the heart of the incident at the BioLab plant in Conyers. That effort was followed by  a letter  at the end of October in which Senator Warnock and Congressman Johnson demanded answers to the company’s repeated safety failures leading to the September fire. 

The letter can be found  HERE  and the text of the letter is below: 

Dear Mr. Sload, 

We write regarding your company’s response to the September 29 incident at the BioLab facility in Conyers, Georgia that resulted in “multiple fires, extensive off-gassing, and a massive plume of potentially toxic smoke.” You and your staff have publicly expressed a desire to “address the needs of impacted area residents and business owners” following that incident. It has been three months since the incident; we request specific information regarding your efforts to do so. 

In a November 13 letter, you wrote that your company has “engaged contractors to remove debris from public areas and roads, and this work is now complete.” Further, you stated that debris was tested for asbestos and that results confirmed that none was present. Families in Rockdale County are concerned about the long-term impacts of this incident on their physical health and personal property. Therefore, we urge you to make the results of the debris testing publicly available and work with relevant State and Federal agencies to assist the public in understanding those results. 

At your BioLab-Conyers facility, chemical reactions have resulted in serious fires and off-gassing on three separate occasions in the last two decades. The September 29 incident resulted in 17,000 evacuations, multiple road closures including Interstate I-20, and nightly shelter-in-place notifications through October 16. In the same November 13 letter, you committed to reimbursing Rockdale County residents for “a variety of expenses stemming from the incident including lodging, food, childcare, pet care, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.” However, you failed to address specific questions regarding the number of reimbursements that have been requested, denied, and approved. We request you provide us with data regarding the number of reimbursements that have been requested, denied, and approved so that we may properly assess the degree to which BioLab is honoring its commitments to community members. 

On your community support website, you advertise a 24/7 call center, assistance from a dedicated community liaison, and the establishment of a Community Assistance Center to help affected families file claims. Your recent update on this initiative states that your company has “responded to more than 29,000 calls and 9,000 emails, as well as assisted 4,000 individuals through its Community Assistance Center.” Although we appreciate these initiatives, Rockdale County residents remain uncertain about your company’s long-term commitment to their well-being, particularly in light of your decision to set a December 31 deadline for families to submit reimbursement claims. 

Therefore, we are requesting detailed responses to the following inquiries by January 17: 

  * Will you commit to publicly releasing the results of any debris testing you conducted, and work with relevant State and Federal agencies to assist the public in interpreting those results, to assuage the long-term health concerns expressed by local families? 


  * Please provide the following reimbursement request data: 
    1. The total reimbursement requests your company received from local residents. 
    2. The percentage of those requests have been approved. 
    3. The number of requests currently pending. 
    4. The average processing time for reimbursement requests. 
    5. The total dollar amount of the reimbursement requests approved since September 29. 


  * Will you consider extending by 90 days the deadline for families to submit reimbursement claims to allow for submissions until March 31, 2025? 



Sincerely,

The plant’s operations are integral to the community, and this tragedy has profoundly affected many of the plant’s employees and the larger Camilla community.

Washington, D.C.  – During the first Senate Aging committee hearing of the 119  th  Congress, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) highlighted  his successful efforts to cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors, which went into  effect earlier this year  .  As a veteran member of the Senate Aging committee, Senator Warnock has worked to bring down prescription drug costs so that America’s seniors aren’t forced to choose between life-saving medication and other basic needs. 

“I’ve been laser-focused on reducing prescription drug costs and improving access to health care,”  said Senator Reverend Warnock. 

During the hearing, Senator Warnock also addressed how Republican-proposed cuts to Medicaid could negatively impact home-and-community-based services. 

“Medicaid provides coverage for home and community-based services that allow older adults and people with disabilities to receive the care that they need from the comfort of their home without going broke paying for it,”  continued Senator Reverend Warnock. 

Senator Warnock has long championed efforts to expand affordable health care access, starting with his advocacy to close the health care coverage gap in Georgia. In the  Inflation Reduction Act  , Senator Warnock secured two of his proposals in the law capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare patients and capping the cost of prescription drugs for seniors at $2,000 a year. The Senator also pushed for solutions to close the coverage gap. Last year, Senator Warnock introduced the  Capping Prescription Costs Act  ,  legislation to expand the cap of annual out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families. Senator Warnock remains committed to preserving and protecting access to health care for all Georgians. 

Watch the Senator’s full remarks and line of questioning  HERE  . 

See below a transcript of key exchanges between Senator Warnock the Aging Committee witnesses. 

Senator Reverend Warnock:  “Far too many seniors are struggling with high out-of-pocket costs for medications that they need to live. And that’s why I’ve been laser-focused on reducing prescription drug costs and improving access to health care. 

SRW:  “I can tell you as a pastor that I’ve seen the impact that this [high prescription drug costs] has on the lives of ordinary people, I’ve seen it up close. 

SRW:  “Dr. Hughes, how does lowering out-of-pocket prescription drug costs actually help seniors who live on a fixed income? I think in government we talk about these things in theoretical terms, but give us a clear picture of the human impact of this.” 

Dr. Susan Hughes:  “  We all depend on prescription drugs, prescription drugs have almost replaced regular and routine medical care, in terms of their live-saving and health maintenance effects, these are lifelines. 

DSH:  “For people, because of income constraints, unable to get a medication renewed or having to make a choice between rent, food, something else, or a needed medication, that shouldn’t happen. It shouldn’t happen to older adults, it shouldn’t happen in the United States of America.”

10:55:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Katie Britt (R-Ala.) recently joined Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and 15 of their Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on the lame-duck Biden-Harris Administration to stop rushing trade negotiations behind closed doors. 

The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is attempting to change at least three major trade agreements in secret, while sacrificing valuable leverage that USTR could use to win concessions from trading partners that would benefit Americans. USTR is seeking changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) by the end of the presidential term. 

“Unfortunately, [the] USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation,”  the Senators wrote.  “USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies.” 

The Senators warned that making concessions to trading partners would sacrifice leverage to make progress on a number of U.S. priorities. In USMCA negotiations, for example, USTR should use any available leverage to address Mexico’s illegal fishing practices and energy laws that favor Mexican fossil fuels over American clean energy. 

“Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark,”  the Senators continued.  “We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred.” 

Senators Britt and Tuberville  recently introduced  a concurring resolution expressing the sense of Congress that USTR Katherine Tai’s closed-door negotiation regarding Annex 14-C of USMCA is not legally binding unless approved by Congress. The  resolution  also makes clear the USTR nor any other federal agency can invoke the “joint interpretation” in any legal proceeding or assert it has any legal consequence unless and until it is formally approved by Congress. 

Last month, the  Wall Street Journal  published Senator Britt’s letter to the editor, which called attention to the Biden-Harris Administration’s closed-door negotiations. In the piece, she advocated for her bipartisan legislation, the  Defending  American Property Abroad Act  ,  which would impose retaliatory prohibitions against the Government of Mexico if it attempts to profit from the seizure of Vulcan Materials Company’s property and port facility in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Vulcan Materials Company is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. 

This week, the  Washington Times  published a column written by Senators Britt, Tuberville, and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) in which the lawmakers again rejected the Biden-Harris Administration’s dangerous, eleventh-hour effort and called on Congress to pass their  Defending American Property Abroad Act.

Joining Sens. Britt, Crapo, and Wyden in sending the letter to President Biden are Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan).

10:55:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: On Path to Senate Passage 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Katie Britt’s (R-Ala.) S.5, the  Laken Riley Act  , today cleared a final procedural vote, effectively securing the necessary support in the U.S. Senate for final passage. Following the Senate invoking cloture in a 61-35 vote, the legislation is on its way to Senate passage in the coming days. 

“This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will save lives, and it will help prevent another American family from feeling the pain Laken Riley’s loved ones feel every day,”  said Senator Britt.  “I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who came together to protect our communities. With today’s strong vote, we are in the final sprint to getting the Laken Riley Act across the finish line, honoring her legacy and making America safer.” 

The  Laken Riley Act  would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal aliens who commit theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting offenses so they cannot reoffend and commit further crimes. This legislation would also ensure states have standing to bring civil actions against federal officials who refuse to enforce immigration law or who violate the law. 

BACKGROUND: 

Senator Britt, with the entire Republican conference and Senators John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.),  reintroduced the  Laken Riley Act  in the 119  th  Congress  .  Following reintroduction,  the Senate advanced  the legislation on an initial bipartisan vote of 84-9. This allowed the Senate the opportunity to proceed to the legislation. 

On Monday, January 13, 2025, the Senate voted on the motion to proceed to the  Laken Riley Act  , which passed overwhelmingly. This allowed the Senate to formally consider the bill. 

On Friday, January 17, the Senate held a vote to invoke cloture on the  Laken Riley Act.  This required a minimum of 3/5 votes to pass. Cloture was invoked by a vote of 61-35, which ensures the bill can proceed to passage. The final Senate vote on the  Laken Riley Act  will be held in the coming days. This will only require a simple majority to pass. The legislation has 53 cosponsors.

10:55:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:55:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Katie Britt (R-Ala.) with Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) introduced a  concurring resolution  expressing the sense of Congress that U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai’s closed-door negotiation regarding Annex 14-C of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) is not legally binding unless approved by Congress. The resolution also makes clear the USTR nor any other federal agency can invoke the “joint interpretation” in any legal proceeding or assert it has any legal consequence unless and until it is formally approved by Congress. 

The  resolution  comes as President Biden’s administration has sought to reinterpret Annex 14-C of the USMCA with Mexico and Canada without the consent or appropriate consultation with Congress. These talks have included USTR Ambassador Tai actively undermining American interests, which would rob American companies, like Birmingham-based Vulcan Materials Co., of protections that have enabled investment into foreign-trade-partner nations. 

“President Biden’s lame-duck administration is effectively renegotiating USMCA behind closed doors without properly informing Congress and without regard for American interests. These misguided talks will rob American companies, like Alabama’s Vulcan Materials, of protections that have enabled investment into foreign trade partner nations. President Biden is essentially negotiating away due process for Americans. This concurring resolution makes clear to the President that his administration’s actions in an eleventh-hour, shadowy negotiation will not be tolerated,”  said Senator Britt. 

“The American people issued a mandate on November 5: they want President Trump’s agenda, and they want it now,”  said Senator Tuberville.  “For the Biden administration to try to ram through this anti-American business policy at the last minute is a slap in the face to the 77 million Americans who voted for President Trump. It’s especially concerning for Alabama-based Vulcan Materials Company in its ongoing dispute with the Mexican government. Senator Britt and I will continue working diligently to make sure Alabama businesses are put first on the world stage, not last.” 

The full text of the resolution can be viewed  here  . 

BACKGROUND: 

Senator Britt has been a leader in fighting the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to usurp congressional trade authority. She has also repeatedly advocated for Vulcan Materials Company to regain access to their port, which was unlawfully seized. 

Last month, the  Wall Street Journal  published Senator Britt’s letter to the editor, which called attention to the Biden-Harris Administration’s closed-door negotiations. In the piece, she advocated for her bipartisan legislation, the  Defending  American Property Abroad Act  ,  which would impose retaliatory prohibitions against the Government of Mexico if it attempts to profit from the seizure of Vulcan Materials Company’s property and port facility in Quintana Roo, Mexico. 

This week, the  Washington Times  published a column written by Senators Britt, Tuberville, and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) in which the lawmakers again rejected the Biden-Harris Administration’s dangerous, eleventh-hour effort and called on Congress to pass their  Defending American Property Abroad Act. 

Vulcan Materials Company is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2018, Vulcan initiated a NAFTA arbitration against Mexico in response to harassment, illegal land-use changes, and the unlawful shutdown of operations on a portion of Vulcan’s property in Quintana Roo. In May 2022, Vulcan’s production and port operations at the property were fully shut down using Mexican military force on Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s (AMLO) orders. 

On March 14, 2023, Vulcan Materials Company’s port facility at Punta Venado in Quintana Roo, Mexico, was breached and confiscated at gunpoint by Mexican military and police forces. Senator Britt called out the unlawful, unacceptable seizure at the time. She then helped lead a bipartisan letter to the Ambassador of Mexico to the United States, Esteban Moctezuma, regarding the militarized seizure of the property. Following a meeting between Alabama’s congressional delegation and Ambassador Moctezuma, it was announced that Mexican forces withdrew from the property. 

Following that invasion, AMLO continued to threaten to forcibly take over Vulcan’s port and limestone quarry, forcing their operations out of Mexico, despite the company’s consistent presence in Mexico for more than 35 years. 

In May 2024, Senators Britt, Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Hagerty, and Tuberville wrote Alicia Bárcena, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico, marking the two-year anniversary of the initial militarized shutdown of the property and urging the Government of Mexico “to reverse the actions taken against Vulcan and work towards a beneficial solution for all parties involved.”

Select excepts from the column are below. The full piece is available  HERE  . 

“The Biden Administration is working overtime to remind Americans why they voted for President-elect Donald Trump . . . one of the most harmful yet underreported measures is an effort by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to lock in before Jan. 20 a difficult-to-reverse trade proposal . . . Specifically, the Biden administration wants to finalize a new binding re-interpretation of our trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that would snuff out U.S. companies’ ongoing trade claims regarding unlawful actions by foreign governments. 

“. . . This measure would jeopardize American national and economic security. Vulcan’s port—the only deep-water port on the Yucatan Peninsula—is a key access point to the Gulf of Mexico and ports throughout the southern U.S. Its strategic importance is enormous . . . The CCP, no doubt, has its sights set on this Yucatan port if American control is extinguished. 

“America’s government must protect American interests. Congress should pass the Defending American Property Abroad Act to prohibit vessels that utilize expropriated U.S. infrastructure from entering American ports, thereby discouraging trade partners from taking advantage of us.”

In July 2024, Senators Britt, Kaine, Hagerty, and Tuberville  condemned the issuance  of a declaration that AMLO’s administration would designate Vulcan’s land and port as a naturally protected area, which would rob Vulcan of their rights to the land and ability to operate the port.

10:55:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:55:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senator Katie Britt (R-Ala.) today, during a Senate Banking Committee nomination hearing,  questioned Scott Turner  , President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). She emphasized her support for his confirmation. 

In the hearing, Senator Britt began by thanking HUD Secretary nominee Turner for his willingness to serve our nation and the American people. She also highlighted the important experience he will bring to the position to address how four years of the Biden-Harris Administration’s red tape regime and failed Bidenomics policies have exacerbated our nation’s affordable housing crisis. 

BRITT:  “We all know that we are facing a serious problem when it comes to affordable housing in this country. Whether it’s inflation, whether it’s high construction cost, whether it’s interest rates . . . low inventory – we’ve got a lot of things that we’ve got to tackle in order to be able to fix this. And unfortunately, over the last four years of the Biden-Harris Administration, these things have not gotten better, they have gotten worse.” 

BRITT:  “You are going to inherit a tremendous problem, but one that is critically important for people to be able to have their piece of the American Dream . . . I am thrilled about the Trump Administration coming in, you being at the helm, [and] getting [the Department] focused back on solutions and getting real results, rather than prioritizing overburdensome regulations, or mandates, or harmful price controls that ultimately only add fuel to the fire.” 

Senator Britt emphasized her commitment to working with HUD Secretary nominee Turner on their shared goal of streamlining HUD programs and implementing targeted reforms, while eliminating unnecessary regulations to lower housing costs. She continued by questioning HUD Secretary nominee Turner on his plans to advance solutions to help make homeownership more accessible for hardworking Americans. 

BRITT:  “. . .  when you look over the last year: homelessness jumping 18% in the last 12 months, 33% since 2020. It’s absolutely unacceptable. You look at the fact that a new cost [of a] home has now risen 30% since 2020 . . . and 24% of that is directly attributed to regulation. I know that you agree that that is unacceptable, and it’s clear that overburdensome regulation is part of this.” 

BRITT:  “I want to just talk to you a little bit about your intention here to assess and measure the effectiveness of current HUD programs. Tell me what approach you’re going to take there and how you’re going to see what is working for the American people, what is not, and what is your plan in executing that?” 

TURNER:  “So number one, and I’ve used this word before, ‘inventory’ and taking an assessment is key. You have to know what’s working and what’s not working . . . Is it building more affordable housing, or is it not? Is it helping the homelessness in our country, or is it not? Is it meeting the needs of Americans that we serve, or is it not? And I think if we go from there, to come back to you [and] this Committee, and say, ‘Hey, this is what we have found. This [is what] works, and this is what is not working. This is what is efficient, and this is what is duplicative.’” 

TURNER:  “So I think those simple principles could do very well going forward.” 

BRITT:  “Excellent, I look forward to working with you on that and your commitment to making sure that we get this right.” 

Turner:  “Thank you.”

10:55:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – U.S. Senators Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), and seven colleagues this week reintroduced the  Separation of Powers Restoration Act  (SOPRA), ending an unconstitutional practice handing unelected government bureaucrats unjustified deference in court. 

“The idea that administrative agencies should have deference in court proceedings flies in the face of the republican ideals of our Founding Fathers,”  Senator Britt said.  “There is no reason for unelected bureaucrats to wield near-absolute power, especially when our Constitution explicitly vests the authority and responsibility to make laws in the legislative branch. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act is a key step in handing the reins back to the people, not unaccountable figures in the administrative state. I look forward to continuing to work with President Trump, his administration, and the Republican majorities in the Senate and the House to restore control of government to hardworking Americans. I appreciate Senator Eric Schmitt’s strong leadership in introducing this commonsense, pro-constitution legislation.” 

Background: 

The  Separation of Powers Restoration Act  places a de novo standard of review within the  Administrative Procedures Act  in the text of 5 U.S. Code § 706, ending the unconstitutional practice of granting deference to administrative agencies. The legislation also allows the courts reviewing agency actions to decide all relevant questions of law, including the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions, rules made by agencies, interpretive rules, and general statements of policy. 

Under a de novo standard of review, courts will weigh the merits of the argument without a deference standard given to either side, placing American citizens and businesses—either caught on the wrong side of a regulatory enforcement action or challenging the validity of agency action—on an equal footing in court with an administrative agency. The House passed this bill in the 118  th  Congress. 

SOPRA would help restore lawmaking power where it is meant to reside: in the legislative branch, accountable to the people of the United States of America.

The bill will ensure Montanans enrolled in the program can access care as a non-drug alternative for pain management, as well as x-rays and other diagnostic services needed to determine and prescribe appropriate chiropractic treatments. 

“I’m glad to join this commonsense bill to expand Medicare coverage because our seniors deserve better access to care for their health care needs. The less barriers to care the better,”  said Daines  .  “I will always fight for higher quality, better access and lower cost medical care for Montanans.”

10:55:21 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. SENATE  – U.S. Senator Steve Daines helped introduce legislation to protect women and girls in sports. The “Fair Play for Girls Act” would require the U.S. Attorney General to submit an analysis of violence against women in athletics to Congress as well as provide recommended solutions to support women in sports. Daines also introduced two resolutions: “American Girls in Sports Day,” which designates October 10  th  as a day to celebrate female athletes’ accomplishments, and a resolution calling on the NCAA to protect women in sports. 

“The left is trying to erase women’s sports, but I’ll be pushing back every step of the way. It’s common sense that men do not belong in girls’ sports and I’m proud to fight for the safety and security of female athletes while also celebrating their accomplishments,”  said Daines. 

Fair Play for Girls Act: 

This bill would require the U.S. Attorney General to submit an analysis of violence against women in athletics to Congress as well as policy recommendations to support these young women. This analysis would include the: 

  * Impediments to fair and safe competition for biological female athletes; 
  * Prevalence of biological female athletes losing opportunities; 
  * Effectiveness of state laws aimed at mitigating the risk of bodily harm and loss of opportunity associated with the permitting of biological men to compete in women’s sports; 
  * Prevalence and root causes of online violence, harassment, and abuse against women and girls in athletics; 
  * Prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse of women and girls in athletics; and 
  * Effectiveness of federal and state laws aimed at preventing the sexual harassment and abuse of women and girls in athletics. 



Resolution Calling on the NCAA to Protect Women in Sports: 

This resolution calls on the NCAA to revoke its transgender student-athlete eligibility policy; urges the NCAA to require its member conferences to conform to this biological sex-based policy across all sports and all divisions; and calls on all sports-governing bodies in the U.S. to protect the category of women’s sport for biological women and girls. 

“American Girls in Sports Day” Resolution: 

This resolution would recognize October 10 as ‘American Girls in Sports Day’ to celebrate the accomplishments of female athletes.

10:55:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Steve Daines today discussed the importance of certainty and permanency of the tax code and the small business deduction with President Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent. 

Watch Daines’ and Bessent’s full exchange  HERE  . 

Daines:  Chairman, thank you. Mr. Bessent, good to have you this morning. I think what we’re seeing here in this committee is we really do have a divide between two very different philosophies about how to go forward and what’s best for the American people in this economy and what’s best for global competitiveness. I remember sitting right in this chamber as we were debating whether or not we should launch the multiple trillion-dollar massive spending bills, which was a $2 trillion dollar COVID bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, massive multi-trillion dollar bills that even Democrat former Secretaries of Treasury said could be inflationary, and indeed it was. You compare that outcome to what we are going to return back to, the policies of the prior Trump administration, that when you lower taxes for businesses and the American people, you create more tax revenue, you create more economic activity, you create more wage growth, particularly for minorities as well. And you start to get back into winning in terms of global competitiveness. We stopped the inversions. It was absolutely like ‘boom,’ went from multiple inversion to zero once we moved forward with this. And I couldn’t be prouder of what we did boldly back during the Trump administration when we tried to fight against, during this administration, these massive out-of-control spending bills that were inflationary, and the American people suffered greatly with these high levels of inflation, higher mortgage rates and so forth. And so I’m glad to have you as our next Secretary of Treasury and work with you to restore sanity back to where we were under President Trump. So, congratulations on your nomination and your willingness to serve. 

Daines and Bessent discuss permanency of the tax code: 

Daines:  With the expiration coming of these tax rates, we’re facing a $4.3 trillion dollar tax increase if we don’t act this year. As we begin drafting this bill, and I applaud Chairman Crapo, he brought us together as ranking member last year prior to getting the majority back, anticipating we might have this moment. And we started talking about, what are some key themes? Then we got into the details over several months of working groups for this next tax bill, to renew and protect and preserve the tax rates and prevent a $4 trillion tax increase. One of the key words was permanency. Permanency. I’ve expressed my support for the use of current policy baseline. I’ve expressed my support for permanency because we add uncertainty here in Congress with expiring tax code provisions. It’s time to make them permanent, to take one additional burden away from the American people wondering  what’s going to happen with Congress, whether my tax rates will depend on what happens in the next election or what happens if Congress can’t act? Let’s take that off the table with permanency. My question, Mr. Bessent is you’ve said we need to grow our way out of our current economic situation. I couldn’t agree more. And that’s just the philosophical divide we face here. Somebody who embraces more of the supply side idea, reduce rates, unleash capital into the free markets, and let those markets decide where that investment relies versus a bunch of bureaucrats here in Washington with wasteful spending. How does permanency and certainty of the tax code affect our ability to grow out of these problems? 

Bessent:  Senator Daines, I’ve enjoyed getting to know you over the past year with your work on the National Republican Senate Committee and talking to you in your office and also discussing your history in the private sector, both of the big company and small companies. And a question like that makes it clear to me that you understand the incentives, that it is incentives that drive everything in tax policy. And I can tell you that since November 5  th  , for small businesses, we have seen the biggest increase in optimism since they have been keeping the metrics. So…small business owners, many of whom they are pass through corporations, believe that we will get the tax TCJA across the line.  I think we could see a bigger increase in optimism. In economics when we have something we can’t define, we call it ‘animal spirits’ and I think we are seeing animal spirits, a nascent move up, but permanency and forward guidance gives people certainty. We get capital investment, we get hiring, we get real wages, the employers want to keep, train and expand their workforce. So everyone wins with permanency, certainty…A kind of forward guidance for tax policy I think would be one of the things that could unleash this new golden age that President Trump has talked about. 

Daines and Bessent discuss spending: 

Daines:  When you take a look at the private sector jobs in America, there are about 140million private sector jobs. 88 million of those jobs are from pass-through entities. That’s about 63 percent…and that’s the part that’s expiring. I mean, the corporate rates are staying permanent. It’s the pass-through rates, those 88 million jobs, 63 percent of the private sector jobs are taking a look at what’s going to happen here in Washington over the course of the next six to eight months. Very, very important we make these rates permanent and prevent a tsunami of $4.3 trillion tax increase that will come if we don’t act.

U.S. SENATE  – Senator Steve Daines today led his colleagues in introducing the “Firearm Industry Non-Discrimination (FIND) Act,” which prohibits the federal government from entering into contracts with groups that discriminate unfairly against firearm associations or businesses. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) joined Daines in introducing the legislation. 

“Democrats and woke corporations have proven over and over again that they want to carry out an unconstitutional, overreaching gun-grabbing agenda, and under no circumstances should our federal government use taxpayer dollars for these efforts. Doing business with anti-Second Amendment corporations erodes Americans’ trust and infringes on law-abiding citizens’ Constitutional rights. It must stop,”  said Daines. 

Read the legislation  HERE. 

Background: 

The “FIND Act” ensures that corporations cannot benefit from taxpayer-funded contracts and subcontracts while discriminating against firearm trade associations or businesses that deal in firearms, ammunition, or related products. Daines introduced the bill in both the 117  th  and 118  th  Congress. 

Statements of Support: 

“This legislation is critical to ensuring ‘woke’ corporations don’t use their financial might, funded by taxpayers, to deny essential services to the firearm industry. Corporations, in particular financial institutions, have been dictating public policies from boardrooms that throttle firearm businesses, which are Constitutionally protected. This bill will no longer allow those corporations to benefit from taxpayer dollars while at the same time using those funds to deny Americans their Second Amendment rights. We thank Senator Daines for his leadership to ensure fairness in business, reasserting Congress’s role in ensuring the federal government isn’t picking winners and losers in the marketplace based on politics, and protecting the ability of a lawful industry to compete for services without artificial and agenda-driven barriers” –  Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF Senior Vice President and General Counsel

10:55:29 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. SENATE  – U.S. Senator Steve Daines today secured a commitment from Trump’s Secretary of the Interior nominee Doug Burgum to bring common sense back to the Department of the Interior and fight for Montana issues like returning recovered grizzly bear populations to state management and issuing critical federal mining permits. 

Watch Daines’ and Burgum’s full exchange  HERE. 

Daines:  If confirmed, you will be eighth in line of succession of President of the United States, Governor, and that goes in line with when these departments became part of the United States government. The interior goes back to 1849, and the oldest agency within Interior is the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. I think it’s only fitting before I get into my questions, my remarks, if I might submit a letter for the record from the Coalition of Large Tribes (COLT), of which some of my, three of my 12 federally recognized tribes in Montana are part of- COLT. Of course you have five federally recognized tribes and members of COLT, but if I just read the letter that they wrote in your support, it says it’s been incredible for COLT tribes to have such a close supporter nominated to the Secretary’s office. He is someone in whom we have deep trust and confidence. We have gone to him with our most complex, difficult issues over many years. He is exactly the kind of leader tribes need at the Interior Department. And they close in the letter by saying this: Governor Burgum has COLT’s highest recommendation and endorsement to serve as the next secretary of the Interior. Chairman, I’d like to submit this letter for the record. 

Daines highlighted the successful recovery of the grizzly bear and secured Burgum’s commitment to work towards state management: 

Daines:  Governor, last week the Fish and Wildlife Service denied Montana and Wyoming’s petitions to delist the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem grizzly bears because these two populations have exceeded recovery targets by so much that the Service no longer believes these two populations are even distinct. We should be celebrating the fact that the grizzly bear has recovered. It’s an example of a great species now that has recovered and is prolific across these ecosystems. But sadly, this ruling coming out of FWS punishes Montana’s successful grizzly bear recovery efforts. It’s really completely backwards. We should be celebrating the recovery, but instead we are now having the sacrifice to adjust living with the bears. Whether it’s predation losses by livestock producers, as well as human safety. Sadly, many Montanans have been killed, badly mauled by grizzly bears, so the people back home take this very, very seriously. It’s literally gotten to the point up along the Rocky Mountain Front, west of Great Falls, where our playgrounds at one of our schools, they have a high fence there to protect the children from grizzly bears when they go out for recess. The Service keeps moving these goal posts for delisting and returning these bears to state management where it absolutely belongs, like we’ve done with the wolves. The Service set recovery numbers at 500 and 800 respectively for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. The most recent estimate is now best science, 2100 bears in these two ecosystems. Governor Burgum, would you acknowledge that the data shows the recovery of these two populations and commit to working with me to delist them? 

Burgum:  Well, Senator Daines, I’m aware of the data and this is a super important issue. I know it- to Montanans, it’s important to people and also in Wyoming and Idaho.  And I’m with you. We should be celebrating when species come off the endangered  species list as opposed to fighting every way we can to try to keep them on that  list because as you say, the complications. And the other thing you mentioned in  your remarks is also the state. Having been a governor, I understand how dedicated  the state fish and wildlife representatives are from Montana, from Wyoming from  North Dakota, South Dakota- I mean all of the folks. As the chair of Western governors  I came to understand how dedicated those state officials are. I think there’s a  belief that when they come off of federal protection that they’re unprotected. No,  they’re managed as they are all the other species in the state by the locals who’ve  got the closest data. So yes, I pledge to work with you on this issue. 

Daines also asked Burgum to prioritize critical coal mining permits and protect Montana jobs: 

Daines:  The Biden administration has been slow walking three critical permits for coal mines in Montana. The Bull Mountain mine south of Roundup, the Rosebud mine, the supplies coal for Colstrip, and the Spring Creek mine in Southeast Montana are all in desperate need right now to finalize permits. The Bull Mountains mine has already had to layoff hardworking Montanans because Biden’s Office of Surface Mining has refused to finish the needed reviews. My question is when confirmed, will you prioritize completing these permits so Montana families don’t lose their jobs? 

Burgum:  Senator Daines, this is part of a larger crisis our nation is facing around electricity. We have a shortage of electricity and especially we have a shortage of baseload. We know that we have the technology to deliver clean coal. We’re doing that in North Dakota. Senator Hoeven and others began these efforts over two decades ago. But we have an opportunity to decarbonize, produce clean coal and with that produce reliable baseload for this country. And so again we absolutely would want to work with you on this issue because this is something that’s critical to our national security. Without baseload we’re going to lose the AI arms race to China, and if we lose the AI arms race to China, then that’s got direct impacts on our national security in the future of this country. 

Lastly, Daines and Burgum discussed the importance of the Great America Outdoors Act: 

Daines:  I want to quickly close by highlighting the importance of a bill that I’m working with Senator King of Maine, we co -chair the National Parks Subcommittee. We’re proud of the fact that no matter which way the gavel goes, it goes back and forth over time in the U .S. Senate, Angus King and I are always co -chairs as we work together on behalf of our national parks. I’m working with him to reauthorize the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund. This is critical to address the deferred maintenance challenge we face with our great public lands. President Trump signed the greatest conservation [bill] in 50 years, when he signed the Great America Outdoors Act. And I thank Vice Chairman Heinrich for helping so much and getting that across the finish line. He signed that in 2020. I hope I can count on your support for reauthorizing this program. 

Burgum:  You can, absolutely.

U.S. SENATE  – U.S. Senator Steve Daines today joined Sandra Smith on Fox News Channelto discuss the ceasefire in Gaza, President Trump’s nominees and what to expect with President Trump and future Secretary of State Marco Rubio in office. 

Watch Daines’ interview  HERE. 

Daines on the Israel / Hamas Ceasefire Deal: 

This is no coincidence. Remember what President Trump said in early December: that there will be hell to pay if these hostages aren’t released by the time he’s inaugurated. We are five days away from President Trump’s inauguration. This is another example of peace through strength. I give credit to Prime Minister Netanyahu, his maximum pressure campaign against Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, and then you take President Trump—the footsteps are being heard right now by Hamas. There’s one thing the Middle East understands, and that’s force. That’s strength. This is not a coincidence. They are seeing that President Trump will be in the Oval Office and it can’t come soon enough. And it can’t come soon enough—on January 20. And that is why you’re seeing Hamas come to the table and actually acting on a proposal that’s been there since last May. 

Daines on Trump’s Nominee Hearings: 

Stepping back here with Pete Hegseth yesterday and the nominees today, Trump’s nominees are batting a thousand. And as I told President Trump two years ago, when I went down to Mar-a-Lago as chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee to make sure we got the majority back, you’re seeing this playing out. Great nominees from President Trump combined with a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, it’s this team ball that’s working out. They’re batting a thousand. And, today, on the Foreign Relations Committee, we have Senator Marco Rubio. There’s not a better pick for Secretary of State. He had 12 years on the Foreign Relations Committee, and understands foreign policy as well as anybody in the U.S. Senate. He has just done a great job today. Very proud to support Marco Rubio. Pam Bondi has done a great job in front of the Judiciary, Chris Wright a great job today in front of the Energy Natural Resources Committee. Again, President Trump picking these all-star candidates to be in his Cabinet, it ought to be lifting the spirits of the American people. They are going to be confirmed and we will be off the races here in late January. 

Daines on the Incoming Trump Administration’s Foreign Policy: 

This is a team that has moral clarity, particularly on the issue of Israel and Iran. We don’t have to stutter about our support for Israel, knowing who the good guys are and the bad guys are. There’s a lot of parallels here, Sandra, to what happened back in 1980. President Reagan was elected. It was 1981 when those 53 U.S. hostages, American hostages in Iran, were released after President Reagan took office. You kind of see this coming again. In this case, it’s an Iranian terror proxy, Hamas, holding both Americans and Israelis hostage. It’s just kind of remarkable. History repeats itself. You bring a new leader to the stage, the world stage, the world order is starting to shift and President Trump still has five days before he’s sworn into office. 

— 

You remember, when President Trump left office, he had the Abraham Accords, one of the great breakthroughs in the Middle East in terms of restoring peace to the Middle East. We’re on the verge of working with the Saudis, normalizing relationships with the Israelis. This happened under President Trump’s watch four years ago. And now with President Trump and Marco Rubio’s leadership and a Republican Senate, I’m optimistic. And, again, there’s one thing that the Middle East understands is strength. And President Trump brings strength. Marco Rubio brings strength in the Middle East with the force of the U.S. military to make sure they know we’re not messing around. When President Trump said, there’s all “hell to pay” to Hamas if they don’t release those hostages, they take that seriously, as they should. That’s why you’re seeing them taking action as we speak.

10:55:33 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:55:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. SENATE  – U.S. Senator Steve Daines today secured foreign policy commitments from Secretary of State nominee, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing. Specifically, Daines secured commitments from Rubio to combat Iran’s illegal oil sales, how he will help strengthen the United States’ ties in Central Asia and how the United States can work with Mexico to shut down drug cartels. 

Watch Daines’ remarks  HERE. 

“You are charged with one of the most important tasks the administration will have, and that’s advancing President Trump’s agenda and representing the interests of the United States around the world. I can’t think of a better nominee to serve as Secretary of State under President Trump than Marco Rubio. You’ll have a lot of active conflicts we’re working on, as we think about what’s going on in Ukraine, Israel, Sudan, ongoing nuclear weapons programs in Iran, the tyranny in Venezuela. The New Start Treaty has been completely disregarded by Russia- not to mention what we have to think about strategies as it relates to China. I could continue to list the results that we saw from the Trump administration, from the Abraham Accords, really moving forward here with significant, substantive advancements of American interests abroad. This next administration, and the leadership of President Trump, will be extremely consequential. This post could not be more important.”   


Daines questioned Rubio on his plans to combat illegal oil sales by Iran:    
  
Daines:  As you know, Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terror. In 2024, Iran exported roughly 587 million barrels of oil, an increase of over 10 % percent over the prior year. These illegal oil sales fund Hamas, the Hezbollah terrorism, the Houthis, the nuclear arms programs, drone technology that’s being used right now by the Russians against Ukraine. These oil sales are directly resulting in global unrest and they’re costing innocent lives. Senator, if you are confirmed, what would be your goals and strategies about addressing Iran as an adversary? 

Rubio:  My view of it is that we should be open to any arrangement that allows us to have safety and stability in the region, but one in which we’re clear -eyed. Any concessions we make to the Iranian regime, we should anticipate that they will use, as they have used in the past, to build their weapons systems and to try to restart their sponsorship of Hezbollah and other related entities around the region because they seek to become the dominant regional power. That’s their stated goal and it’s been clear by the actions that they’ve taken…What cannot be allowed under any circumstances is a nuclear armed Iran. What cannot be allowed under any circumstances is an Iranian regime that has the resources and the capability to restart and continue their sponsorship of terrorism. And what cannot be allowed under any circumstances is an Iran with a military capability of threatening and destabilizing its neighbors and potentially reaching the homeland as well, both kinetically and directly and also through their surrogate groups who have long planned contingencies for attacks. And let us not forget that this is a group, these are individuals that have spent the last five years actively and openly plotting the assassination of the president -elect and of multiple members of previous administrations. Think about this for a moment. When is the last time you heard that a foreign government is actively, openly, and admittedly seeking to assassinate the former secretary of state, the former and soon to be once again president of the United States?   
  
Daines also asked for Rubio’s commitment to work together to strengthen U.S. ties in Central Asia:    
  
Daines:  Shortly after the election and prior to Thanksgiving, I took a quick trip over to Central Asia. I discussed that with you a bit- to Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. In fact, in the last 12 months, I visited all five of the Central Asian countries. In fact, I was bedded down, speaking of Iran, 20 miles from the Iranian border in Ashkaba, Turkmenistan. They have the fourth largest reserves of natural gas in the world, but this is a part of the world that is often neglected, but has such strategic importance as you’ve got Iran, you’ve got Afghanistan, Russia, and certainly China, as they talk about living in a submarine, as they look into- Chinese are competing for their favor…One of the first goals of the caucus that Senator Gary Peters and I created of Central Asia is to repeal the Jackson-Vanik label on the region and extend permanent normal tribulations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. I realize you have a lot of priorities on your plate when you will be confirmed as our secretary, but I would say rescinding it would be a good faith indication, the Jackson -Vanik amendments that Central Asia needs right now to grow. My question is, would you work with me and Senator Peters to have your team work with us to remove this designation?   
  
Rubio:  Yeah, and I believe the permanent removal will require legislative action. I don’t think Senator Murphy has a bill on that as well. Yours is three countries. Look, I think this is a relic of an era that’s past. There are some that argue that we should use that as leverage for human rights concessions or leverage to get them to go stronger in our way as opposed to Russia and the like. But I think in some cases it’s an absurd relic of the past. I think it’s Kazakhstan, who the Department of Commerce has already said is a market economy. In fact, I think they hosted the WTO ministerial just a couple of years ago. So they’ve met the conditions. So we will work with you on this ’cause I think it’s important.   
  
Daines:  I’m looking forward to working with Senator Murphy on this. You know, that C5 +1, which is Central Asian countries, plus the United States. Hope we can work with President Trump, actually, to think about maybe hosting some kind of a summit there. Very strategic. After the withdrawal from Afghanistan, we need more friends in Central Asia, and I look forward to working on that.   
  
Finally, Daines and Rubio discussed the importance of cracking down on cartels crossing the U.S.-Mexican border:    
  
Daines:  In the time I have left, when I open up my comments, we talk about all these conflicts around the world, sometimes we forget some of the most important relationships are right in our backyard thinking about Mexico. With the near showing going on at the moment, a lot of production coming now into more of our time zone and hemisphere coming from China and so forth. Laredo, Texas is now the largest port in the United States. I think it’s one of the under reported facts in our country. You talked about the cartels, they have command and control certainly on the border at the moment. My question is, you think about Mexico, and you’ve been so active on Latin America and looking south of the United States, with President Scheinbaum now just coming in office, what are your thoughts around how do we become better engaged with Mexico to help them with their issue as it relates to the cartels basically which are running the country?   
  
Rubio:  …this violence that our border has to be addressed. I think they pose a threat to the United States most certainly the flooding us with the fentanyl, the criminal activities occurring within the United States facilitated by these groups who have become vertically integrated. These are not the Colombian cartels, these transnational groups are now vertically integrated, they are the suppliers all the way down to the street level and all the way up to the production level. They are vertically integrated criminal enterprises, but they are also threatening the sovereignty and security of the Mexican state. And as I pointed, there are journalists, and there are politicians who have been assassinated for standing up to these cartels, and it tells you the amount of leverage so they have over the government as a result of it. So it is in their interest, as well as ours, that we work cooperatively to take these groups apart and not allow them to continue the reign of terror, not just in the border region of Mexico, but spilling over into the United States.

10:55:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:55:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senator Steve Daines today secured a commitment from Trump’s Secretary of Energy nominee Chris Wright to support energy development in Montana and voiced his support for Wright’s confirmation in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. 

Watch Daines’ and Wright’s full exchange  HERE  . 

Daines highlighted the importance of an all-of-above energy portfolio and asked for Wright’s commitment to support reliable, affordable sources of energy in Montana. Wright agreed. 

Daines:  One of the first things you can do as Secretary, I think, is to refocus the Department on pro-baseload energy policies. Baseload power resources like coal, natural gas, hydropower, nuclear, I think will ensure that we have access to reliable and affordable energy year-round, whether it rains or snows or the sun’s shining or not. The world needs more energy, not less, and with the proliferation of data centers… how does Google and Microsoft and others think about it right now, that they’re buying baseload power? They need to think about load power as a way…to fund what they need to do here as it relates to the revolution going on in AI, blockchain technologies, quantum computing… I think the 50 percent forecast…is probably low…And you can help us get ahead of that curve. So, here’s my question, Mr. Secretary-to-be, will you promote policies, both at DOE and throughout the government that will expand energy development and ensure that reliable and affordable base load sources of power are protected? 

Wright:  Absolutely, Senator. If I get the honor and the privilege to be confirmed and to serve, you just summarized the top goal. Our electricity grid, as I’ve said earlier in the testimony today, it’s become more expensive and less reliable, reversing a hundred-year trend where that was becoming cheaper in inflation-adjusted cost and more reliable, and we’ve gone the other direction. We cannot go that direction. That’s not good for America. It’s not good for our industries. And that is a top priority of mine to work on. I think we violently agree that reducing emissions is better through innovation, not regulation. 

Daines and Wright also discussed the need to drive innovation to reduce emissions rather than imposing heavy-handed regulations: 

Wright:  If you look at the track record right now, almost all of the emission reductions in our country and across the globe, almost all of them have come from innovations. You know, in the United States, the biggest one by far has been the arrival of low-cost natural gas through the shale revolution. That was innovation, it was not imposed. We got low-cost gas, lower emission gas, not just lower greenhouse gas emissions, but lower pollutants, lower particulate matter, lower SOCs, lower NOx, that helps air quality. A lot of country emission reductions that have been from regulation and from top-down mandates have actually not been the emissions reductions they appear to be, they’ve more been an emissions removal. If you shut down industry in your country or in your state, the emissions from that industry don’t go away, they just go somewhere else. And if they go out of the United States with the cleanest and most advanced manufacturing technology, those emissions just go up. So really the only pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lift up people’s quality of life is through energy innovation, and America has been a hotbed of that, and we need to return a vigor and a focus on innovation, on energy, right here in this country. 

Finally, Daines asked Wright to work together to support quantum and high-tech innovation: 

Daines:  Montana is becoming a quantum powerhouse and places like Bozeman, my hometown, are leading some of this high-tech innovation. We’ve got the Quantum Leadership Act that we’re working on to spur more jobs and research in this area. My question is, when confirmed, will you work with me to bolster quantum and other next-gen technologies? 

Wright:  Not only I will, more importantly this administration will. This administration and President-elect Trump is passionate about leading the next generation industries and leading them here in America.

Washington D.C.—  U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle, today announced a $925,000 investment in Mapleton Water District of Lane County to improve the district’s raw water transmission line, protecting it from potential landslides. 

“These types of infrastructure improvements are crucial for the health of Oregonians and the land we live on,”  Wyden said.  “I’m gratified this big investment in the small community of Mapleton will shore up potential issues before they occur, saving money by preventing health or environmental concerns down the line.” 

“As I hold town halls in every corner of Oregon, I hear serious concerns about aging water infrastructure, especially in rural communities,”  said Merkley.  “These federal funds will help ensure Mapleton can update its water treatment system to meet the future drinking water needs of the community and improve community resilience. As we face increasingly severe weather events due to climate chaos, I’ll continue to fight for safe and reliable water infrastructure for all Oregonians.” 

“Rural communities need significant infrastructure investments to protect and modernize their water and sewer infrastructure, and disaster resilience,”  said Rep. Hoyle.  “This is a much needed investment for the city of Mapleton so they can modernize their infrastructure. I’m looking forward to seeing the project once it’s completed.” 

This infrastructure improvement investment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will go toward replacing the line, stabilizing the slope around the line to prevent future breaks, rebuilding undersized culverts, repairing an access road, installing a flood protection wall around the water treatment plant and installing a pre-treatment system. 

“The staff and Board of the Mapleton Water District are both grateful and relieved at the news that the USDA Emergency grant has been awarded,”  said Art Donnelly with the Mapleton Water District.  “This will help us to mitigate the hazard to our water supply, after our ability to provide reliable service was almost ended by damage from a severe winter storm in 2023. We are especially thankful for the outstanding help received in this complicated process from USDA.”

The programs receiving funding today will support the region’s farmers and ranchers under a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Klamath Water Users Association (KWUA), as well as the Klamath Project Drought Response Agency (KPDRA)—which was created by Merkley. The agreement cements a shared commitment between the groups to work together to improve water supply and reliability for the Klamath Project. 

> “Long-term drought has severe impacts on all communities who call the Klamath Basin home as it harms everything from ecosystems to the economy and everyday life,”  Merkley said.  “Continued direct federal investments like this to support drought resiliency efforts and strengthen water supply and reliability in the Basin are essential to make the unique region’s water go farther for families, farmers, ranchers, Tribes, fish, and vital ecosystems.”

> “Combating drought in the Klamath Basin demands action matched with significant federal investment to provide real assistance to the Oregonians living and working there,”  Wyden said.  “This $50 million investment from legislation I worked to pass means robust help now for the Basin’s water users, and I’ll keep battling for all possible additional funds that continue to support their short-term recovery and long-term resilience.” 

Of the $50 million investment announced today from the Bureau of Reclamation, $43 million will directly go toward drought response efforts by the KWUA, KPDRA, and Reclamation: 

  * $25 million for multi-year demand management and modified practices programs  , which include: 
    * Multi-Year Contracts:  Using funding, KPDRA would enter into three, four, or five-year contracts with producers, under which the producer would commit to not irrigate a portion of their acres. Payments will be determined per acre with an additional payment for beneficial add-ons such as cover crops or wildlife-friendly practices. 
    * Innovative Practices:  Using funding, the KPDRA would incentivize practices such as fall grain planting in lieu of spring. 
  * $10 million for permanent demand reduction programs  to voluntarily retire irrigation water use. Reclamation will give preference to areas not in commercial production, like turf replacement on football and soccer fields. 
  * $8 million for wildlife benefit programs.  These will follow the arrangement as KPDRA’s contracts with Reclamation in 2018 and 2020, where the KPDRA receives per-acre-foot payment based on approved arrangements by which districts provide water for fish and wildlife uses. 



Additionally, Reclamation will use $7 million to benefit fish species by planning and implementing projects at Keno and Link River Dams. 




> “This funding will be of great benefit to agricultural communities and the environment,”  said KWUA Executive Director Paul Simmons.  “We thank Commissioner Touton and her team for wrapping up this effort and providing tools as we continue our work toward a more stable future. We are also grateful for the support that Senators Merkley and Wyden communicated to the Administration.” 

Merkley and Wyden have long been champions for all Klamath Basin communities. While serving as Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Merkley secured a historic $162 million over five years through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  specifically dedicated to restoring ecosystems and enhancing drought resiliency in the Basin. Merkley and Wyden announced several major investments last year alone, including  $46 million  to boost ecosystem restoration and enhance water quality and reliability. They also announced  $72 million in new federal funding  for critical ecosystem restoration projects and agricultural infrastructure modernization, alongside a historic MOU between KWUA and the Klamath Tribes, Yurok Tribe, and Karuk Tribe to collaboratively drive long-term solutions to water challenges in the Klamath Basin. 

In the final days of 2024, Merkley and Wyden celebrated the passage of the bipartisan  Klamath Basin Water Agreement Support Act  , which was signed into law to further support farmers and ranchers in the Klamath Basin with improved tools to respond to severe drought, while restoring fish and wildlife habitat in the region.

ICYMI  : In Seattle, Senator Murray Highlights Importance of Vaccines and Lifesaving Scientific Research, Calls Out Threat RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary Would Pose to Americans’ Health and Safety –  PHOTOS HERE 

Murray, a longtime congressional leader on health care who has  led hearings  on addressing vaccine hesitancy,  spoke out forcefully  against RFK Jr.’s nomination 

***VIDEO of Senator Murray’s floor speech  HERE  *** 

Washington, D.C. —  Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member and former Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, spoke out forcefully on the Senate floor against the nomination of RFK Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)—making clear to her colleagues that elevating the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist to this position would have grave consequences for American families’ health and safety. Murray laid out in detail how RFK Jr. has long peddled views, and funded causes, that run counter to basic truth, facts, and scientific evidence—and there is much he could do as HHS Secretary to cause chaos and real harm to families, from  firing top scientists  and researchers, to  ripping away  the approval—or insurance coverage—of all kinds of vaccines and medicines, to  ending our focus  on infectious disease research, as he has  threatened to do  . 

“This isn’t a case where we can just look for areas of agreement or hope for the best,”  said Murray on the Senate floor.  “We are talking about a conspiracy theorist who is openly antagonistic to public health, and he will have tremendous authority over Americans’ lives and health care. It is not asking too much to have a Secretary of Health who believes in healthy food  and  believes in vaccines—especially when we are already backsliding on vaccines and seeing real and deadly consequences.” 

“And let’s not get cute here with excuses like ‘he is just asking questions.’ Because when he says ‘we need to know vaccines are safe’—he is ignoring the centuries of research we have already done on these vaccines. We  do  know they are safe!… Given his track record, we cannot just hope that if RFK Jr. finally gets power to undermine vaccines—a cause that he has, by the way, dedicated considerable time, and money, and effort to—that he’ll just give up,”  said Murray. 

Murray continued,  “If confirmed, RFK Jr. would have tremendous power to undermine vaccines. He could influence FDA’s approval of medicines and drugs. He could directly appoint people to CDC’s vaccine board, which influences vaccine coverage and costs. He said he will fire top researchers by the hundreds and pause infectious disease research for  years  —a threat far beyond vaccines. And let’s not downplay the fact that as Secretary, he would have one of the biggest megaphones in the world to spread anti-vaccine misinformation.” 

“And look, the vaccine lies just scratch the surface here. This is someone who won’t accept that HIV causes AIDS. This is someone who thinks chemicals in the water ‘turn people gay.’ He’s said that! This is someone who thinks 5G wireless is being used to ‘control our behavior.’ This is not someone that we, the United States Senate, should be telling the American people to trust on health care. He is not someone that should be handling the levers of power. And, for that matter, the same goes for some of Trump’s other health care nominees who have ignored science and promoted false conspiracy theories,”  said Murray. 

“Vaccines save lives. That is not a question. It is not a slogan. It is a fact. And if you cannot accept that fact… then you have absolutely no business leading the Department of Health and Human Services. None.” 

When President-elect Donald J. Trump first  announced  his intention to select Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of HHS, Murray immediately and  forcefully condemned  the move. Earlier this month, Murray  held a roundtable discussion  at UW Medicine on the importance of scientific research and vaccines—especially for children—and spoke about how Trump’s pick of RFK Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would threaten Americans’ health and safety. 

As a longtime appropriator and former Chair of the Senate HELP Committee, Murray has long fought to boost biomedical research, strengthen public health infrastructure, and make health care more affordable and accessible. Over her years as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, she has secured billions of dollars in increases for biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, and during her time as Chair of the HELP Committee  she established the new ARPA-H research agency as part of her  PREVENT Pandemics Act  to advance some of the most cutting-edge research in the field. As Chair of the HELP Committee, Murray was also instrumental in crafting the  American Rescue Plan Act  , including its landmark investments in  public health  and  health care  . Senator Murray was also the lead Democratic negotiator of the bipartisan  21st Century Cures Act  ,  which delivered a major federal investment to boost NIH research, among many other investments. Murray is also the lead sponsor of the  Public Health Infrastructure Saves Lives Act  (PHISLA), legislation to establish $4.5 billion in dedicated, annual funding for a grant program to build up and maintain the nation’s public health system across the board. 

In 2019, Senator Murray  co-led a bipartisan hearing  in the HELP Committee on vaccine hesitancy and spoke about the importance of addressing vaccine skepticism and getting people the facts they need to keep their families and communities safe and healthy. Ahead of the hearing, as multiple states were facing measles outbreaks in under-vaccinated areas, Murray sent a  bipartisan letter  with former HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander (R-TN) pressing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director and HHS Assistant Secretary for Health on their efforts to promote vaccination and vaccine confidence. 

Senator Murray’s full remarks, as delivered on the Senate floor today, are below and video is  HERE  : 

“Mr. President, when I was a very young girl, the polio vaccine was approved. 

“And to this very day, I remember my mom, saying ‘thank goodness!’ We can now send our kids to school and not have to worry they will get sick, be paralyzed, or live in an iron lung, or worse. The relief was overwhelming. 

“And that is why, the fear is so overwhelming now that Donald Trump wants RFK Jr.—an outright, unapologetic, anti-vax conspiracy theorist—as our nation’s Secretary of Health and Human Services! 

“Now, I want to be clear—I will not be shy about making my concerns quite plain with the American people. 

“That’s part of the Senate’s role to advise and consent to the President’s nominees. It’s our job to vet these nominees and put them through a rigorous process, to determine if they are qualified to serve. 

“That’s why I met with RFK Jr. yesterday, so I could be direct with him about my concerns with his anti-vaccine record, and so I could discuss the other challenges our nation faces, where HHS has a really crucial role. 

“I do appreciate his time, and I appreciate the opportunity to look for areas of common ground. But as I have said already, I oppose his nomination. Because, regardless of any other views he holds, his long history of explicitly anti-vaccine activism is utterly disqualifying. 

“And I am not the only one who is worried. Even Trump’s former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has said RFK Jr.’s agenda ‘will cost lives in this country.’ 

“I mean, just imagine if RFK Jr. was Secretary when COVID struck—we  still  might not have vaccines! After all, he called the COVID vaccine the ‘deadliest vaccine ever made.’ 

“This isn’t a case where we can just look for areas of agreement or hope for the best—maybe drug costs, maybe healthy food. 

“We are talking about a conspiracy theorist who is openly antagonistic to public health, and he will have tremendous authority over Americans’ lives and health care. 

“It is not asking too much to have a Secretary of Health who believes in healthy food  and  believes in vaccines—especially when we are already backsliding on vaccines, and seeing real and deadly consequences. 

“We eliminated measles in 2000. But last year? We had 16 outbreaks! Whooping cough has spiked in the country and in my home state of Washington. Polio—even polio!—is making a comeback. 

“These are dangerous diseases—and RFK Jr. would let them spread through our communities and schools like wildfire. And as any parent knows, when a bug goes around school, it doesn’t stop there. It comes home to mom and dad, baby brothers and sister who could be at serious risk. 

“So, I am here to talk some truth to the American people about the stakes here, and lay out the facts for anyone who might not appreciate the serious threat posed by RFK Jr. 

“Maybe you think ‘well, he’s not talking about vaccines like polio or measles,’ or he’s ‘only asking questions.’ 

“Except, know this: he founded a nonprofit entirely focused on attacking vaccines. RFK Jr.’s nonprofit has made videos promoting falsehoods about vaccines and autism, and sowing distrust in vaccines, especially among the Black community. 

“They tried to revoke the emergency authorization for kids’ COVID vaccines. They sued against measles vaccine requirements, even amid measles outbreaks. And it’s not just RFK Jr.’s nonprofit that should raise alarm here. 

“He has said he doesn’t know if the polio vaccine caused more deaths than it prevented. Or, another example, HPV vaccines led to a huge drop in cervical cancer. RFK Jr. suggested it increases cancer risk. 

“And let’s not get cute here with excuses like ‘well, he’s just asking questions.’ Because when he says ‘we need to know vaccines are safe’—he is ignoring the centuries of research we have already done on these vaccines. We  do  know they are safe! 

“And what’s more, he has not just been asking questions. These are statements I’m going to give you that RFK Jr. has made—these are  in his own words. 

“He has said, ‘I do believe that autism does come from vaccines.’ He has said, ‘They get the shot, that night they have a fever of 103, they go to sleep, and three months later, their brain is gone.’ And, he said the COVID vaccine was the ‘deadliest vaccine ever made.’ These statements are not just false—they are, Mr. President, irresponsible. And they are disqualifying! 

“Given his track record, we cannot just hope that if RFK Jr. finally gets power to undermine vaccines—a cause that he has, by the way, dedicated considerable time, and money, and effort to—that he’ll just give that up. 

“That is not believable. Especially when we know the lawyer helping him put together a team has tried to have 14 different vaccines pulled from the market himself, including, by the way, the polio vaccine! 

“And if you are thinking ‘well, he can’t really do anything about vaccines’—you need to think again. 

“If confirmed, RFK Jr. would have tremendous power to undermine vaccines. He could influence FDA’s approval of medicines and drugs. He could directly appoint people to CDC’s vaccine board, which influences vaccine coverage and costs. 

“He said he will fire top researchers by the hundreds and pause infectious disease research for years—a threat far beyond vaccines, I would say. 

“And let’s not downplay the fact that as Secretary, he would have the one of the biggest megaphones in the world to spread anti-vaccine misinformation. 

“Maybe you are someone who thinks, ‘so what if we have more whooping cough?’ Or, ‘a lot of people had measles, they lived.’ Well, I realize some people probably think like that because they have never seen the reality of these terrible diseases. Because vaccines have been so effective! 

“A nurse recently shared online what whooping cough can do to a baby, what she has watched families go through herself. I will warn you, it was soul-crushing. First the baby can’t stop coughing—not even to eat, not even to breathe. Then come seizures and strokes. Then a breathing tube, and a ventilator. And finally, a machine to take over failing heart and lung function. And then they die. 

“That is horrific—that is whooping cough, and it is far from the only disease at risk of a comeback. We don’t want that to happen, here in this country or around the globe. 

“Let’s talk about measles: it is one of the world’s most contagious diseases. It easily spread by coughing and sneezing, it lingers in the air for hours, and you are contagious four days before you develop a rash, and four days after. Now before the vaccine, millions of people caught measles annually, meaning thousands were hospitalized and hundreds died, most of them mostly young children. 

“But this is not just history. You want to know what RFK Jr. would do as Secretary of Health? I want you to look at Samoa. Before Samoa had a measles outbreak, he was there—he was there propping up vaccine deniers, and falsely blaming deaths on the measles vaccine. 

“After Samoa had a tremendous measles outbreak with over a hundred hospitalized, and at least 83 dead—mostly kids—no apology from him. No admitting he was wrong. Instead, he doubled down, and wrote to the prime minister suggesting vaccines were part of the problem. 

“  That  is who we want to put in charge of our nation’s health care? What do we think is going to happen? How many outright lies are we going to tolerate? How many deaths before we realize this nonsense is dangerous? 

“And look, the vaccine lies just scratch the surface here. This is someone who won’t accept that HIV causes AIDS. This is someone who thinks chemicals in the water might ‘turn people gay.’ He’s said that! This is someone who thinks 5G wireless is being used to ‘control our behavior.’ 

“This is not someone that we, in the United States Senate, should be telling the American people to trust on health care. He is not someone that should be handling the levers of power. And for that matter, the same goes for some of Trump’s other health care nominees who have ignored science and promoted false conspiracy theories. 

“His nominee to lead the CDC is an anti-abortion extremist, with zero public health experience—unless you count peddling the conspiracy that vaccines cause autism or promoting junk health care plans. 

“And then you have Dr. Oz, who has been named to lead CMS—someone who is known for pushing quack treatments, and debunked junk science, who will be shaping health coverage for millions, despite clear conflicts of interest. 

“I cannot drive home enough to the United States: this is not a game. These are not political roles without consequence. They have real power over whether Americans can get basic information and care. 

“Mr. President, I want to end on this note, and it is important. Vaccines save lives. That is not a question. It is not a slogan. It is a fact. 

“And if you cannot accept that fact—if you cannot be honest with the American people about it, if when parents look to you, worried about their newborn, wanting to do what is best for their baby, trusting your advice as a public health leader… 

“If you cannot tell them the same truth that centuries of science and experience tells us: which is that vaccines are safe, effective, and lifesaving—then you have absolutely no business leading the Department of Health and Human Services. None. 

“That should not be up for debate. A vaccine denier should not be our highest-ranking health care official. Thank you.”

10:55:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: Dept. of Commerce signs agreement to fund expansion of company’s plants in Silicon Forest and Massachusetts, plus job training 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and U.S. Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D, WA-03) announced that Analog Devices is poised to receive an investment of up to $105 million made possible by  the CHIPS & Science Act  , including $80 million for the company’s Pacific Northwest manufacturing plants in Camas, Wash., and Beaverton, Ore. In April, the Members sent a joint  letter in support  of Analog Devices’ application for federal funding for their Pacific Northwest Hub Expansion and Modernization Project. 

The Department of Commerce has signed a non-binding agreement with Analog Devices to provide up to $105 million in proposed direct funding to support projects in the Pacific Northwest and Massachusetts. The Pacific Northwest investment of $80 million will support the expansion of ADI’s facilities in Beaverton and Camas. The expansion will allow Analog Devices to make 70% more analog semiconductors at its Pacific Northwest facilities. These are specialized chips needed for everyday products like cars, medical devices, and communications equipment, as well as aerospace and defense systems. By making more of these essential chips in America, the project will help ensure U.S. manufacturers have a dependable supply. The company is also committed to making its operations more environmentally friendly by cutting its use of chemical cleaning materials in half. 

“This award is a big deal for Southwest Washington—with tens of millions in federal funding from the CHIPS Act on the way, Camas is poised to become even more of a hub for domestic chip manufacturing that will support local industries, make our supply chains more resilient, and create hundreds of good-paying new jobs in manufacturing and construction,”  said Sen. Murray.  “I’m also excited about the on-campus training center Analog Devices plans to establish to attract and prepare local workers for jobs across the semiconductor industry. I was proud to help pass the CHIPS Act, and as the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, securing the federal funding we need to actually implement the legislation and invest in critical manufacturing projects across the country will remain a top priority for me.” 

“This investment will strengthen America’s semiconductor manufacturing capabilities right here in Southwest Washington,”  said Sen. Cantwell.  “With this funding, Analog Devices’ Camas plant will boost production of essential chips used in everything from cars and medical devices to industrial equipment and defense systems. The company will also expand partnerships with local colleges and increase financial support for employees seeking to advance their careers. This investment not only protects against future chip shortages like the one that drove up prices during the pandemic — it creates life-changing career opportunities for the people of Southwest Washington.  “ 

“Innovation in semiconductor manufacturing in the United States is vital to our national security and how we can maintain our competitive edge across the globe,”  said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez.  “I’m glad we could help bring our dollars back home to strengthen Southwest Washington’s production of semiconductors and support local manufacturing jobs.” 

The Department of Commerce funding will enable Analog Devices to increase its capacity to manufacture front-end mature node semiconductors — reliable, precision-engineered chips that U.S. companies need for automotive, communications, healthcare, aerospace, defense, and consumer electronics applications. The expansion is expected to create up to 500 manufacturing and engineering jobs across all three ADI sites. 

The non-binding nature of today’s announcement is standard for grants allocated under the CHIPS & Science Act and allows for the prospective recipient to plan project details, source additional capital, and negotiate project milestones with the CHIPS Program before the award is finalized. 

Analog Devices also plans to use the investment to boost workforce development in the Silicon Forest through expanded partnerships with local education partners including Clark College, Washington State University, and Perry Technical Institute in Yakima. The company’s  Semiconductor Advanced Manufacturing Upskilling (SAMU) technician training facility  would offer programs to support manufacturers and collaborators in the region. The award would also allow Analog Devices to expand financial support for manufacturing employees working towards associate degrees and technical certifications. 

In August 2022,  Sens. Cantwell and Murray toured technology company nLight  in Camas, to see chip manufacturing workforce opportunities firsthand. 

As Assistant Majority leader in the 117th Congress, Sen. Murray played a key role in securing passage of the CHIPS & Science Act and has  held  events  across  Washington state highlighting the many ways Washington state is benefitting from the new law. In the Fiscal Year 2024 funding bill Sen. Murray negotiated and passed into law, she secured $10.6 billion overall for science and technology programs to implement the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act to help drive U.S. economic competitiveness. The Fiscal Year 2025 funding bill that Sen. Murray  passed out of committee  with overwhelming bipartisan support, 26-3, would deliver $11.2 billion—$635 million more than Fiscal Year 2024—to fund the CHIPS & Science Act.

10:55:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: Senator Murray  : “We are talking $83 billion over the first three years to implement this bill—that’s more than the annual budget for the entire Department of Homeland Security. That’s a lot of money to spend on a bill that is going to cause chaos, punish legal immigrants, and undermine due process in America—all while drawing resources away from true threats.” 

***VIDEO of Senator Murray’s floor speech  HERE  *** 

Washington, D.C. —  Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, took to the Senate Floor to lay out a forceful case against the  Laken Riley Act  that would drastically undermine civil liberties, divert resources from detaining true threats to public safety, and throw our immigration system into chaos—not to mention require tens of billions in additional federal funding, and a doubling in ICE staff to enforce. Murray laid out in detail how the  Laken Riley Act  would waste critical resources, undermine due process, and unleash sweeping changes to our immigration system—creating far-reaching chaos and undermining established Supreme Court  precedent  . 

“We can and do, already, detain and deport immigrants who commit serious crimes—and we are not about to change that,”  Senator Murray said in a speech on the Senate floor today.  “But Republicans have been ignoring the policies we already have on the books, to push for a bill that, in its current form, is more extreme, expensive, and broad than it first appears. I am very concerned that without serious amendments, this bill is rife with unintended consequences and powers that could be abused.” 

“As written, it will drastically undermine civil liberties in this country. It will throw our immigration system into absolute chaos by undermining  any  President’s authority to shape federal policy. It will cost tens of billions of dollars. And here is the kicker—it will end up punishing legal immigrants and diverting resources from detaining true threats to public safety,”  Murray said. 

Senator Murray outlined how the overly broad language in the bill is a clear attack on due process. Since the legislation doesn’t require a person to be found guilty of a crime to be detained and deported, a person could be arrested or charged even if they are innocent, or a child—the legislation has no exemption for kids and no process to keep it in line with our child welfare laws, meaning that under the legislation, a child could be locked up and even put on a plane without their parents.  “With such sweeping language, I am deeply concerned the Trump administration could abuse this law to deport Dreamers, or our farmworkers, or other essential workers who, again,  may never be convicted of a crime  ,”  Murray underscored. 

Murray continued by explaining how the bill, as written, is  “an open invitation for Republican state officials to dictate individual case outcomes—regardless of ICE—derail national immigration policy, and even disrupt international relations,”  including by wrecking major humanitarian relief pathways like Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan and Ukrainian nationals.Under the law, state officials could seek court orders to deport individuals—again without sign off from ICE—and in some cases, could even sue to halt visas from entire countries.  “  That is a policy that, by its design, will end up punishing the people who are following the law to enter the U.S. legally,”  Murray argued. 

“With a federal immigration system that is already too chaotic and complicated—just wait until any state AG can overrule ICE, undermine the President, and throw thousands of legal—  legal  —visa applications into limbo,”  Murray said. 

Senator Murray also laid out how, if ICE is required to spend resources detaining nonviolent cases, the agency will be left with fewer resources to tackle the most serious cases—and DHS already doesn’t have anywhere near the resources to implement this bill.  “ICE would need more than three times the current number of detention beds, a 265 percent increase, for this. It would need to execute 80 removal flights a week—almost double its current capacity. Not to mention it would need to double ground transportation. That all adds up to ICE needing to nearly double its staff, hiring over 18,000 additional people,”  Murray said.  “And to give you a sense of how expensive that is: ICE estimates it will need more than  triple  its budget in year one.” 

Murray concluded by urging her colleagues to demand a far more serious amendment process to the  Laken Riley Act  —one that would address the many issues with the way the legislation threatens due process, and the potential for it to be abused—and reiterated that being tough on immigration doesn’t require ignoring common sense, wasting crucial resources, or giving up our values. 

As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee in the 118  th  Congress, Senator Murray negotiated and passed a Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2024  funding bill  that provided new resources to stop the flow of fentanyl, strengthen efforts abroad to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations, and achieve a more humane, orderly, and secure environment along the southwest border. She is currently negotiating funding bills for Fiscal Year 2025. 

Senator Murray has  championed  comprehensive and humane immigration reform throughout her Senate career, repeatedly  pushing  for  legislative solutions  that would offer a fair pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in America, including Dreamers, farmworkers, and those with Temporary Protected Status. She has long worked on legislative efforts to bring dignity and humanity to our immigration system—from protecting the health and safety of immigrant workers, to recognizing and bolstering America’s historical commitment to refugees and asylum seekers, promoting immigration as an integral part of our communities, and more. 

Senator Murray’s full remarks, as delivered on the Senate floor today, are below and video is  HERE  : 

“Thank you, Mr. President. If you believe we should be able to detain and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes, and you took Republicans at their word that the  Laken Riley Act  was necessary for us to do that, you need to know: that is  already  federal law. 

“We can and do, already, detain and deport immigrants who commit serious crimes—and we are not about to change that. 

“But Republicans have been ignoring the policies we already have on the books, to push for a bill that, in its current form, is more extreme, expensive, and broad than it first appears. 

“I am very concerned that without serious amendments, this bill is rife with unintended consequences and powers that could be abused. As written, it will drastically undermine civil liberties in this country. It will throw our immigration system into absolute chaos by undermining  any  President’s authority to shape federal policy. It will cost tens of billions of dollars. And here is the kicker—it will end up punishing legal immigrants and diverting resources from detaining true threats to public safety. 

“First off, let’s talk about how extremely broad the language of this bill is. Under this bill, you don’t have to be found guilty of a felony to be detained and deported. That is a huge attack on due process. 

“All you need is to be arrested or charged—regardless of whether that is something as small as shoplifting a candy bar, regardless of whether it may become clear you are innocent, regardless of whether this happened years, or even decades ago, and even regardless of whether you are a child. 

“So let me just underscore that, because it’s important: this bill has no exemption for kids, no cut off age, and no process to keep it in line with our general child welfare laws. As written, this bill appears so broad a child could be locked up and put on a plane without their parents. 

“With such sweeping language, I am deeply concerned the Trump administration could abuse this law to deport Dreamers, or our farmworkers, or other essential workers who, again, may never be convicted of a crime. 

“And, to be fair, it’s not just Trump I’m worried about, because this bill is an open invitation for Republican state officials to dictate individual case outcomes—regardless of ICE—derail national immigration policy and even disrupt international relations. 

“Under this bill as written, any state attorney general could wreck major humanitarian relief pathways like Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelan or Ukrainian nationals. They can seek court orders to deport individuals without sign off from ICE. And, in some cases, they could sue to halt visas from entire countries. 

“That is a policy that, by its design, will end up punishing the people who are following the law to enter the U.S. legally. It could punish refugees who are fleeing violence. It could punish people who come here to engage in trade and in commerce that helps our economy grow. It could even punish American citizens, if they are hoping to get a visa for their spouse. 

“With a federal immigration system that is already too chaotic and complicated—just wait until any state AG can overrule ICE, undermine the President, and throw thousands of legal—  legal  —visa applications into limbo. 

“The bill also promises these lawsuits priority, which could be a huge burden on our courts. And if that weren’t counter-productive enough, not only will this bill as written punish legal immigrants, it will also divert resources we need to detain genuine threats to public safety. 

“If ICE is required, as this bill says, to spend resources detaining nonviolent—not even convicted—shoplifting cases and the like, they will have their hands tied as resources are stretched thinner and thinner by an overwhelming number of minor cases, leaving them with fewer and fewer resources then to tackle the most serious cases. And that is especially concerning, because DHS already does not have anywhere near the resources to implement this bill. 

“ICE would need actually more than  three times  the current number of detention beds—a 265 percent increase—for this bill. It would need to execute 80 removal flights a week—almost double its current capacity. Not to mention it would need to double ground transportation. 

“That all adds up to ICE needing to nearly double its staff, hiring over 18,000 additional people. And to give you a sense of how unrealistic that is, historically, DHS hasn’t been able to onboard more than 1,000 people in a year. 

“And to give you a sense of how  expensive  this is: ICE estimates it will need more than triple its budget in year one, really closer to four times their current funding level. 

“We are now talking up to $83 billion dollars for this legislation over the first three years to implement it—that’s more than the annual budget for the entire Department of Homeland Security. That is a lot of money to spend on a bill that is going to cause chaos, punish legal immigrants, and undermine due process in America—all while drawing resources away from true threats. 

“Mr. President, make no mistake, there are serious challenges we have at our border. There is a serious need for sensible immigration reform. But being tough on immigration does not require us to forsake our bedrock principles, like due process, or our moral obligation to keep children safe. It does not require us to ignore our common sense and waste crucial resources. 

“And so, while I hope to work with my colleagues to improve this bill—as I try to improve every bill that I can—I have to say, we have a long road ahead to address my deep concerns with the way this bill threatens due process, and the potential for it to be abused. 

“So I strongly urge my colleagues to demand a far more serious amendment process on this bill. But more than that, I urge them to demand a serious, bipartisan approach to tackling immigration in an effective, humane way. One that protects our country and upholds our values.”

10:55:55 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:55:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), led 20 other senators in introducing a resolution honoring the service of women in combat roles in the U.S. Armed Forces. The resolution comes as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense (DoD), Pete Hegseth, continues to face scorching criticism for, among many other things, his  long  record  of  denigrating  women  servicemembers who bravely serve our nation in combat roles. The resolution can be viewed  HERE  . 

Joining Senators Murray and Duckworth in introducing the resolution today were Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). 

“Every single day, women in our Armed Forces put their lives on the line to defend our nation. Meanwhile, Pete Hegseth has spent decades denigrating the role of women in the military in ways that simply don’t square with the reality of the real and needed contributions women servicemembers are making today, including in combat  —  his very recent about-face on this topic is simply not convincing. The contributions of our women servicemembers, their courage, and the immense sacrifices they make to keep us safe should never be questioned or demeaned—especially not by someone under consideration to lead the Department of Defense,”  said Senator Murray.  “I am proud to lead this resolution with my friend Senator Duckworth to send a strong message to every woman who bravely serves our nation in combat: we stand with you, we celebrate you, and our nation is forever grateful for your service.” 

“Contrary to what Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly, women have always made our military stronger and are more qualified to serve in their roles than Pete Hegseth is to serve as Secretary of Defense,”  said Senator Duckworth.  “There is no U.S. military as we know it without the incredible women who have earned their places in their units by going through the same rigorous physical testing and training that men do. I’m proud to co-lead this resolution with Senator Murray to honor our women warriors and make clear that any nominee who doesn’t understand the essential value of female servicemembers is not qualified to lead our military.” 

The senators’ resolution “recognizes the contribution, bravery, and sacrifices of women serving in combat roles in the Armed Forces; and encourages the continued celebration of the achievements of women in the Armed Forces to inspire future generations,” noting specifically that: 

  * Women have honorably served in the Armed Services with distinction since the Revolutionary War; 
  * The Department of Defense announced the opening of all military occupations and specialties to women in December 2015; 
  * Women have received numerous commendations for their service in combat after September 2001, including Bronze Stars and Silver Stars; 
  * Since September 11, approximately 3,000 women have earned Combat Action Badges and Combat Action Ribbons; 
  * Women in the military serve in special forces units, including as Army Rangers, Air Force Special Operators, and in the Marine Corps Special Operations Command. 



“Across the country, women in uniform make incredible sacrifices to defend our freedoms. They deserve to be recognized for their brave service regardless of who leads the Department of Defense,”  said Senator Bennet.  “I’m glad to join my colleagues on this important resolution to honor women in combat roles for their critical contributions to our national security and military readiness.” 

“The brave women of our Armed Forces make sacrifices every day in service to our nation, and they deserve recognition and honor for their tireless commitment to protecting our country. Their heroism, courage, and strength serve as a model for all Americans. Pete Hegseth’s attitude of disrespect towards women in our military discredits not only the capability of women servicemembers, but also of our nation’s military strength as a whole. This resolution rightfully recognizes the contributions of our nation’s women servicemembers to our national security and acts as a message of solidarity to the brave women dedicated to defending our country,”  said Senator Blumenthal. 

“Our military is made up of dedicated service members, including women serving in combat roles, who risk their lives for our country. To disparage the commitment and sacrifice of women serving in our Armed Forces is upsetting and unbecoming of a potential leader of our nation’s military,”  said Senator Durbin.  “Because Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth refuses to acknowledge the sacrifices of women in the military, I hope this resolution makes it clear that our nation is proud of and grateful for the women who have volunteered to serve our country in uniform.” 

“Thousands of brave women serve in our armed forces, making the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, protect our national security, and keep us safe,”  said Senator Hirono.  “Pete Hegseth lacks the understanding of how crucial these women are to our military. Our female servicemembers deserve a Secretary of Defense who does not undermine and disparage them or their contributions. I am proud to cosponsor this important resolution, to honor every woman who serves our nation in combat roles.” 

“The women who are bravely serving our nation in combat deserve nothing less than our utmost respect and appreciation. This resolution is a symbol of our country’s eternal gratitude for their dedication and service,”  said Senator Rosen.  “No one who denigrates women’s service in combat has any place leading the Pentagon, which is why I’ll continue to strongly oppose Pete Hegseth’s nomination for Secretary of Defense.” 

“With nearly 400,000 women serving in our military, and data showing fewer separations between the roles that they serve in, it’s as clear as ever that women are a critical part of our military – including in combat roles,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “I’m proud to be a part of this resolution expressing our profound gratitude to the women who risked everything to protect our freedoms.” 

“Women have made extraordinary sacrifices over the years to serve our country in combat. Time and again, they’ve put themselves in grave danger to defend our values and freedoms, and they – along with their loved ones – deserve our gratitude and respect,”  said Senator Schatz. 

“The U.S. military is the best in the world and the contributions of our women servicemembers play a key role in that success. They put themselves in harm’s way and make enormous sacrifices to defend all of us and our national security,”  said Senator Smith  . “Women in combat deserve recognition, and I am proud to cosponsor this resolution that does just that.” 

“The hundreds of thousands of women serving our nation across every branch of the military are an integral part of our country’s defense, and they deserve our support and gratitude. They do not deserve to have their sacrifices diminished or their ability to protect our country questioned, especially not by  those who seek to lead them. Women in combat roles put their lives on the line every day to stand up for America — America needs to stand with them in return,”  said Senator Van Hollen. 

“Proud, determined, and skilled women serve our country every day and have been doing so since America’s founding,”  Senator Wyden said.  “This nominee has denigrated women in all areas of his life. To put him in charge of women who choose to put their lives at risk for our nation is an insult to them, their families, and America. These women are more honorable than Pete Hegseth has ever been. I commend Senators Murray and Duckworth for leading this resolution that salutes all the women who have served our nation. Let’s show them the dignity, honor, and respect they have always deserved.” 

As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee in the 118  th  Congress, Senator Murray prioritized  investments in our servicemembers and military families  , including by delivering on a 5.2% pay raise for servicemembers, expanding child care services, increasing funding for sexual assault prevention services, and boosting mental health and suicide prevention resources. Senator Murray was the first woman to join the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the first woman to chair the Committee, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran, supporting servicemembers—especially women servicemembers—when they come home has long been a top priority for her.

Washington, D.C.  – Today U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, led Washington’s entire Congressional delegation—U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Rick Larsen (D, WA-02), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D, WA-03), Dan Newhouse, (R, WA-04), Michael Baumgartner (R, WA-05), Emily Randall (D, WA-06), Pramila Jayapal (D, WA-07), Kim Schrier (D, WA-08), Adam Smith (D, WA-09), and Marilyn Strickland (D, WA-10)—in sending a  letter  to President Joe Biden urging him to grant former Governor Jay Inslee’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration as a result of the devastating windstorms, heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides caused by a bomb cyclone that struck Washington state in November 2024. 

“The November storm delivered catastrophic impacts across the Evergreen state, impacting millions of residents and wreaking havoc on communities. The storm was one of the most severe the state has seen, toppling trees into homes, damaging power infrastructure across multiple counties, paralyzing major transportation corridors, and tragically claiming two lives,”  the members wrote in their letter to President Biden.  “An initial assessment reveals extensive damage to critical infrastructure, parks, cultural sites, schools, public buildings, and more, resulting in over $34 million dollars in damages across six counties.” 

“We commend the extraordinary efforts of our first responders and emergency personnel whose tireless work under dangerous conditions has been vital in protecting lives and restoring essential services. However, the scale and severity of this disaster has overwhelmed the state’s capacity to recover fully. Federal assistance is critical to supplement the state’s efforts,”  the Members continued. 

The bipartisan group of members urged President Biden to approve the request for assistance as quickly as possible. 

The full text of the letter is available  HERE  and below: 

Dear Mr. President: 

As members of the Washington state delegation, we write in support of Washington state’s January 14, 2025, request for a Major Disaster Declaration due to the devastating windstorms, heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides caused by a bomb cyclone that struck the state from November 17 to November 25, 2024. We implore you to approve the request for assistance as quickly as possible. 

The November storm delivered catastrophic impacts across the Evergreen state, impacting millions of residents and wreaking havoc on communities. The storm was one of the most severe the state has seen, toppling trees into homes, damaging power infrastructure across multiple counties, paralyzing major transportation corridors, and tragically claiming two lives. 

An initial assessment reveals extensive damage to critical infrastructure, parks, cultural sites, schools, public buildings, and more, resulting in over $34 million dollars in damages across six counties. In East King County, where the brunt of damage occurred, more than 400 miles of power transmission lines were affected by the storm, impacting tens of thousands of residents. Prolonged outages left individuals and families unable to heat their homes or preserve food or medical supplies. In Grays Harbor County, significant damage to a water level monitoring device at the Wynoochee Dam rendered it inoperable, posing a serious risk to the dam’s structural integrity and endangering thousands of people who live in downstream communities. Pacific, Snohomish, and Wahkiakum Counties experienced widespread destruction including sinkholes, crippled utility infrastructure, and damaged public and private structures. In eastern Washington, Walla Walla County suffered damage to local utilities and infrastructure, including a local cemetery. Debris removal and cleanup efforts are still underway. 

We commend the extraordinary efforts of our first responders and emergency personnel whose tireless work under dangerous conditions has been vital in protecting lives and restoring essential services. However, the scale and severity of this disaster has overwhelmed the state’s capacity to recover fully. Federal assistance is critical to supplement the state’s efforts. 

We reiterate our full support for Washington state’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration, including assistance from the Public Assistance Program and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. 

Sincerely,

10:56:04 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  –– U.S. Senators Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock and Congressman Hank Johnson are pressing for updates into the investigation of the September 29 chemical fire at the BioLab-Conyers facility, which impacted families in Rockdale County and across Metro Atlanta. 

Sens. Ossoff and Rev. Warnock and Rep. Johnson launched an inquiry with KIK Consumer Products, which owns the BioLab plant, urging the company to strengthen transparency around the public health impacts of the fire and to extend the deadline for families to submit reimbursement claims to KIK. 

According to a November  report  This is an external link  by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the BioLab incident resulted in 17,000 evacuations, closures on I-20, and local shelter-in-place notifications. 

“You and your staff have publicly expressed a desire to “address the needs of impacted area residents and business owners” following that incident,”  the group wrote to KIK Consumer Products CEO Michael Sload  . “It has been three months since the incident; we request specific information regarding your efforts to do so.” 

As part of the inquiry, Sens. Ossoff and Rev. Warnock and Rep. Johnson specifically pressed the company for additional information regarding steps they are taking to support families in Rockdale County who are still being affected by this incident. 

“Families in Rockdale County are concerned about the long-term impacts of this incident on their physical health and personal property. Therefore, we urge you to make the results of the debris testing publicly available and work with relevant State and Federal agencies to assist the public in understanding those results,”  they wrote. 

“You committed to reimbursing Rockdale County residents for ‘a variety of expenses stemming from the incident including lodging, food, childcare, pet care, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.’ However, you failed to address specific questions regarding the number of reimbursements that have been requested, denied, and approved,”  the group continued.  “We request that you provide us with data regarding the number of reimbursements that have been requested, denied, and approved so that we may properly assess the degree to which BioLab is honoring its commitments to community members.”

10:56:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. —  U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff today announced more Georgia veterans are now eligible for VA health care under the  PACT Act  . 

Thanks to the  bipartisan  PACT Act  Sen. Ossoff helped pass into law in 2022  , more Georgia veterans can now apply for benefits through the VA. 

The VA  recently announced  This is an external link  expanded VA health care for thousands of veterans through the  PACT Act  , including those battling bladder cancer, ureter cancer, other genitourinary cancers, acute and chronic leukemias, and multiple myeloma. 

According to the VA  This is an external link  , this step lowers the burden of proof for veterans, meaning that they do not need to prove that their service caused their condition to receive benefits for it. Instead, the VA automatically assumes service connection for the condition and provides benefits. 

“Our bipartisan  PACT  Act  is the most significant strengthening of VA health care in decades, and it was long overdue,”  Sen. Ossoff said.  “I encourage any Georgia veteran with questions about the  PACT  Act  or who need assistance with the VA to contact me and my office at  ossoff.senate.gov  This is an external link  .” 

To apply for care or benefits today, veterans can visit  VA.gov/PACT  This is an external link  or call 1-800-MYVA411. More information on eligibility can also be found at  VA.gov/PACT  This is an external link  . 

Sen. Ossoff continues working to support Georgia’s servicemembers, military families, and veterans. 

Last month, Sen. Ossoff’s bipartisan  Gold Star Children Education Act  to support the education of children after the loss of a parent who served was  signed into law  as part of this year’s  National Defense Authorization Act  . 

Last March, as a result of the bipartisan  PACT Act  championed by Sen. Ossoff,  the VA announced  This is an external link  that veterans who were exposed to toxins and other hazards while serving in the military are now eligible to enroll directly in VA health care without going through the VA benefits application process. 

Last January, Sen. Ossoff held a press conference in Decatur to brief Georgia veterans and small business owners on his bipartisan  Investing in VETS Act  , which was  signed into law  as part of the FY2024  National Defense Authorization Act  to increase opportunities for service-disabled veteran small business owners.

10:56:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff today questioned President-elect Trump’s nominee for CIA Director about protecting American elections from foreign threats, pointing to bomb threats against Georgia polling places in the 2024 election. 

Today, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee held a nomination hearing for John L. Ratcliffe to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 

During the hearing, Sen. Ossoff asked Mr. Ratcliffe for an assurance that the CIA will sustain intelligence collection to identify threats to voting rights and election administration in the United States, which he did. 

According to Georgia’s Secretary of State  This is an external link  , dozens of polling places in Georgia received non-credible bomb threats on election day in November 2024, which Secretary of State Raffensperger said originated from Russian actors, and which disrupted elections administration. 

“I want to begin with a matter of impacts Georgia on Election Day 2024. There were a series of bomb threats issued against polling places in DeKalb County, Georgia, principally predominantly Black, predominantly Democratic-leaning precincts, that disrupted election operations and the ability of folks to vote in the afternoon on election day,”  Sen. Ossoff said in the hearing  . “Our state election officials attributed those threats to Russian actors. What assurance can you give my constituents in Georgia that CIA will sustain collection to identify threats to voting rights and election administration in the United States?” 

“Those are the kinds of things that the CIA not only should do, but must do, and frankly, do better, in terms of collecting intelligence on how our adversaries intend, whether it’s through physical means or through a cyber means of disrupting or influencing elections. And you know, the CIA’s role should be to identify those threats over there before they come over here,”  Ratcliffe said.

SEN. OSSOFF:  “I want to begin with a matter that impacts Georgia. On Election Day 2024, there were a series of bomb threats issued against polling places in DeKalb County, Georgia, principally. Predominantly Black, predominantly Democratic leaning precincts that disrupted election operations and the ability of folks to vote in the afternoon on Election Day. Our state election officials attributed those threats to Russian actors. 

“What assurance can you give my constituents in Georgia that CIA will sustain collection to identify threats to voting rights and election administration in the United States?” 

RATCLIFFE:  “So, thank you, Senator for the question. I enjoyed our visit as well. I can give every assurance. 

“As you know, the CIA doesn’t have domestic authorities when we talk about election security issues. The FBI and DHS are the agencies that provide that protection, where the CIA plays a role, is if we have bad actors who want to influence or impact our elections, as you’ve related in this case. I haven’t seen that specific intelligence, but that, for instance, Russia, Russian actors were behind those threats. 

“Those are the kinds of things that the CIA not only should do, but must do, and frankly, do better, in terms of collecting intelligence on how our adversaries intend, whether it’s through physical means or through a cyber means of disrupting or influencing elections. And you know, the CIA’s role should be to identify those threats over there before they come over here.” 

SEN. OSSOFF:  “Thank you for that commitment to sustain that collection. I appreciate it.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE) issued the following statement in response to the Supreme Court’s unanimous  ruling  in  TikTok Inc v. Garland.  In the ruling, the Supreme Court upheld a law passed overwhelmingly by Congress requiring Bytedance, a Chinese company and TikTok’s parent company, to sell TikTok. 

“  Under Chinese law, all Chinese companies must do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, Congress acted, requiring TikTok to be sold within 270 days. The fact that the CCP has refused to sell tells you everything. They want to continue pushing their propaganda and spying on Americans. Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision sends a clear message that the bipartisan will of Congress must not be subverted. America’s national security comes first  .” 

Ricketts has long highlighted the threats posed by TikTok to Americans’ security and privacy. In 2020, Ricketts became the first Governor to ban TikTok on state devices. Last year, he voted for the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. On Wednesday, he blocked an attempt from Senate Democrats on the Senate floor to extend the timeline for a sale.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE), a new member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, questioned Scott Turner, President Trump’s nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Ricketts cited successful efforts made in Nebraska when he was Governor to address the need for more housing. 

“Affordable housing is just a critical national issue right now,”  Ricketts said  . “And each state’s particular housing needs are going to be different, right? It’s going to be different in Nebraska and New York. And in my home state of Nebraska, a lot of our shortage has to do with available housing, not just affordable housing. So it’s across the economic spectrum. And it’s both urban and rural.” 

Ricketts asked Turner about his plans to help Americans experiencing homelessness access a safe and stable home. A 2024 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  report  identified 771,480 people experiencing homelessness in America. This is an 18% increase from 2023 and the highest number ever recorded. 

“  I’m very familiar with that report,”  Turner said.  “To take inventory of the homelessness in our country and the programs that we provide at HUD, what’s working and what’s not, and also to engage the localities and organizations, including faith-based and others, that are successful around the country and partner with them.” 

Ricketts’ comments came in a hearing of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 

TRANSCRIPT: 

Senator Ricketts:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations on the new role. And Ranking Member Warren, thank you very much. 

“I look forward to working with both of you on this important committee to address the issues with regard to our economic national security, the well-being of our economy, and the financial security of Americans. 

“And looking forward to how we can work to cut the federal red tape around our federal housing programs and make them effective and efficient. 

“And, Mr. Turner, thank you very much for your past service to our country and your interest in continuing to serve our country here. And thank you to your family for being willing to sacrifice along with you as you do this.” 

Mr. Turner  : “Yes, sir.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “As you’re aware, we’ve talked about it a lot. Affordable housing is just a critical national issue right now. And each state’s particular housing needs are going to be different, right? It’s going to be different in Nebraska and New York. And in my home state of Nebraska, a lot of our shortage has to do with available housing, not just affordable housing. So it’s across the economic spectrum. And it’s both urban and rural. And you’ve mentioned the rural part and I appreciate that. 

“You know, Nebraskans have been hard at work to make sure that all Americans can achieve the American dream of owning that household. When I was governor, one of the things we did is we passed a bill, our Rural Workforce Housing Fund, which we set aside $7 million that then communities, nonprofits, developers could apply for grants to be able to use that. 

“One of the most effective ways we saw this is that they would turn it into low interest loans to be able to help the developers and the cities work together to be able to create either single family homes or multi-family dwellings. And then once that was accomplished would pay the money back and that could be used for another project. 

“And in fact, that was so successful, three years later, we added another $10 million to that program. And then, we also then, re-upped that, a similar type of program with our middle income housing fund that was more focused on urban areas. And then I also gave priority to Opportunity Zones. You’ve talked a lot about that. 

“We put state funds and dedicated from our State Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be able to help expand Opportunity Zones. I think that’s a great opportunity that you mentioned. And then I also signed into law expanded low-income housing tax credits to be able to incentivize private developers to build affordable housing. 

“So all these are things that, again, we did in Nebraska to be able to try and address some of these issues. And I point those out because, again, every state is going to be different. What I’d like to have you address is how do you plan on working with states and local governments to leverage what the federal programs are, and federal resources. How can you work with states like Nebraska, and how might that be different from other states to be able to develop affordable housing? And how can you make sure that the states retain as much autonomy as possible to be able to address these needs while working with them?” 

Mr. Turner  : “Thank you, Senator Ricketts. It was great visiting with you. I think that’s simple, as the Chairman mentioned before, going to the people, going to the states and listening, to see what has been successful in Nebraska. And take a note and say, if this has been successful, then being supportive of that and getting the government out of the way, getting the federal government out of the way and allow you in your state and other states around the country, to do those things that have brought them great success as it pertains to affordable housing.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Yeah, I obviously wasn’t here for a lot of the previous testimony, so I apologize if I’m repeating a question here, but you led President Trump’s White House Opportunity Revitalization Council. You worked to promote the opportunity zones. You’ve mentioned it a couple times here. 

“Is this a policy you want to carry forward with you as HUD secretary if you’re confirmed, and are there changes to the program you would make based upon your previous experience?” 

Mr. Turner  : “That absolutely is a policy we want to carry forward, because the impact of it, was tremendous. And obviously in every policy, every piece of legislation, every program that’s been successful, there’s always things you can tweak. 

“And we talked about watching film earlier. We have the first round of opportunity zones, so we got a lot of film on it, and the improvements that we can make, take the successes of it and do them better. Hopefully we can get the rules out quicker. You know, we can increase, operating businesses, but also use it as a platform, to build more affordable housing and create jobs in our country.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “So how do you propose to incentivize states like Nebraska to be able to work with you on your priorities and get them willing to put in state funds in tandem with the federal policies?” 

Mr. Turner  : “I think when you ask people to work with you, you have to show some success. You have to show that you are transparent, that you are willing to do what it takes to be efficient. And I think when people see your successes, and what you’re putting forward, they’re more apt to work with you. And so to go to states like Nebraska, and lay out a plan of what we want to do from a HUD standpoint, and work with you and other states, I think, will create a great partnership, going forward to meet the mission of HUD.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Well, one of the things we talked about was Americans experiencing homelessness and helping them find a safe and stable home. So obviously, the heart of HUD’s mission is to be able to do that. And it’s been a bipartisan priority. HUD’s 2024 point in time count identified 771,480 people experiencing homelessness, an 18% increase from the previous year and the highest number ever recorded. I know I’m just running out of time here, but can you give me just a high level. How will you use your office and your platform here to be able to reduce homelessness?” 

Mr. Turner  : “Yes, sir. Thank you. And I’m very familiar with that report. To take inventory of the homelessness in our country and the programs that we provide at HUD, what’s working and what’s not, and also to engage the localities and organizations, including faith-based and others, that are successful around the country and partner with them.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.” 

Mr. Turner  : “Thank you, Senator.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, questioned Lee Zeldin at the confirmation hearing of Zeldin’s nomination by President Trump to be Administrator of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). 

“The rule of law is what binds Americans’ trust to government,”  Ricketts said  . “All too often, we’ve seen under this Biden administration that the rule of law and congressional intent has been subverted by trying to appease radical, left-wing environmentalists. And that undermines people’s faith in government and the rule of law and the trust of our institutions.” 

“So thank you for your commitment to implementing the laws as Congress has written and has intended, to be able to get back to the fundamentals of the EPA, which is protecting our environment, safeguarding our health, and looking out for the well-being of the public,”  Ricketts continued.  “I’m excited to restore this proper balance of limiting risk with using sound science to protect our environment, which is the EPA’s mission, as Congress directed to do. We must follow the law to restore Nebraskans’ faith in our government institutions.” 

Ricketts made the comments in a hearing of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 

TRANSCRIPT: 

Senator Ricketts:  “Congressman Zeldin, good to see you again. Thank you very much for being here. And again, appreciate your family sacrifices in the past and serving our country and your continued willingness to sacrifice and serve our country again in this new role. 

“The rule of law is what binds Americans’ trust to government. All too often, we’ve seen under this Biden administration that the rule of law and congressional intent has been subverted by trying to appease radical, left-wing environmentalists. And that undermines people’s faith in government and the rule of law and the trust of our institutions. 

“So thank you for your commitment to implementing the laws as Congress has written and has intended to be able to get back to the fundamentals of the EPA, which is protecting our environment, safeguarding our health, and, looking out for the well-being of the public. 

“I’m excited to restore this proper balance of limiting risk with using sound science to protect our environment, which is the EPA’s mission, as Congress directed to do. 

“We must follow the law to restore Nebraskans’ faith in our government institutions. 

“So one of the areas that you’re going to have an opportunity to be able to do that has to do with our renewable fuel standard. And this is one of the things I’ve commented in the past. I love this committee because we talk about ethanol and biodiesel and renewable diesel all the time. Chairman Capito will get tired of me doing that. But with what we’ve seen in the past under the Biden administration is that, you know, RVOs are set below production levels, that and they’re chronically late. You know, for example, the RVOs for 2026 are required by law to be published on November 1st, 2024. 

“That did not happen, and it’s not likely to happen until probably December 2025. The 2023 and 2024 RVOs will lag behind industry production by 3 to 4 billion gallons. That’s the actual capacity of the industry today. 

“Congressman Zeldin, do you commit to give producers and the industry certainty in the marketplace, the marketplace deserves. And again, this is what businesses want. They want certainty. They want to know what the rules are so they can plan for it. 

“Will you give them the certainty by following the law as it relates to the timely and appropriate RVO rulemakings?” 

Mr. Lee Zeldin  : “Yes, Senator.“ 

Senator Ricketts  : “Great. Thank you very much. Another pressing biofuel issue for Nebraskans is year-round E15. I want to thank Senator Fischer and, your former colleague, Congressman Smith, for their leadership on the issue. And I’m happy to lend my enthusiastic support to this cause. The solution is over a decade in the making, and we were very, very close in the last Congress to actually getting E15 year-round. And I’m hoping to build on that momentum here in 2025. 

“Congressman Zeldin, although the issue will not be solved entirely by the EPA, can we rely on you to do your part to create a market of certainty for liquid fuel stakeholders and agricultural producers, by doing all you can to ensure that Americans will have access to E15 all year round? 

Mr. Zeldin  : “Senator, while I can’t prejudge the outcome of processes to follow across the board, I know how important this issue is to you, and I know how important this is to President Trump. The president has, expressed this time and again. With regards to you, you’ve heard it from, Senator Ernst. I’ve heard it from Senator Grassley, Senator Thune, Senator Fischer, and others, Senator Hawley. 

“So I understand how much of a priority this is for you. As far as establishing certainty, hopefully this is something that Congress is able to resolve. To the extent that you’re relying on the EPA to establish that certainty, I look forward to being able to do my part, and I want to continue to work with you, to achieve, the outcomes that we have discussed. 

Senator Ricketts  : “Great. Thanks. And, you know, one of the things that, and we’ll get into it in the second round of the questioning as well, but I think it’s really, really important that we get away from what the Biden administration was doing with regard to trying to tip the scales toward their solution. That’s how I interpret their delay on renewable fuels. We all want to reduce our impact on the environment. Renewable fuels are one of the ways we can do that. 

“They wanted to push their solution with electric vehicles. And again, electric vehicles are, can be part of the solution on how we do that as well. But what we should be focusing on is how American innovation, and I appreciate the fact that you mentioned this in your opening, american innovation is how we solve our problems in this country. So allow Americans to innovate, to find ways to be able to reduce our impact on the environment. And I’ll give you one example. Last year, maybe it was two years ago, I was seeing a demonstration by a hybrid vehicle that with for a $600 kit, had been equipped to burn 85% ethanol. And it was getting 38 miles to the gallon while reducing the amount of emissions that would have normally been done with a gasoline engine. 

“So that’s the kind of innovation that can help us reduce our impact on the environment. If we’re allowed, if we’re allowed as Americans to actually innovate. And rather than have this big top-down government, one size fits all, like we’re going to push this solution on you whether it works or not. 

“So I see my time has expired, but I look forward to the second round of our questions.” 

Second Round of Questioning: 

Senator Ricketts  : “Thank you, Chairman Capito, for having a second round of questions, I appreciate it. And, Congressman Zeldin, presuming that you get confirmed to be the EPA Administrator, you’re going to have to work to reestablish some credibility, reestablish the trust, for the EPA. And that’s going to involve a process of transparency and good faith action on EPA’s part. 

“Part of what I expect you to bring back is accountability. President Biden’s EPA had a $41.5 billion, billion with a B, program to carry out EV mandates and ‘environmental justice’. 

“How many additional dollars went to the inspector general’s office to conduct oversight over those IRA funds that went out? Zero. None. Yeah, that’s a problem, when you’re spending that kind of dollars. 

“Can we have your commitment that you will look into this to make sure those dollars were spent appropriately? That the process was followed properly for all those dollars, to make sure that any dollars that were not spent appropriately. In fact, Senator Capito and I actually had a press conference on how some of these dollars were being distributed. But if they weren’t being distributed, you’ll work to claw back those taxpayer dollars?” 

Mr. Zeldin  : “Yes, Senator.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Great. Thank you. We talked a little bit earlier also about the EV mandate. Part of what this IRA dollars were supposed to be pushing is this EV mandate. Of the 147 communities in my state that are classified as cities, 99 of them don’t have a single EV charger. 

“If you’re living in communities like Bloomfield, Alliance, Valentine, you’re 45 minutes from the nearest charging station. And in my state, EV adoption is like 2% when nationally it’s about 7%. 

“And of course, the current mandate that the EPA is pursuing with their emission standards was to have two thirds of all new vehicles being sold as EVs in the year 2032. 

“That that’s just clearly not realistic. And again, as we discussed, we should allow American innovation to be able to help us reduce the impact on the environment, not have the administration pick one solution that they want to push. 

“Do you commit to rolling back these out-of-touch mandates that are costly to Americans and dangerous to our energy grid, increase our reliance on our adversaries like the People’s Republic of China?” 

Mr. Zeldin  : “Senator, it is my obligation, if confirmed, to be following my obligations under the law. And with regards to Administrative Procedures Act, rules, laws, set out that guide. 

“The way I answer that question, I’m not allowed to prejudge outcomes going into rulemaking, to ensure that there is durability of any decision to be made at the end of the process, where my answer to that question could potentially be used against any type of a rule, regulation that is made. 

“I will tell you that I have heard concerns from you and many others in this chamber of how important it is to look at rules that are currently on the books. I don’t sit before you with any type of announcement that I’m able to make of any rules that are going to change upon confirmation. 

“I will tell you that I will not prejudge outcomes. However, it is my commitment to follow my obligations under the laws set by Congress, to look at laws, decisions, that have been made by the United States Supreme Court, and to make sure that we are pursuing common sense, pragmatic solutions that make sense to you, that you can defend when going back to the constituents that you fight so hard for, from your home state. 

“So I look forward to the opportunity of being able to make you proud, in being able to make this entire committee, the Chairman, proud, in hitting the ground running to do my part so that the EPA is being accountable to you as a Senator and as accountable to your constituents, as taxpayers, and as Americans.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Great. Well thank you, Congressman Zeldin. 

“One of the things we also talked about was certainty. We talked about it in the context of the RVOs. But there’s another area of certainty that we’ve talked about, and we need to continue to talk about. The Supreme Court’s  Sackett vs EPA  decision was a clear directive to narrow the scope of the federal jurisdiction on the Clean Water Act. 

“And here’s just one of the things that just drives me nuts. Because this has not just been a Biden administration, this happened under the Obama administration. The Clean Water Act over 50 times says navigable waters. Navigable waters means you can put a boat on it and go someplace. That’s the Merriam-Webster definition in really broad terms. Clearly out of scope of what the Congress’s intent was. 

“And the decision in this Act was intended to provide clarity to producers. President Biden’s WOTUS revisions have only confused it by talking about things like relatively permanent waters or unclear determinations on which waters are actually jurisdictional under the law. 

“Farmers and ranchers in Nebraska deserve better than an EPA taking years to decide the best way to regulate a ditch that might someday hold water. 

“Do you plan on providing clear and durable Waters of the US guidance to producers as an administrator?” 

Mr. Zeldin  : “Senator, I believe that it’s incredibly important for the EPA to provide clear and durable guidance as it relates to Waters of the US. 

“And the  Sackett  decision is easy to understand for any of those property owners in your state. Yet still they have questions as it relates to the rules and regulations that are on the books. 

“It should be as clear as possible so that your people can understand without having to go hire an attorney or someone else to assist them with compliance and definitions.” 

Senator Ricketts  : “Well, again, I would just remind you that the Clean Water Act says navigable waters. It’s a pretty plain English definition. Congress’s intent could not have been more clear. 

“And so I just remind you, as you’re going through that process, to keep that in mind. Thank you very much, Congressman Zeldin. Thank you, Chairman.”

10:56:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Yesterday on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE) called on his colleagues to pass the Laken Riley Act. The Laken Riley Act would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal aliens who commit theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting offenses. It would also mandate that these illegal aliens are detained until they can be deported. 

“People who break the laws in our country need to be held accountable,”  Ricketts said.  “That’s what the Laken Riley Act does. It requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people who are breaking our laws. When people come here illegally and they’re breaking our laws, they need to be held accountable.” 

“The election results were overwhelming. President Trump has a mandate to secure the border,”  Ricketts closed.  “Senate Republicans will stand up to help him do just that. The Laken Riley Act is our first step to be able to help him do that. And I call upon my colleagues from the other side of the aisle to continue to support this bill as they’ve done on the previous votes. Let’s get this bill passed. Let’s make sure other families don’t have to live through the tragedy that Laken Riley’s family had to live through.” 

The bill is named after 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, who was murdered while jogging on campus in February 2024. The alleged killer, Jose Ibarra, is an illegal alien from Venezuela. Ibarra crossed the border illegally in El Paso, Texas, in September of 2022. He was released into the country and bussed to New York. Ibarra was arrested in New York for endangering a child and was cited in Georgia for shoplifting in October 2023. However, Ibarra was not detained by ICE on either of those occasions. 

TRANSCRIPT: 

Senator Ricketts:  “Thank you, Mr. President. 

“President Biden’s open border policies have created a national security, humanitarian, and drug catastrophe in our country. 

“In 2023, law enforcement encounters at the border found 169 people on FBI’s terrorist watch list. 

“In previous years, under the Trump administration, that number was in single digits. 

“We’ve had ten and a half million border encounters since Biden took office. 

“On a single day in December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 12,600 people trying to illegally enter into our country. That’s just along the southern border. 12,600. 

“It set an all-time single day record for the number of people trying to break into our country. 

“In years past, administration officials have said if there is a thousand people encountered at our southern border trying to get in, that’s a crisis. 

“12,600 is a catastrophe. 

“Record amounts of deadly drugs have also flown into our country since President Biden opened our borders. 

“We experienced this directly in Nebraska. 

“In 2019, when I was Governor, Nebraska law enforcement took 46 pills laced with fentanyl off of our streets. 46. 

“Then after Biden became President, in just the first six months of 2021, Nebraska law enforcement took 151,000 pills off our streets. 

“From 46 to 151,000. 

“While I was Governor, after Biden became President, we saw that our law enforcement started confiscating twice as much methamphetamine, three times as much fentanyl, ten times as much cocaine, because of our open southern border and the cartels taking advantage of it. 

“And just like all around the country, our young people paid the price as well. 

“Taryn Lee Griffith, a young mom of two who took a pill that was laced with fentanyl and died because of it. 

“The single largest killer of Americans 18 to 45 is fentanyl overdose, all facilitated by President Biden’s open border policies along our southern border. 

“Jose Ibarra was a different kind of problem. 

“Jose Ibarra was a Venezuelan national who crossed our border illegally in the Texas area and asked for asylum. 

“His wife said he just wanted a better job. But regardless, the Biden administration released him into this country. 

“He was bused to New York City, and there he was arrested for ‘acting in a manner to endanger a child under the age of 17.’ 

“However, New York City is a sanctuary city. 

“He was not detained or deported as he ought to have been. 

“He was released. 

“He made his way to Georgia. 

“And once again he was arrested, this time for shoplifting. 

“But once again he was not detained or deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

“And because he was not, he went on to brutally murder Laken Riley. 

“This tragedy could have been avoided if President Biden had been protecting our southern border. 

“If illegal immigrants were being detained and deported. 

“People who break the laws in our country need to be held accountable. 

“That’s what the Laken Riley Act does. 

“It requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people who are breaking our laws. 

“When people come here illegally and they’re breaking our laws, they need to be held accountable. 

“With the Laken Riley Act, if you are committing theft, burglary, shoplifting, you will be detained, and tragedies like Laken Riley can be avoided. 

“This is just common sense that we need to enforce our laws. 

“To me it’s common sense that we need to protect our borders. 

“And thank goodness, starting in a few days, we will have a President who understands the safety of the American people is the priority. And President Trump will secure our borders. 

“The election results were overwhelming. 

“President Trump has a mandate to secure our borders. 

“Senate Republicans will stand up to help him do just that. 

“The Laken Riley Act is our first step to be able to help him do that. 

“And I call upon my colleagues from the other side of the aisle to continue to support this bill as they’ve done on the previous votes. 

“Let’s get this bill passed. 

“Let’s make sure other families don’t have to live through the tragedy that Laken Riley’s family had to live through. 

“Thank you, Mr. President.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE) expressed his support for Senator Marco Rubio’s nomination as U.S. Secretary of State. Ricketts’ comments came in reaction to Rubio’s nomination hearing, held earlier in the day. Ricketts made the comments while on a conference call with Nebraska media. 

“Combatting Communist China must be our top foreign policy priority,”  Ricketts said.  “To achieve that will require even more than an all-of-government approach. It will require a whole-of-society approach. That will take real leadership.” 

“Today’s confirmation hearing reinforced why Marco Rubio is the right person to serve as our next Secretary of State,”  Ricketts continued.  “He knows that a CCP-led world order would mean coercion instead of choice, tyranny instead of liberty, and dictatorship instead of democracy. He will help President Trump restore American strength and deter our adversaries. I will do all I can do to ensure Marco is confirmed on day one of the new Trump administration.” 

TRANSCRIPT: 

Senator Ricketts:  “On Sunday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s National Security Advisor, said quote: ‘The American people are safer and the country is better off than we were four years ago.’ 

“I don’t know who believes that. 

“I don’t believe that. 

“The election results show that a clear majority of Americans don’t believe that. 

“Nobody at home believes that after four years of high inflation. 

“Our friends around the world don’t believe that after four years of an appeasement-first foreign policy. 

“The opposite is actually true. 

“President Biden is handing President Trump the most dangerous threat environment our country has faced since World War Two. 

“Biden’s shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan was only the start. 

“His weakness prompted Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, starting the largest war in Europe since World War Two. 

“A war that continues to this day. 

“Biden’s pursuit of a second Iran deal funded Iran and its proxies’ attacks against Israel and our own troops in the Middle East. 

“He relaxed sanctions on Iran and enabled them to generate $100 billion in oil revenue. 

“Under President Trump – Iran’s foreign reserves were drained from $122.5 billion to less than $14 billion. 

“That meant Iran could not fund terrorists like Hamas and Hezbollah. 

“And let’s not forget – North Korea is more dangerous and aggressive than ever before. 

“But most concerning, Biden’s weakness has emboldened our greatest adversary: the Chinese Communist Party. 

“They are the head of the snake in a rising axis of dictators which aims to destroy our security, prosperity, and our very way of life. 

“CCP leader Xi Jinping wants to make his country the world’s leading superpower. 

“He’s taking steps to realize that goal. 

“Since the election in November – only two months ago – Xi’s country has stepped up their threats. 

“They’ve hacked our Treasury Department – including CFIUS. 

“This is part of a continuing campaign to hire Chinese companies to hack American assets. 

“They’ve continued what has been described as the ‘worst telecommunications hack in U.S. history.’ 

“They’ve destroyed or damaged important communications cables in Asia and Europe. 

“They’ve deployed ships to the South China Sea and have harassed our allies in their own territorial waters – including in the Philippines. 

“They’ve simulated a naval blockade near Japanese Islands for the first time in history. 

“They’ve conducted the largest naval drills in decades targeting Taiwan and the broader Western Pacific. 

“They’ve revealed new mobile piers suitable for a Taiwan invasion. 

“They’ve launched new jets and a new warship. 

“And that’s just since the election. 

“Xi’s pursuit of Chinese dominance has put us in a defensive posture all over the world. 

“Jake Sullivan is completely wrong. 

“President Biden’s appeasement of dictators has made the United States weaker and less safe. 

“Combatting Communist China must be our top foreign policy priority. 

“To achieve that will require even more than an all-of-government approach. 

“It will require a whole-of-society approach. 

“That will take real leadership. 

“Today’s confirmation hearing reinforced why Marco Rubio is the right person to serve as our next Secretary of State. 

“He knows that a CCP-led world order would mean coercion instead of choice – tyranny instead of liberty – and dictatorship instead of democracy. 

“He will help President Trump restore American strength and deter our adversaries.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE), a senior member of the SenateCommittee on Foreign Relations, questioned U.S. Senator Marco Rubio at the confirmation hearing of Rubio’s expected nomination by President Trump to be U.S. Secretary of State. Ricketts highlighted the need to develop an all-of-society approach to combat the growing influence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 

“Xi Jinping has vowed to be the world dominating power by 2049,”  said Senator Ricketts.  “We should take him at his word. That’s what he believes he’s going to try and do. It’s time for us to go on the offensive and abandon delusions about what kind of adversary we face. This is not a managed competition. This is a competition we must win. It will take more than an all-of-government approach. It will take an all-of-society approach to be able to win this. As our lead diplomat, Senator Rubio, you are in a position to set the tone. And that’s why I can’t think of a better pick to be the Secretary of State than you.” 

Ricketts asked Rubio to explain to everyday Nebraskans why an all-of-society approach to the PRC was essential. 

“If we stay on the road we’re on right now, in less than ten years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not,”  said Senator Rubio.  “Everything from the blood pressure medicine we take to what movies we get to watch, and everything in between… So if we don’t change course, we are going to live in a world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis, from our security to our health, will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not. That’s an unacceptable outcome.” 

Ricketts made the comments in a hearing of the Committee on Foreign Relations. 

TRANSCRIPT: 

Senator Ricketts:  “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

“Well, Senator Rubio, congratulations on your nomination to this very, very difficult job. I want to thank you for your previous service in the U.S. Senate and your willingness to take on this job, should you be confirmed. And I also want to thank your family as well for their support for you to be able to be a U.S. senator and to apply for this job as Secretary of State. And I want to also express my gratitude to all the members of the State Department. We have a lot of people who choose to serve our country overseas, spend time away from their friends and family, and I can’t think of a more noble calling. And you’re taking over a department that’s very, very important to us. 

“On Sunday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security advisor, said: ‘the American people are safer, and the country is better off than we were four years ago.’ Let me repeat, ‘the American people are safer and the country is better off than four years ago.’ 

“I don’t know who believes that. I don’t believe that. I think the election results demonstrate the vast majority of Americans don’t believe that. We don’t believe it at home. Inflation has hurt average Americans’ pocketbooks. Open border policies have put Americans at risk. And I don’t believe we see it overseas. 

“In fact, Senator Rubio, should you be confirmed, you’re being handed a job at a time when this country is in the most danger we’ve been in since World War II. It’s a very dangerous time in the world. And your opening remarks demonstrate that you know that. We’re not better off and we’re not safer. 

“President Biden started this with his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. That projected weakness and an incomprehension of what it means to have a policy of deterrence. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and started the largest war in Europe since World War II after that withdrawal. I believe it was because he saw weakness in this Biden administration. It’s been the President’s fear of helping Ukraine that has contributed to putting him in the untenable position they are today, by slow rolling the weapons that Ukraine needs to be able to defend themselves. His incomprehensible and incoherent policy has caused him to handcuff American liquid natural gas exports, while delaying tough sanctions on the Russian oil and gas industry, which, as you know, is the lifeblood of the Russian war machine. 

“The Middle East is equally disastrous. Instead of enforcing sanctions on Iran, Biden naively tried to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal, enabling the regime to generate $100 billion in oil revenue. And I want to point out that during the Trump administration, because of sanctions, Iran’s foreign reserves fell from $122 billion to less than $14 billion. That hampered their ability to be able to fund terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. What the Biden administration has done is allowed the Iranian regime to enrich enough weapons grade uranium to be a week or two away from having a nuclear weapon. 

“And since October 7th, President Biden has not supported Israel in the way he has needed. And because of the previously mentioned money that he’s allowed the Iranians to have, that has funded the terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, our allies like Israel, have been attacked. And we’ve been attacked directly. Thankfully, Israeli has had the courage to stand up to these terrorists and take matters into its own hand. And it’s led to the decimation of Hamas and Hezbollah. But no amount of revisionist history can change the fact that this was despite the lack of support from the Biden administration, not because of the support from the Biden administration. 

“And of course, let’s not forget North Korea and how dangerous they have become. And the fact that we are now seeing North Korean troops in Europe. A thought four years ago that was unthought by anybody. 

“And of course, one of the most concerning things is Biden’s weakness has emboldened the greatest adversary we have on the face of the Earth right now, which is the People’s Republic of China. 

“The People’s Republic of China is the head of the snake of this axis of dictators that are challenging the United States today. They are challenging our freedom, our security, and the very way of life we have. Beijing has had a direct hand in each of the problems I just mentioned. That’s why addressing any one of them cannot be done without making sure that we are thinking about how we are deterring the People’s Republic of China. When everything is a priority, nothing’s a priority. 

“And Senator Rubio, your top priority must be the People’s Republic of China. Since the election in November, so this is all within the last two months, the PRC has hacked our Treasury Department, including CFIUS, continued what has been described as the worst telecom hack in U.S. history, sabotaged important undersea communication cables in Asia and Europe, deployed ships to the South China Sea to harass our allies like the Philippines, in their own territorial waters, simulated a naval blockade of the Japanese islands for the first time, conducted the largest naval drills in decades, targeting Taiwan and the broader Western Pacific, revealed new mobile piers suitable for a Taiwan invasion, unveiled advanced aircraft and launched the world’s largest amphibious warship. And they’ve allowed Iran to draw down and ship nearly 3 million barrels of oil from a storage site in China. 

“It’s obvious that XI Jinping is positioning his chess pieces in preparation for war. He’s directed his military to be prepared to take Taiwan by 2027. And folks, that’s only two years away. Now it’s true, that does not mean that he will invade in 2027. And it’s also true that it’s not predetermined. But it should be very concerning to all of us that he’s given his military that direction. Because time and time again, dictators tell people what they’re going to do, and then they go out and try and do it. The only thing that dictators respond to is force, strength, peace through strength. This was something Ronald Reagan understood a long time ago, and it’s what we have to get back to the United States. 

“Xi Jinping has vowed to be the world dominating power by 2049. We should take him at his word. That’s what he believes he’s going to try and do. It’s time for us to go on the offensive and abandon delusions about what kind of adversary we face. This is not a managed competition. This is a competition we must win. It will take more than an all-of-government approach. It will take an all-of-society approach to be able to win this. As our lead diplomat, Senator Rubio, you are in a position to set the tone. And that’s why I can’t think of a better pick to be the Secretary of State than you. 

“So, first of all, do you agree that the PRC is the biggest threat that we face as the United States?” 

Senator Marco Rubio  : “The Communist Party of China, which leads the PRC, is the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted. They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now, and in every realm. 

“It is an extraordinary challenge. It’s one that I believe will define the 21st century. When they write the book about the 21st century, there’s going to be some chapters in there about Putin. There’s going to be some chapters in there about some of these other places. But the bulk of that book about the 21st century will be not just about China, but about the relationship between China and the United States and what direction it went. And I think you’re alluding to it in your statement. I know you may have another question. I don’t want to eat up all your time, but I do want to say this. 

“The Chinese believe that the United States are a great power and in an inevitable decline, and that they are an inevitable rise. Now they’re going to be, they already are. They’re going to be a rich and powerful country, and we’re going to have to deal with them. The danger is that because of our own actions, in many cases, a dangerous imbalance has built up in that relationship. We allowed them for years to pretend that they were some developing country, so we should allow them to continue to cheat on trade and commerce. We should allow them to continue to expand. 

“They lied about not militarizing and populating island chains in the South China Sea and the like, that we allowed them for years before we got serious about it, to conduct grotesque human rights violations, against Uighur Muslims as an example, one of the most horrifying things happening on the planet. And for years, no one talked about it. Which, by the way, not just has a human rights component to it, it allows them to use slave labor to produce goods that, at the expense of the rest of the world, talk about not just a horrific humanitarian crisis, but an unfair trade practice as well. We’ve allowed them to get away with things. And frankly, the Chinese did what any country in the world would do given these opportunities. They took advantage of it. And so I think now we’re dealing with the ramifications of it. I agree 100% what you said, but I remind you, and I remind everyone, I guess I want to make this point, that much of what we need to do to confront China is here at home. It’s not just abroad, it’s also here at home. We have to rebuild our domestic industrial capacity, and we have to make sure that the United States is not reliant on any single other nation for any of our critical supply chains. 

Senator Ricketts  : “And so, with four seconds left. How are you going to explain that to your average American, that we need this all-of-society approach? And to your point exactly, that we need, it needs to begin here at home, and so that people from my state, Nebraska, will understand and get on board? 

Senator Rubio  : “If we stay on the road we’re on right now, in less than ten years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not. Everything from the blood pressure medicine we take to what movies we get to watch, and everything in between. We will depend on China for it. They have come to dominate the critical mineral industry, the supplies throughout the world. Everywhere in the world, they’ve now established critical mineral rights. Even those who want to see more electric cars, no matter where you make them, those batteries are almost entirely dependent on the ability of the Chinese and the willingness of the Chinese Communist Party to produce it and export it to you. So if we don’t change course, we are going to live in a world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis, from our security to our health, will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not. That’s an unacceptable outcome. 

Senator Ricketts  : “Thank you, Senator Rubio.”

WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) announced that 15 additional medications have been selected for Medicare drug pricing negotiations, which will lower their costs for seniors on Medicare Part D. Thanks to the  Inflation Reduction Act  that Senator Rosen helped pass, Medicare now has the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. These 15 new drugs are in addition to the ten prescription drugs that have already been negotiated under this authority, with lowered prices set to go into effect in 2026. The new drugs selected for price negotiations include: 

“Nevadans are being squeezed by rising costs, and I’ve been fighting to lower them, including prescription drug prices”  said Senator Rosen.  “I’m proud to announce that thanks to legislation I helped pass, 15 additional medications will qualify for Medicare price negotiations, which will help lower their prices and provide relief for our seniors.” 

Senator Rosen has been leading the fight to lower prescription drug costs. Thanks to the  Inflation Reduction Act  , Senator Rosen helped lower prescription drug costs for seniors, lower health care premiums, and cap the insulin costs for those on Medicare Part D at $35/month per prescription. Last year, she joined an  amicus brief  supporting that federal law. Senator Rosen also introduced  bipartisan legislation  to lower out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors. Last year, she  announced  that Nevada seniors would have their annual out-of-pocket costs for brand-name prescription drugs effectively capped at $3,300 a year as a result of the legislation she helped pass.

WASHINGTON, DC  – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) met with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, President-elect Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security. During their meeting, Senator Rosen pushed Noem on the details of the incoming administration’s plan to carry out mass deportations, and emphasized the importance of protecting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programs. 

“Nevada is the proud home to thousands of DACA and TPS recipients who are invaluable members of our community, and who contribute to our state and economy,”  said Senator Rosen.  “I met with Governor Noem ahead of her confirmation hearing to press her on President-Elect Trump’s mass deportation plan, and explain how devastating it would be for Nevada. I also highlighted the importance of protecting DACA and TPS recipients, and reiterated my commitment to secure the border and keep fentanyl out of our communities.” 

Senator Rosen has been outspoken in her opposition to mass deportation, and her strong support for DACA and TPS recipients and their families. Earlier this year, she  applauded  the extension of TPS status for immigrants from El Salvador and Venezuela, after calling  on the Biden Administration  to continue to protect displaced Salvadorans. She has also  raised concerns  over the significant application delays impacting DACA recipients, and gave a floor speech  urging  her Senate colleagues to take immediate action to permanently protect Dreamers, while simultaneously continuing to work to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship.

This is the final step in a years-long effort to deliver this funding, which comes from the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s  $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program that Senator Rosen helped create to help states build broadband infrastructure. Thanks to this funding, along with other federal funding she secured, Nevada’s Office of Science, Innovation and Technology (OSIT) will be able to bring affordable, reliable high-speed internet to all of the more than 50,000 unserved and underserved households in every county in Nevada. 

“High-speed internet access is essential for Nevadans’ daily lives, and I’ve made it one of my top priorities to ensure every household in our state has access to high-speed internet,”  said Senator Rosen.  “I’m glad to see my efforts have paid off, and hardworking families across our state will finally benefit from this funding by being connected to high-speed internet.” 

Senator Rosen has been a strong advocate for expanding high-speed internet access in Nevada. Through her efforts, she has secured $550 million in federal funding through various programs and legislation for the High Speed Nevada Initiative, including the  Middle Mile Infrastructure Grant Program  she created. Senator Rosen helped write the broadband section of the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  , securing $65 billion in overall investments to make high-speed internet affordable for Americans, including through the BEAD Program. She also  successfully pushed  the Federal Communications Commission to update its deeply flawed National Broadband Map and ensure Nevada receives its fair share of BEAD funding.

10:56:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: The Bipartisan Bill Includes Guardrails To Ensure It Benefits Hardworking Nevadans, Not CEOs And Wealthy Individuals 

WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), helped introduce bipartisan legislation with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other colleagues to exempt tipped wages from federal income tax. Nevada has the  highest  concentration of tipped workers in the nation, and the bipartisan  No Tax on Tips Act  would allow workers to keep their tips without paying federal income tax on them. This legislation also includes guardrails to ensure that it benefits Nevadans who need it most, and not CEOs and wealthy individuals. 

“Nevada’s service and hospitality workers are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve financial relief at a time when they are getting squeezed by rising costs,”  said Senator Rosen.  “This bipartisan bill will ensure tipped workers in Nevada can keep more of their hard-earned money. I’ll also keep fighting to raise the minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage for service employees, lower costs, and cut taxes for all hardworking Nevadans.” 

“The Culinary Union applauds Senator Jacky Rosen for re-introducing the  No Tax on Tips  bill in the U.S. Senate and urges its swift passage. Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage that is the reality in too many states across the country will uplift millions of hospitality workers. This bill is a critical step to ensure one job is enough for workers to support their families. Senator Rosen understands the challenges working families face and is fighting for fair pay and taxation,”  said Ted Pappageorge, Secretary-Treasurer for the Culinary Union.  “Republicans have made promises to lower the cost of living for Americans, delivering on those commitments must start with meaningful action. In addition to eliminating taxes on tips, they must work with Democrats to raise the sub-minimum wage and address corporate greed driving up prices on essential goods like food, gas, and housing. It’s time for Congress to act now to deliver on real solutions for working families.” 

Senator Rosen has consistently supported  efforts to cut taxes  and lower costs for hardworking Nevadans while making sure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share. Last year, she sent a  letter  urging Senate leaders to put a bipartisan tax cut package on the Senate floor for a vote. She also introduced  bipartisan legislation  to cut taxes for veterans starting small businesses, and a  resolution  opposing the creation of a federal sales tax and calling for a tax cut for working families. Senator Rosen also helped introduce the  Working Families Tax Relief Act  to lower taxes for Nevada families by expanding the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. She also strongly supports raising the federal minimum wage and eliminating the minimum wage gap for tipped workers nationally. Nevada is one of seven states that already require employers to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage rather than a subminimum wage.

10:56:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Senator Rosen Called for Middle-Class Tax Cuts & Expressed Concerns About Republican Plans For A Tax Package That Overwhelmingly Benefits Billionaires And Large Corporations 

Watch Senator Rosen’s Full Remarks  HERE  . 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) took to the floor of the Senate to call for meaningful tax relief that benefits hardworking Nevada families and small businesses amid rising costs. In her remarks, Senator Rosen blasted President-Elect Trump’s plans to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and billionaires at the expense of hardworking Nevadans, and she called for bipartisan cooperation in efforts to reform the tax system. 

Below is an excerpt from her speech: 

Heading into the new Administration, I’m deeply concerned about President Trump’s plan to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and billionaires on the backs of workers, senior citizens, and middle-class families. 

When the Trump tax cuts were first passed in 2017, they overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest individuals and the largest corporations, while increasing our national debt and leaving the middle class and working families, well, they just left them with much less to show for it. 

And Senate Democrats – we will fight – we will fight to stop this from happening again. 

As we negotiate the upcoming comprehensive tax reform package, we must focus on making sure it provides meaningful tax relief for hardworking families, for you, for all of us. 

While the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans look out for billionaires and corporations, Senate Democrats are working for you. 

For one, we should be working to restart or expand several key tax credits that help support American families, like expanding the Child Tax Credit, which will increase the amount of hard-earned money families get to keep in their pocket. 

We also need to use this opportunity to address the high cost of housing, which is impacting families in Nevada and across the country. We must expand the Low Income Housing Tax Credit so that we can, well, just build more housing, increase supply, and that ultimately lowers costs for you, for everyone. 

As someone who grew up in a working-class family, I know what it’s like to work multiple jobs and rely on tips to make ends meet. 

That’s why we need to make sure we put money back in the pockets of hardworking Nevadans, which is why any package – any package – should include the bipartisan plan to eliminate income tax on tips for service and hospitality workers. 

By ending income tax on tips and adding guardrails to prevent the ultra-wealthy and CEOs from exploiting loopholes, we can make sure that Nevadans keep more of their hard-earned money. 

We also need to provide a broad-based tax cut for working families and the middle class, and make sure that families making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year don’t see a tax hike. 

Instead of lowering already low tax rates for corporations, we should be providing much-needed tax relief for our small businesses, like restoring research and development expensing. 

Our country’s strength has always come from the middle class—our teachers, our first responders, our small business owners, our factory workers, families who get up every morning, every day, they send their kids off to school, and then they go out and they work hard to make our nation run. 

And they deserve it. They deserve the tax policies that work for them, not tax cuts that leave them behind while the wealthiest of us – the wealthiest of billionaires, the big corporations – reap the tax rewards.

10:56:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, released the following statement on the agreement reached between Israel and Hamas to release the hostages and gradually pause the fighting in Gaza. 

“On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists shocked the human conscience when they carried out a brutal attack on Israel that killed innocent men, women, and children, and took hundreds hostage. For more than a year, Hamas has kept these innocent people captive under inhumane conditions, inflicting an unimaginable amount of pain and suffering on their families,”  said Senator Rosen  . “Today’s agreement will finally begin the critical process of bringing the hostages home and providing much-needed closure for these families, who have shown incredible strength and resilience every single time I’ve met with them. As I promised these hostage families, the United States will not rest until every hostage, alive or dead, is returned home. 

“Bipartisan, diplomatic leadership helped usher forward this agreement, and I hope it will lead to the end of this conflict and the protection of innocent civilian lives. This deal was possible because of steadfast and unwavering U.S. support for Israel, which must continue to ensure Israel has the capabilities it needs to defend itself from Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorist proxies in the region,”  she concluded. 

Senator Rosen has been a leader in the fight to support Israel and ensure the remaining hostages are freed by Hamas. Following the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, Senator Rosen traveled to Israel as part of a bipartisan Congressional delegation and met with the families of the innocent people who were taken hostage. Since then, she has repeatedly called on Hamas to release the hostages. Senator Rosen also sent a  bipartisan letter  calling on President Biden to leverage the U.S. relationship with Qatar to secure the immediate release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

10:56:50 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:56:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) reintroduced the bicameral  Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act.  This legislation would guarantee state, tribal, and local officials are given a meaningful voice in the decision-making process when a nuclear waste repository is proposed in their community. Representatives Dina Titus (D-NV-01), Steven Horsford (D-NV-04) and Susie Lee (D-NV-03) have introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

“Nevadans have been overwhelmingly clear in their opposition to making Nevada the nation’s nuclear waste dumping ground,”  said Senator Rosen.  “This legislation will ensure that states like Nevada have a say in opposing the storage of nuclear waste in their backyard. I’ll always fight against Washington’s efforts to bring nuclear waste to our state.” 

“I’ve said for years that Washington shouldn’t have the unilateral authority to make decisions that will impact communities and the environment in the Silver State for generations to come,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “Nevadans have made it clear, Yucca Mountain is dead. This legislation will give local and Tribal leaders the seat at the table they deserve in decision-making about nuclear repositories in their communities – in Nevada and across the country. I will continue to fight to make sure Nevadans’ voices are heard.” 

“Over more than three decades and at every step in the process, the Yucca Mountain project has faltered because Nevadans do not want nuclear waste stored in our state,”  said Congresswoman Titus.  “We must codify this opposition into law to protect the health and safety of our communities and guarantee a process that requires the consent of state, local, and tribal leaders. Nevada is not a nuclear waste land. We don’t produce nuclear waste, and we shouldn’t be forced to store it.” 

“Nevadans will not stand by at attempts to make our state a nuclear dumping ground,”  said Congressman Horsford  .  “Our public health is on the line; our environmental safety is on the line; our ability to feel secure in our communities is on the line – so our voices will not be silenced. I’m proud to cosponsor the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act to require local consent for any attempt to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, and I will always work to prevent this ill-conceived project from moving forward.” 

“Nevada has made it clear for decades that we refuse to become the nation’s nuclear dumping ground,” said  Congresswoman Lee  . “This bill ensures that nuclear waste projects, like Yucca Mountain, cannot move forward without consent from the communities they affect. I’ll continue fighting against attempts to revive Yucca Mountain.” 

The  Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act  is based on recommendations from Department of Energy’s (DOE) 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future and DOE’s 2017 consent-based siting report. Accordingly, this bill would require that the Secretary of Energy secure written consent from the following entities before moving forward with a nuclear waste repository: 

  * Governor of the host state 
  * Affected units of local government 
  * Each contiguous unit of local government primarily affected by the repository 
  * Affected Tribes 



Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto, along with Representatives Titus, Horsford, and Lee, have all fought to ensure Yucca Mountain remains dead. These members of the Nevada delegation successfully fought the Trump Administration’s early efforts to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, by preventing funds from being included for the failed site in every final appropriations bill during the Trump Presidency. Last year, Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto  introduced legislation  to ban Yucca Mountain from being a nuclear waste dumping ground and repurpose it for alternative job-creating projects. Following Nevada’s legal motion to terminate federal licensing efforts at Yucca Mountain, Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto  sent a letter  to the Department of Energy reiterating their strong opposition to Yucca Mountain.

Senator Rosen:  We thoroughly – try to thoroughly – vet every single nominee, regardless of party, regardless of position. That is our role in the Senate, to advise and consent […] And nothing more important or significant than the Department of Defense. This person, the Secretary of Defense, […] the person that, except for the President, leads our men and women in the military and our civilian employees, about 3.5 million of them; manages about an $800 billion budget. We need that person to be strong, to be respected. And I can tell you after the answers that Mr. Hegseth gave today, he is unqualified for the job, and I can tell you why. For years, he’s been on television. You played my clip before. Those were his words. He’s had opinions. He’s written books. And suddenly, suddenly, since he’s been nominated, he has changed his tune. 

Who is the real Pete Hegseth? What does he stand for? The person he has been, or the person since he’s been nominated? And once he’s confirmed, what can the American people expect? 

Dana Bash:  So just to put a fine point on it, it sounds like you are definitively voting against him in committee and then ultimately on the floor. 

Senator Rosen:  I do not feel that he is qualified to do this job.

10:56:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, met with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State. During their meeting, Senator Rosen emphasized her commitment to maintaining U.S. global leadership, strengthening international partnerships, growing our support for democratic allies, combating global antisemitism, and countering threats from adversaries. 

“For the last six years, I’ve worked closely with Senator Marco Rubio to support Israel and fight back against terrorists around the globe. Today, I was glad to meet with him to discuss his nomination to lead the State Department,”  said Senator Rosen.  “We both share a commitment to maintaining strong US leadership on the global stage. I plan to support Senator Rubio’s nomination and look forward to working with him to keep our nation safe.” 

Senator Rosen has been a strong leader in the push to support Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, and counter threats from Iran, Russia, and China. Following the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, Senator Rosen has repeatedly taken action to ensure Israel receives the unconditional support necessary to defend itself and defeat Hamas. She helped pass  critical aid  to support Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan and to respond to global humanitarian crises. Senator Rosen has been outspoken in  pushing  her own party to counter Iranian aggression, including by freezing its financial assets. She sent a  bipartisan letter  calling on President Biden to leverage the U.S. relationship with Qatar to secure the immediate release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and has  urged  the Administration to designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

10:57:03 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:57:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: MINNEAPOLIS, MN – Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), Ranking Member of the Senate Housing Subcommittee, announced an additional $5 million for the Twin Cities Metro area to assist with updating local zoning laws to build more affordable housing. The award will add to the $4 million previously  announced  in June 2024. The funding will provide technical support to cities and towns already in the process of updating their housing plans, community development strategies and best practices around zoning policy to incentivize more housing development. The funding will allow the Met Council to fully fund staff for the project through 2030. 

“We have to tackle our housing crisis at every level of government. Boosting the supply of housing is necessary to drive down costs, and that takes federal, state, local and private-sector coordination,”  said Senator Smith.  “Localities across the Metro have been working hard to reduce barriers to affordable housing and improve community development. This federal funding will support these efforts and further invest in the production and preservation of affordable housing in the region.” 

“Neighbors for More Neighbors celebrates this newly-awarded grant to the Metropolitan Council. Minneapolis has seen the positive impact of legalizing more housing types in neighborhoods across the city. We are confident that similar reforms, encouraged by this grant and undertaken across the Twin Cities metro area, will help everyone find secure, affordable homes in the neighborhoods they choose,”  said Anna Nelson, Board Chair at Neighbors for More Neighbors. 

Local zoning laws dictate where housing can be built and what kind of housing is permitted. Many zoning codes prohibit cheaper, multi-family housing projects such as apartment buildings, duplexes and triplexes, which makes it harder to increase the supply of housing by limiting the kinds of housing that can be built to just single-family homes. Cities with restrictive zoning laws tend to have higher  home prices  ,  rent growth  , and  levels  of  homelessness  than cities with more flexible zoning policies. 

Funding was awarded through the Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) program. The program was funded through the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which Senator Smith supported in Congress. Senator Smith urged appropriators to fund PRO Housing in a letter to Congressional appropriators and previously  led  a Housing Subcommittee hearing aimed at how to boost housing supply through innovative efforts such as zoning reform. 

Many cities and towns in the region are in the process of updating their zoning codes to support increased housing options, density and greater affordability. 

  * Roseville upzoned its municipal code to allow duplexes in zones that were previously designated exclusively for single-family units. 
  * Shoreview passed the first inclusionary zoning policy in Ramsey County. 
  * Richfield voted to reduce the minimum lot size and to allow duplexes citywide in January 2023. 
  * Bloomington adopted zoning proposals which reduced minimum lot size and allowed duplexes city wide. 



This funding will support other localities in the process of updating their local ordinances to better support new home construction.

This project will assess safety improvements at four railway crossings in La Crescent. The plan which will reduce the total number of crossings from four to three, which will improve safety for drivers and pedestrians through this corridor. Additionally, the project will involve the installation of protective devices, signals, and signage. 

“Blocked rail crossings not only inconvenience drivers, but also delay emergency vehicles and threaten public safety,”  said Klobuchar.  “This federal investment will reduce traffic, boost efficiency and improve rail crossing safety. Investments in our infrastructure serve as a down payment on the long-term economic well-being of our state.” 

“If we’re going to build an economy that works for everyone, then we need to prioritize investments in vital infrastructure like railroads to be more efficient and safer,”  said Senator Smith.  “These studies will help officials evaluate and improve rail crossings in La Crescent to protect residents. It’s a great investment to enhance community safety and I’m glad we were able to get it done.” 

This investment is made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which both Klobuchar and Smith supported and worked to pass. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorized USDOT’s Rail Crossing Elimination Grant Program (RCE), which provides funding for highway-rail and pathway-rail grade crossing improvement projects that improve the safety and mobility of people and goods. 

Klobuchar and Smith have both cosponsored the bipartisan  Railway Safety Act  . This legislation will make key updates to improve rail safety protocols, including increasing inspections on trains that carry hazardous materials, requiring rail carriers to have emergency response plans, and increasing penalties for rail companies when crashes happen.

ReConnect Rondo is a community-based organization in St. Paul working on a restorative development project to create a land bridge over the interstate to support economic growth and provide space for affordable housing, small businesses, parks, and more. The Rondo neighborhood is a center of the Black community in St. Paul and lost more than 1,000 homes and businesses when I-94 was built and divided the community. 

“Reconnecting communities strengthens our economy, makes our neighborhoods safer, and opens doors to opportunities,”  said Senator Klobuchar.  “The ReConnect Rondo project will revitalize this historic neighborhood, provide a safe crossing for pedestrians and cyclists, allow new homes to be built for families, and support local businesses.” 

“The Rondo Community Land Bridge is an opportunity for us to address the historical harm caused by transportation projects while creating opportunities for new economic development,”  said Senator Smith.  “This grant funding is an important step toward reconnecting the Rondo neighborhood, laying the groundwork for a future that honors its history while fostering new opportunities for growth and community development. I’m happy to be able to support this project as it moves forward.” 

“As a proud fifth-generation Rondo descendant, this investment is not just overdue—it is essential,”  said St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter.  “The Rondo Community Land Bridge is a powerful restoration of opportunity in the heart of Saint Paul. It serves as a bold step toward healing, ensuring that we build a future where all our neighborhoods are stronger and more connected.” 

“This grant marks a pivotal step forward for the Rondo community and our ongoing efforts to restore what was lost. We are deeply thankful to Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith for their unwavering advocacy and support of our vision. With this funding, we can take critical strides toward reigniting an African American Cultural Enterprise District, fostering economic opportunity, and honoring the rich legacy of Rondo,”  said Keith Baker, Executive Director of ReConnect Rondo. 

The grant funding from the Reconnecting Communities Pilot is made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Klobuchar and Smith supported and was signed into law in 2021. The Reconnecting Communities Pilot program is the first-ever federal program dedicated to reconnecting communities that were previously divided by transportation infrastructure.

10:57:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (both D-MN) announced two grants for Tribal communities in Minnesota to make several sections of highway safer and more accessible for travelers. 

“Rebuilding our infrastructure is critical for families, workers, and businesses everywhere–including in Tribal communities like Lower Sioux Indian Community and Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians,”  said Sen. Klobuchar.  “These infrastructure projects will create good jobs, support new businesses, and make traveling safer for drivers and pedestrians.” 

“If we’re going to build an economy that works for everyone, then we need to prioritize investments in vital infrastructure, like highways, that connect people with opportunities all across the state,”  said Sen. Smith. “  This federal grant will help improve safety on County State Aid Highway 2 and Minnesota State Highway 1, so that members of Lower Sioux and Red Lake Nation can get where they need to go safely. It’s great to see this significant federal investment and I’m going to keep fighting to bring federal dollars back to Minnesota.” 

Two Tribal Communities received grants: 

  * Lower Sioux Indian Community  will use a $25 million grant to reconstruct approximately ten miles of County State Aid Highway 2, construct a shared-use path, and construct an electric vehicle charging station. 
  * Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians  will use a $25 million grant to reconstruct approximately 1.2 miles of Minnesota State Highway 1, rehabilitate 4 miles of existing pavement on Walking Shield Road, and extend Walking Shield Road 5.6 miles to the east. Approximately 11 miles of shared use paths will also be constructed. Other improvements include widened shoulders, sidewalks, installation of street lighting, access improvements, cultural elements, culvert replacements, new guardrail, intersection enhancements including a new roundabout, and stormwater and drainage improvements. 



The grants were distributed as part of the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Program within the Department of Transportation. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Klobuchar and Smith supported, delivered a 50 percent increase in the amount of available funding for RAISE, which provides grants for surface transportation infrastructure projects with significant local or regional impact.

10:57:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  –  U.S. S  enator Peter Welch (D-Vt.)  today celebrated the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) announcement of $21.8 million in new emergency relief funding to the Vermont Agency of Transportation to help Vermont communities impacted by the July 2023 floods. The funding is allocated through DOT’s Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief Program and will reimburse the state for costs associated with repairing roads, bridges, and additional transportation infrastructure in Vermont damaged by catastrophic flooding in July 2023. Senator Welch has  championed  disaster and emergency relief funding for Vermont’s flood-stricken communities since the July 2023 floods, and helped craft the disaster aid bill passed by Congress in December. 

“In the aftermath of devastating floods, Vermont worked around the clock to repair damaged roads and bridges. State officials, including Vermont Agency of Transportation staff, have built back Vermont’s infrastructure quickly and more resiliently, often fronting significant costs to get the work done. This $21 million grant will help reimburse the state for these costs, and go a long way toward rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by flooding,”  said Senator Welch  . 

“Since 2023, Vermont has seen its fair share of severe weather, destroying roads, culverts, bridges, and infrastructure,”  said Governor Scott  . “This funding will help to make repairs and build back better and more resilient. I’m appreciative of Senator Welch’s support in bringing these resources to Vermont.” 

“When natural events challenge Vermont and its communities the Agency of Transportation leans in quickly and effectively to bring all the resources at its disposal to restoring mobility across all modes of transportation. These grant funds will support the efforts already undertaken and more longer-term fixes to come,”  said Vermont Agency of Transportation Secretary Flynn  .

10:57:16 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
10:57:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  –  U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.)  today celebrated the White House’s  announcement  that it has selected 15 additional prescription drugs for Medicare price negotiations. These newly announced prescription drugs—together with  ten drugs already negotiated  last year—represent nearly a third of all Medicare Part D spending on prescription drugs and treat conditions such as diabetes and cancer. These prescription drugs are subject to price negotiation under the  Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  , which Senator Welch helped pass as a member of the House of Representatives. Pharmaceutical companies have until February 28  th  to accept the offers or propose counteroffers. 

“Throughout their time in office, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have championed historic efforts to lower drug prices for our seniors, and this announcement today builds upon that legacy. The  Inflation Reduction Act  ’s drug pricing provisions are supported by red and blue states alike–with support from 85% of Americans–and will put around $1.5 billion back in the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries next year,”  said Senator Welch  . “The federal government has an obligation to care for its citizens, and that commitment must continue in the next administration. We’ll keep fighting against Big Pharma’s greedy tactics and work to deliver savings for patients in Vermont and across America.” 

The 15 new drugs selected today  include  : 

  * Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy, for Type 2 diabetes. 


  * Trelegy Ellipta, an asthma treatment. 


  * Xtandi, for prostate cancer. 


  * Pomalyst, a chemotherapy drug. 


  * Ibrance, a breast cancer drug. 


  * Ofev, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 


  * Linzess, a chronic constipation drug. 


  * Calquence, a cancer drug. 


  * Austedo; Austedo XR, for Huntington’s disease. 


  * Breo Ellipta, a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drug. 


  * Tradjenta, a diabetes drug. 


  * Xifaxan, for diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome. 


  * Vraylar, an antipsychotic drug. 



Medicare’s drug price negotiation program, a major long-term cost-saving feature of the  Inflation Reduction Act  , grants Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for up to 60 medications to help make life-saving drugs more affordable to patients. Provisions from Sen. Welch and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)’s  bill to end the ban on Medicare negotiating lower prescription drug prices  for Medicare’s 50 million seniors, introduced during Welch’s tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, were incorporated into the legislation. 

Senator Welch has  urged federal courts  to uphold the constitutionality of the  Inflation Reduction Act  ’s drug pricing provisions. Last Congress, Sens. Welch and Klobuchar introduced the  Strengthening Medicare and Reducing Taxpayer (SMART) Prices Act  to build on the success of the  Inflation Reduction Act  to increase the number of drugs eligible for negotiation and enhance the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

10:57:17 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – While questioning  witnesses  during the second day of the confirmation hearing for U.S. Attorney General Nominee Pamela Bondi,  U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.)  questioned legal and ethics experts, as well as former colleagues of Ms. Bondi, about the pressure she will face to pursue the President-elect’s political adversaries—especially after the Supreme Court’s immunity decision has put the powers of the president above the law. 

As Senator Welch outlined in his remarks, it has been the tradition of the Justice Department since the Watergate Scandal to create a firewall between DOJ and the White House. Despite this historical norm, Donald Trump has a pattern of using his power as president to pressure his previous Attorneys General to go after his opponents. 

Watch the exchange  here  :

Welch opened his line of questioning with the following remarks:  “The questions that I have are less about her and her qualifications, but more about this questions that looms out there. There is a mutual concern about not using the justice system for political reasons. And there’s a point of view with my Republican colleagues, it has been used that way in the prosecutions against Donald Trump—I don’t agree with that, but I hear them on that. And there is a concern on my part, and I think a lot of others, that Donald Trump has made very explicit statements that he intends to pursue political adversaries. And he has named them, including my colleague Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney. He will be a president who enjoys the benefit of the immunity decision by the Supreme Court. I strongly disagree with that decision. I don’t think anybody is above the law. That is the whole basis upon which our country was founded. 

“But, I take him seriously when he says he wants a prosecutor to go after his political adversaries. The tradition in the Justice Department, since Watergate, has been to really create a near-firewall between the Administration, Executive and the Justice Department, because of its special role. You are law enforcement, so you know how awesome the power is that you have so you have to have restraint as well as aggression. How does an Attorney General handle a president who has already put an immense amount of pressure on Bill Barr, one of his Attorneys General, and who did it on Mr. Sessions? And shouldn’t we take seriously President Trump’s threat that he’s going to go after his political adversaries, and how do we deal with that and assess that in terms of this decision?” 

Mary McCord, Executive Director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center, testified:  “As we know, in the first Trump Administration Attorney General Sessions made the decision to recuse himself from the Russia Investigation because of his work with Donald Trump during the campaign and because of meetings he had had with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign. He recognized the appearance of impropriety and the need for independence. He also appointed a Special Counsel to take over that investigation.   
  
“Those are the kind of steps that are required when there could be pressure. And there  was  pressure put on Attorney General Sessions, indeed forever after that recusal decision, he fell out of favor with the President and ultimately was fired. But those are the things that an independent Attorney General needs to take seriously, needs to do, to demonstrate that commitment to independence from political influence.” 

Welch responded:  “What’s difficult here is that none us know—whoever is in that job and is confronted by a very-determined President Trump to do something that from the prosecution point-of-view might not be appropriate…political prosecution of an adversary for payback… 

“There’s no way to know how any of us, as committed as we are, would be able to withstand that pressure.”

10:57:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: Bessent Agrees to Work with Welch on Credit Card Swipe Fees 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – In his first Senate Finance Committee hearing today,  Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.)  questioned Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be the Secretary of the United States Treasury Department, about the affordability crisis and the need for the incoming administration to work with Democrats to extend tax credits to help all Americans access affordable health care, child care, and housing. Senator Welch also pushed Bessent to support small businesses and consumers by avoiding protectionist trade policies and asked for his commitment to take on high credit card swipe fees. 

Watch the exchange  between Senator Welch and Scott Bessent, President-elect Trump’s pick to be Treasury Secretary: 

Read selections of the exchange below: 

Senator Welch asked Treasury Secretary Nominee Bessent  : “The situation for a lot of Vermonters, who work incredibly hard, is very tough. Vermont actually has one of the widest, if not the widest gap, between what people can earn and what their expenses are. So, it’s tough at the end of the month to pay all the bills: the grocery bills, the health care bills, all of these things…My hope is that whatever tax policy we have is going to start with a commitment to making lives better for the Main Street folks that you mentioned, and I’m glad that you did. 

“But there is going to be a lot of negotiation on how to pay for these tax cuts, and one of the things that’ll be on the block is something that’s very, very important for Vermonters, and that’s the Affordable Care Act Tax Credits that we have now. So, in Vermont, health care is incredibly expensive for everybody. But if we have, just as an example: an electrician in Bennington, Vermont, who’s making $67,000 a year, with the tax credits that are set to expire, that family would have a $700 a month increase in their health care bill. That’s going to hammer them, like $9,000. So, my question to you is, in putting together this tax proposal—where you are going to have to be making recommendations about how to pay for it—will we continue to provide this help to Vermonters—like this electrician in Bennington—so he doesn’t get hammered on health care premiums going well beyond what he can afford?” 

Scott Bessent, Treasury Secretary Nominee replied  : “Senator, as we discussed in your office, I haven’t had time to do my homework on this…I will get up to speed—if confirmed, I will get up to this.” 

Sen. Welch continued  : “I appreciate that, but there’s a couple of things that really make a difference for working Americans in South Carolina and in Vermont. The Child Tax Credit, you know, when we had that it reduced poverty for children by 50%. That’s really elemental for hardworking families. 

“Second, on the tariffs…I’m concerned about the impact of tariffs on Canada, and what that does to us in Vermont. Our major business export partner is Canada, and from what we have seen, it would raise a cost to businesses, probably cost jobs, and cost to consumers. So, what reassurance can we get from the Trump Administration that there’s going to be a ‘do no harm’ policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with the tariff policy?” 

Mr. Bessent  : “Senator, very difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially. But in terms of working Americans, I believe that President Trump understands that it’s working America—he had a very unique coalition. I think he understands that it’s the affordability crisis.” 

Sen. Welch  : “I hope the policy will reflect that. So, I appreciate the opportunity to work together with you on that. Just the last thing—we were talking about credit card rates for consumers. Credit card fees for our small businesses are the highest in the whole world—the highest in the whole world. Why can’t we bring them down and pay what Europe pays? Our small businesses, it’s the second or third highest expense for them. And you’ll have some impact there. But those costs on our small businesses…I’d like to get them down and get your help in doing that.” 

Mr. Bessent:  “I look forward to working with you on this issue if confirmed.”

10:57:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today,  U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  questioned U.S. Attorney General Nominee Pamela Bondi about high costs of health care in rural America, specifically referencing  recent reports  detailing how insurers have cheated taxpayers out of billions of dollars, including in Vermont. Ms. Bondi assured Senator Welch that, if confirmed, she would work to combat scams and protect consumers from rip-offs. 

Watch the exchange  between Senator Welch and Pam Bondi, President-elect Trump’s pick to be Attorney General: 

“In Vermont, there are incredible challenges for folks trying to get health care. It’s really expensive. And there was a shocking report in the  Wall Street Journal  about a major insurer that is ripping off taxpayers by overbilling, overprescribing on Medicare Advantage—billions of dollars. The report indicated that insurers are adding diagnoses basically to make money, not to help the patient. That insurers sent nurses to find diagnoses that doctors didn’t find. That insurers got paid to cover patients who were already getting their coverage through the VA. And it adds up to billions of dollars. 

“Vermonters are struggling under the weight of incredibly expensive health care. The  False Claims Act  Senator Grassley authored is an area where the Attorney General can protect consumers against rip-offs…I want your assurance that in addition to fighting crime—and we’re all in favor of you doing that—you’re going to be there protecting consumers and taxpayers from rip-offs,”  said Senator Welch  . 

Pam Bondi, Attorney General Nominee, responded  : “Absolutely, Senator. When I was Attorney General, we went after a pharmaceutical company—it was Medicaid fraud. I can’t remember the settlement value, it may even be ongoing, but it was a large, large number. People don’t understand that’s hurting the taxpayers, of Florida, of Vermont.” 

Senator Welch concluded  :  “So, use that  False Claims Act  that we can thank Senator Grassley for. It’s cold out there in Vermont—we need vigorous enforcement to protect taxpayers and Vermonters from rip-off charges.”

His own words, for instance, says that if he’s elected he’d seek to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Joe Biden. I assume you’ve had no discussion with President-elect Trump about that?” 

Bondi  : “Absolutely not, nor against Senator Schiff.” 

Welch  : “My colleague, Senator Schiff, who I think did an incredibly good job—President Trump had different views about that where he said on a number of occasions that everybody on the January 6 committee should be prosecuted for their lies and treason. No discussion about that? And Liz Cheney also, he said that she should be prosecuted for lies and treason as well.” 

Bondi  : “No, Senator…We have had no discussions about Liz Cheney.” 

Welch  : “You’ve satisfied me that this is not an agenda you have. President Trump has satisfied me that when he says things that are pretty provocative, he’s often serious. Now, Senator Cruz wants what I want and that is to have a Justice Department that is not going after people on the basis of them being political opponents. And my understanding, in listening to your answers to questions along this line, is that you have no intention—no intention of pursuing people on the basis of them being a political opponent.” 

Bondi  : “No one will be prosecuted, investigated because they are a political opponent. That’s what we’ve seen for the last four years in this administration. People will be prosecuted based on the facts, and the law, and fairly, Senator.” 

Welch  : “Alright, that’s good. I disagree about the characterization of the past four years. But we don’t have to discuss that with the assurance that the next four years there will be no effort on the part of the Justice Department to pursue political adversaries—right?” 

Bondi  : “Every case will be done on a case-by-case basis. No one should be prosecuted for political purposes. Absolutely not.”

10:57:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand issued the following statement regarding President Biden declaring that the Equal Rights Amendment has been ratified and is the law of the land: 

“I want to praise President Biden for declaring that the Equal Rights Amendment is now a valid part of the Constitution. I am in full agreement with his argument, given that the ERA has met every requirement laid out in Article V of the Constitution. This fact, together with the president’s proclamation and the backing of numerous legal experts, makes it clear that the ERA must now be considered the law of the land. This is an important day for reproductive freedom and a historic day for equality. 

Now, millions of women living in states with restrictions on their reproductive freedoms can file lawsuits to overturn these unconstitutional laws that discriminate against people based on their sex. I urge them to do so, and I know they’ll have abundant support for these efforts. 

Our opponents will doubtless challenge us in court. But there is strong legal backing for our position, including from the American Bar Association, which has urged federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments to implement the 28th Amendment. The time for procedure is over—we must now move to implementation.” 

Senator Gillibrand has been leading the effort to enshrine the Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution. Throughout 2024, Gillibrand  met with top officials in the Biden administration  pushing the president to take action on the ERA. In November, she led a group of forty-six senators in a letter to President Biden, urging him to seize the initiative on the issue. Last month, Gillibrand penned a  piece in the  New York Times  laying out the theory behind her arguments. The  New York Times  podcast “The Daily”  published an episode  last month recounting her efforts. 

A full library of ERA resources, including expert analysis from top legal scholars, the ABA resolution, and amicus briefs from nearly two dozen attorneys general, can be found at  gillibrand.senate.gov/eranow  .

10:57:29 root         DEBUG    Desc: In light of California’s devastating wildfires and the increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters across the country, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand held a virtual press conference to call for robust state-federal cooperation to ensure that New York is fully prepared to respond to wildfires and other threats. Gillibrand is committed to delivering any necessary federal resources to the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation to support their critical work training firefighters, managing New York’s forests, and educating the public on fire safety. 

“  While New York has so far been spared severe destruction from wildfires, these types of disasters are nevertheless becoming increasingly common in our state and throughout the East Coast,”  said Senator Gillibrand.  “As our climate crisis worsens, we must be prepared. Today, I am committing to delivering any necessary federal resources to help New York proactively prepare for wildfires and related threats. I look forward to cooperating closely with state government and our brave firefighters.” 

The full text of Senator Gillibrand’s letter to the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services is available  here  or below: 

The Honorable Jackie Bray 

Commissioner 

Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services 

1220 Washington Avenue 

State Office Campus 

Building 7A, Suite 710 

Albany, NY 12226 

Dear Commissioner Bray, 

I am writing today to inquire about the preparedness of New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) and its partners to combat potential wildfires in New York State. Climate change has exacerbated the unpredictability of weather conditions and natural disasters. New York has experienced several natural disasters in recent years, including wildfires, tornadoes, snowstorms, and flooding, and it is critical New York is prepared for the potential of unpredictable weather patterns that may lead to economic losses or loss of life. 

With increased periods of drought in New York State, it is increasingly important that New York is prepared to handle naturally occurring or accidental wildfires. The Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, as well as the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), do an excellent job at training firefighters, providing technical assistance to communities, and managing New York’s forests to prevent the spread of wildfires in our state. 

In the wake of the devastation of the ongoing wildfires in California, I am profoundly saddened by the loss of life, homes, and communities. Also considering recent wildfires in New York, such as the Jennings Creek Fire, it is important that New York be proactive in its fire prevention programs through public education, forest management, and government preparedness. I am reaching out to request a briefing from your team on the following topics: 

  1. What are the preparedness plans for the DHSES and the Office of Fire Prevention and Control in the face of increasing fire threats? 
  2. How does DHSES coordinate with NYSDEC to consider climate change impacts on wildfire preparedness? 
  3. What support can the federal government provide to bolster the work of the Office of Fire Control and Prevention to ensure New York is prepared for potential fires? 



I look forward to learning more about your plans and the support you provide New York State in the face of increasing wildfire threats. I stand ready to assist you in your vital prevention and preparedness work, and I am committed to ensuring New Yorkers and all Americans are able to recover from these types of natural disasters.

Watch here. 

Senator Gillibrand’s remarks as prepared for delivery below: 

Thank you, Chairman Scott. 

I am excited to serve as ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging for the 119  th  Congress. 

First, I want to thank Senators Casey and Braun for their committee leadership during the 118  th  Congress. The committee examined many important issues and I’m ready to continue that work as ranking member. 

Senator Scott, congratulations on your position as chair of this committee. I look forward to working closely with you during this Congress. 

I’m also pleased to welcome both new and returning committee members. I am eager to hear your perspectives and work with you to solve issues that older adults, people with disabilities, and their families face. 

The Aging Committee has a long history of bipartisanship. I hope we continue that tradition to advance an agenda that makes sure our loved ones can age with the support they need and with dignity and respect. 

This Congress, I hope to continue working to lower prescription drug costs, guard against financial scams, and protect the programs that older adults and people with disabilities rely on, such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. 

Today, we are discussing how to promote wellness among older adults. We’ll address issues like accessible housing, financial security, and engagement with the community. 

This conversation is about making sure that we are creating and supporting a society that gives people the tools to live and age well. 

Those tools are different for everyone, but include resources like nutrition assistance programs, Area Agencies on Aging, Centers for Independent Living, supportive housing programs, Medicare and Medicaid, and Social Security. 

I believe that it is our job to make sure these resources exist and are robust enough to support all who need them. 

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and discussing ways to improve wellness for older adults and people with disabilities.

USTR’s last-minute effort to neuter Trump’s USMCA   
By: Senators Bill Hagerty, Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville   
January 13, 2025   
Link  here  . 

The Biden administration jeopardizes American national and economic security   
  
In its waning hours, the Biden administration is working overtime to remind Americans why they voted for President-elect Donald Trump, whether it’s pardons of heinous criminals or destructive American energy restrictions.   
  
One of the most harmful yet underreported measures is an effort by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to lock in before Jan. 20 a difficult-to-reverse trade proposal that would (1) Reward Mexico’s government for violating the legal rights of American companies while (2) Jeopardizing construction of U.S. roads and bridges and (3) Potentially handing a key strategic port in the Gulf of Mexico to the Chinese Communist Party or other bad actors.   
  
This appalling surrender of U.S. interests must be halted.   
  
Specifically, the Biden administration wants to finalize a new binding re-interpretation of our trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that would snuff out U.S. companies’ ongoing trade claims regarding unlawful actions by foreign governments. 

Consider the impact on the case of Vulcan Materials, an Alabama-based company that has supplied crushed limestone—specifically available near its deep-water port on the Yucatan Peninsula—for decades to build infrastructure from Texas to Florida and the Carolinas.   
  
Yet since 2018, the Mexican government led by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and, more recently, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has escalated an unlawful campaign to shut down Vulcan’s operations and seize its property, including the firm’s strategically located deep-water port. Mexico has asserted shifting pretextual claims for this action, but it’s ultimately about taking control of Vulcan’s property.   
  
Vulcan rightly brought trade arbitration claims against Mexico under the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its successor United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It is on the cusp of potentially being awarded substantial compensation. However, USTR’s last-minute effort to neuter the USMCA’s Annex 14-C would eliminate the heart of Vulcan’s case against Mexico.   
  
Even serious trade thinkers on the right with misgivings about ISDS recognize that there are instances where it advances American interests. They certainly wouldn’t support an agreement that changes the rules, ex post facto, to support another nation’s effort to vitiate an American company’s justified legal claim.   
  
It’s bad enough that the Biden administration is siding with a foreign government that is bullying American businesses. More profoundly, however, this measure would jeopardize American national and economic security.   
  
Vulcan’s port—the only deep-water port on the Yucatan Peninsula—is a key access point to the Gulf of Mexico and ports throughout the southern U.S. Its strategic importance is enormous.   
  
Losing control of this port—the only one in the region capable of accommodating the large vessels needed to efficiently transport essential construction materials to the U.S.—and the nearby limestone quarry would imperil thousands of connected American jobs in construction, shipping, and related industries and hamstring the construction of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure in America.   
  
It also raises the question of who could gain access to or control of this port after Mexico’s seizure.   
  
Over the past decade, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative has prioritized the acquisition of geopolitically significant ports—ostensibly for commercial purposes but often for dual commercial and military use. China now owns or operates nearly 100 ports in over 50 countries, especially in locations with critical trade or strategic value. China’s involvement in ports on either side of the Panama Canal—a vital artery for global trade—highlights its ambitions.   
  
The CCP, no doubt, has its sights set on this Yucatan port if American control is extinguished.   
  
Beyond these military and strategic considerations, the Justice Department recently indicted Chinese companies for supplying fentanyl precursors to criminal elements in Mexico. At a time when deadly fentanyl is killing over 70,000 Americans each year, facilitating CCP ambitions in America’s backyard could have catastrophic consequences for American communities.   
  
America’s government must protect American interests. Congress should pass the Defending American Property Abroad Act to prohibit vessels that utilize expropriated U.S. infrastructure from entering American ports, thereby discouraging trade partners from taking advantage of us.   
  
However, the outgoing Biden administration must abandon this disastrous trade proposal. Failure to do so will create an enduring legacy of emboldening foreign governments to exploit American businesses and creating serious economic and national security vulnerabilities for the homeland.

Partial Transcript    
  
Hagerty on the Southern California fires:  “At this point, we still don’t know the full extent of the damage, and we may not know for some time. But what we can see is the failure of policy there and the failure of leadership in California that’s been egregious. Whether it’s [Governor] Gavin Newsom prioritizing some sort of obscure fish over his citizens, or whether it’s a leader like [Mayor] Karen Bass, the mayor there, who prioritizes DEI initiatives over the readiness of first responders. It’s absolutely pathetic what has happened there, and I think we’re going to have to have real accountability. We need to have hearings to understand, to get to the bottom of what’s taken place, what the failures have been. When we get a new FEMA director in, when Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk take a hard look at how we efficiently deploy, how we effectively deploy resources here, we’re going to have to see some very real changes. I hope California wakes up. Certainly, this White House hasn’t woken up. Joe Biden flies out for a photo op and shut down the airspace, grounding the helicopters that were responsible for putting the fires out, just so he can brag about being a grandfather. Talk about being out of touch, whether it’s the President, and whether it’s Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass, we’ve got to bring accountability to bear here. And before we put funds into place, we’ve got to find out exactly how we’re going to hold these leaders accountable and what sort of policy changes are required […] And I think [the amount of funding needed] may continue to rise. You know, one of the concerns I’ve got is that from a policy standpoint, California came in and basically inserted Marxist price controls on the insurance industry there. What does that lead to? Well, of course, that led to the exit of private sector insurers. So, many of the people that I’ve spoken with over the course of this week in Southern California are either uninsured or underinsured. This pain is going to be felt by the taxpayers, by the rate payers there for some time to come. And if you think about the time to rebuild, given the heat that has been rolling through these neighborhoods, the intensity of the fires, the destruction, I talked to an insurance executive early this morning that told me about the contamination of the soil that’s going to have to be remediated. And if you’re in the Palisades, you have to deal with the coastal commission permitting there, [which] will take years. This is going to be devastating. It will take a very long time to rebuild; significant policy changes are going to be required here.”   
  
Hagerty on Congress’ role in implementing Trump’s agenda:  “Maria, when I saw that interview between you and [Speaker] Mike [Johnson] last week, I was very pleased to see the pace of play that he’s got in mind. We need to be moving expeditiously. When the Senate met with President Trump this week, there was a very unifying meeting there. We talked about the various strategies to get there. The main point is we need the entirety of this agenda implemented as quickly as possible. We need to get our border repaired. We need to get back into the energy business. We need to extend the tax cuts so that we don’t see the most massive tax hike in history. We’ve got to get this done quickly, and I think all of my colleagues understand this. We’re going to work night and day to make certain that that happens.”   
  
Hagerty on the need to quickly confirm Trump’s cabinet:  “I think the most important aspect of this, Maria, is the fact that we need to move quickly. And if my colleagues don’t grasp the gravity of this, just look at the crises happening in California right now. Look at what’s happening around the globe from a national security standpoint. Our border is still collapsed. We have very urgent crises that have to be dealt with. President Trump needs his cabinet in place right now. So, my greatest concern is that the Democrats don’t use procedural opportunities to slow us down. We need to be moving quickly. Every one of these cabinet nominees needs to get a fair hearing, and we need to get them in place as quickly as possible, so President Trump can move now. You’ve seen President Trump make many, many steps already to be ready to go and hit the ground, on January the 20th, running. And we need to have his cabinet in place to support all of that.”   
  
Hagerty on Trump’s executive orders on day one:  “There are a number of things he can do with executive orders right away, for example, to deal with the crisis at the southern border. But we need legislative action as well to help fund these activities, to make certain that he’s got every arrow in his quiver that’s available to make certain that we get America safe again—we bring crime down, we get our economy moving full board, and we get back into the energy business.”   
  
Hagerty on the Biden Administration allowing Mexico to seize Vulcan Materials Company’s assets:  “I’ve absolutely been zeroed in on this, Maria. It’s an absolute shame what Joe Biden is willing to do. So much for a smooth transition. He’s trying to make it as difficult as possible, not only for the incoming Trump Administration, but for the American economy and for the private sector. And whether it’s banning our ability to have gas water heaters, or barring lands that can be used for exploration, or freeing criminals without any sort of concern for the families who’ve been forever scarred and marred by what they’ve done. Joe Biden is taking every opportunity to wage war on the American economy and on the private sector. So, in this case, you’ve got Vulcan Materials, an iconic American company, that has used American dollars to build a massive quarry operation and a deep-water port. For decades, they’ve been operating. What America needs to do is stand up for its private sector. What Mexico has done is stepped in and stolen this property. It’s expropriated it. And what the Biden Administration is doing here, at the 11th hour, is trying to hand this over to Mexico. It’s amazing that they would let the Mexican government come in and expropriate a strategic deep-water port that I’m certain if Mexico is able to get this for nothing, it will become for sale to the highest bidder. It could be a crown jewel in China’s Belt and Road [Initiative]. And if you think about the criticality of the stone that comes from that port, we rely on this in the entirety of the southeastern United States to build our infrastructure. What Biden wants to do is allow Vulcan Materials to be crushed by the Mexican government, again, with impunity. This type of thing, at the 11th hour, just underscores the fact that this Administration and the radical left believe in central government control of every asset. They’re happy to surrender our sovereignty, to surrender the rights of the U.S. private sector, in order to see central control, even if it’s in the hands of an unfriendly government, like Mexico, that has allowed fentanyl across the border, has allowed criminals to come into our country, that has allowed the mass influx of 10 million, 15 million or more, to completely invade our country during the Biden Administration. They’re going to reward the Mexican government for this. I’m going to spend every moment I can this next week to try to stop them in the 11th hour, so this does not happen in America.”

USBR also announced $18 million from the IRA for drought mitigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. 

WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet celebrated the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR)  announcement  of up to $152 million in federal funding for 17 projects in Colorado to combat the Colorado River crisis, increase drought resiliency, and restore habitats. The federal funding comes from the  Inflation Reduction Act  , which included $4 billion to mitigate the impacts of drought, including activities to support environmental benefits and promote ecosystem and habitat restoration. 

“We passed our historic  Inflation Reduction Act  to tackle the long-term aridification of the West head-on,”  said Hickenlooper.  “That’s exactly what these new federal investments do. They’ll preserve historical Colorado River flows, help manage drought impacts on Upper Basin ecosystems, and improve water supply resiliency on the Upper Rio Grande.” 

“The Inflation Reduction Act provided historic funding to address drought, restore the health of our watersheds, and invest in the future of the American West. I’m glad the Biden-Harris administration answered our calls to support the water security of critical basins across the state from the Rio Grande Basin to Southwest Colorado,”  said Bennet.  “This funding will also bring us one step closer to securing the Shoshone water right on the Colorado River fulfilling a long-standing goal of Coloradans to protect the environmental, economic, and agricultural resources of the State’s namesake river.” 

The 17 projects will receive up to $152 million in funding from the USBR’s Upper Colorado River Basin Environmental Drought Mitigation program, referred to as “Bucket 2E”. In addition to that funding, the USBR also announced $18 million from the IRA for drought mitigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. 

The announcements come after the lawmakers sent letters to USBR in support of several of the projects. In particular, Hickenlooper and Bennet  urged  USBR to support the Colorado River Water Conservation District’s (CRWCD) application for federal funding to purchase two of the oldest water rights on the Colorado River mainstem in Colorado, known as the Shoshone Permanency Project. The Shoshone Permanency Project will benefit the Colorado River ecosystem every year, and especially in dry years. 

Hickenlooper and Bennet fought for $8 billion for western water infrastructure, $10 billion for forests, $19 billion for agricultural conservation, and $4 billion for drought in the  Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  and  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  .

10:57:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: Hickenlooper-cosponsored amendments would’ve secured a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and increased funding for border security 

WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper released the following statement after he voted against the  Laken Riley Act  : 

“This country needs a serious conversation on immigration,”  said Hickenlooper.  “The amendments we introduced were real solutions to problems with our broken immigration system. They would have provided DREAMers a pathway to citizenship, and also dramatically expanded our farm workforce. None were given a vote. I cannot support an unamended version of this bill.” 

The  Laken Riley Act  would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals who have been charged or arrested (even if not convicted) for theft crimes, including shoplifting. 

As written, the  Laken Riley Act  raises significant concerns. The bill has no protections for children and minors. It would mandate that kids, without having been found guilty of a crime, could be detained indefinitely and separated from their families. 

The legislation would also let any state attorneys general sue the federal government over a wide range of immigration-related actions. Any immigration policy from either party would be paralyzed from going into effect as it gets held up in litigation. The legislation would undermine federal immigration enforcement and could deny due process to DACA recipients, certain TPS holders, and many undocumented individuals by subjecting them to detention without court proceedings or a conviction. To enforce this legislation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would also need an additional 118,500 beds and an increase in staff in detention centers, with no funding appropriated by Congress to comply with this need. Estimates place the cost of enforcing the  Laken Riley Act  at $83 billion for the next three years. ICE has concluded that the bill is “impossible to execute with existing resources.” 

Hickenlooper voted to open debate on the legislation to allow Senators to introduce amendments to the bill. 

Hickenlooper introduced and cosponsored several amendments to the  Laken Riley Act  , including: 

  * Hickenlooper-led amendment  to give standing to state attorney generals when DHS violates constitutional rights, including due process 


  * Dream and Promise Act  :  Adds bipartisan legislation to provide a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, and Deferred Enforced Departures (DED) holders 


  * Comprehensive fixes to the  Laken Riley Act  :  Strikes the overbroad and likely unconstitutional provision that would give state attorney generals standing to sue the federal government on immigration policies they dislike. The amendment would also add language to protect children from mandatory detention, provide due process, and use limited detention resources wisely by focusing on dangerous individuals 


  * DREAM Act & Affordable + Secure Food Act  :  Provides a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, provides temporary status provisions for certified agricultural workers, and reforms the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker program by providing H-2A visas for year-round jobs for the first time and modernizing the application process 


  * Funding to disrupt criminal activity at the border:  Increases the amount appropriated to disrupt criminal activity at the border, including $1B to increase drug interdiction at the border and $233M to expand efforts to interdict fentanyl 


  * Increase in border security technology:  Would require border security technology to be piloted, tested, and deployed at our northern and southern borders

District of Columbia’s Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the bill in the House of Representatives. The bills are numbered S. 51 and H.R. 51, respectively, highlighting the lawmakers’ effort to admit Washington, D.C. into the Union as its 51st state.

Colorado airports have already received $518 million in BIL funding 

WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet celebrated $20 million in additional Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve 12 airports across Colorado. 

“Colorado’s airports drive our economy and connect our state,”  said Hickenlooper.  “These Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments will strengthen our economy and make air travel both easier and safer.” 

“These investments will help airports improve safety and expand capacity to get Coloradans where they need to go,”  said Bennet.  “It is another example of how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law keeps delivering for our state.” 

The investments are funded through the FAA’s  Airport Infrastructure Grants (AIG) program  , which delivers funding for airports nationwide to improve runways, taxiways, and airport signage, lighting, marking, and facilities. The program receives funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which  Hickenlooper helped negotiate  . The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has provided over $518 million to Colorado airports across the state for infrastructure improvements since being signed into law.

10:57:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: Bill paves the way for more generic drugs to come to market 

WASHINGTON –  Last week, U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper, Tom Cotton, Peter Welch, and Susan Collins reintroduced the bipartisan  Skinny Labels, Big Savings Act  , a bill designed to lower drug prices by accelerating the roll-out of generic drugs and creating legal protections from endless lawsuits for generic drug manufacturers who obtain “skinny label” FDA approvals. The senator previously  introduced  the legislation in the 118th Congress. 

“Patients face higher prices because big pharma has cornered the market and locked out new competitors,”  said Hickenlooper.  “Our bill encourages the competition we so desperately need. Generic drug manufacturers will help lower the cost of life-saving medication.” 

“Generic drugs lower costs and provide options for patients. Our legislation will ensure more of them come to market by clarifying generic companies that comply with FDA requirements are not subject to unnecessary lawsuits,”  said Cotton. 

“In Vermont and across the country, hardworking families are burdened with astronomical health care costs–including for lifesaving prescription drugs. So-called skinny labeling has helped level speed generics to market, bringing down costs in the process. It’s no surprise Big Pharma has a big problem with it,”  said Welch.  “This bill will protect skinny labeling and help patients pay less at the pharmacy counter.”   
  
“This bipartisan legislation will promote generic drug competition and improve patient access to lower-cost medications,”  said Collins.  “By reaffirming the so-called ‘skinny label’ pathway, this bill will help patients and taxpayers save money on prescription drugs.” 

Brand-name drug manufacturers often use  groups of patents  to establish ownership over their drug and reduce market competition. These patents make it difficult to bring generics to market, resulting in higher drug costs for patients. 

To help speed up generic competition, federal law permits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve generic and biosimilar drugs via a “skinny 

label” that leaves out indications – uses of the drug – that are still protected by patents. Hickenlooper’s bill would protect generic drug manufacturers who obtain FDA approval for skinny label indications from liability in patent infringement cases. 

Specifically, the bill would amend the federal patent infringement law so that generic drug manufacturers would be lawfully able to: 

  1. Submit or seek approval of a skinny label for a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product;   

  2. Labeling, promoting, or commercially marketing, consistent with the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  regulations, a drug with skinny labeling approved by the FDA;   

  3. Describe, consistent with the  Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,  a drug approved via skinny label as a generic of or therapeutic equivalent to the branded drug. 



Full text of the bill is available  HERE  . 

A one page explainer on the bill is available  HERE. 

“The Generics Access Project, a coalition of patient advocacy groups across disease states, applauds Senator Hickenlooper, Senator Cotton, Senator Collins, and Senator Welch for their proactive efforts to protect the skinny labeling of generic medicines – a critical pathway that has enabled timely patient access to high quality, affordable treatments for 40 years. Millions of patients rely on generic drugs that have been lawfully approved by the FDA with skinny labels. This safe harbor amendment is essential to ensuring the continued availability of generic medicines, ensure new generics are developed and helping bring affordable medicines to patients,  ” Gavin Clingham, Director of Public Policy for the Alliance for Patient Access. 

“Since the passage of Hatch-Waxman 40 years ago, skinny labeling has saved patients and the health care system billions of dollars annually,”  said John Murphy III, President and CEO for the Association of Accessible Medicines.  “Without hesitation, AAM applauds and supports legislation that will provide a safe harbor for skinny labeling, propelling patient access to lower-cost generic medications and protecting the overall health care system. Thank you to Senators Hickenlooper, Cotton, Welch, and Collins, as well as the committees of jurisdiction for their hard work on behalf of patients.” 

“CSRxP commends Senators Hickenlooper, Welch, Cotton and Collins for highlighting the importance of protecting and fostering robust competition from more affordable alternatives to high-priced brand name prescription drugs. Their legislation would help strengthen and protect the use of skinny labels that substantially reduce barriers to entry for generic drugs and save patients and the U.S. health care system billions of dollars — preventing Big Pharma from gaming the system to undermine the full value of this critical pathwa  y,” said Lauren Aronson, Executive Director of Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing. 

“The Skinny Labels, Big Savings Act preserves a crucial pathway for ensuring patients can continue to access affordable, life-saving generic medicines at prices they can afford,”  said Merith Basey, Executive Director of Patients For Affordable Drugs NOW.  “Major drug corporations routinely abuse the patent system to extend their monopolies, block competition and set exorbitant prices that harm patients. This legislation provides a counterweight by codifying legal protections for skinny labeling into law. It maintains incentives for generic entry by shielding skinny labels from patent challenges, increasing savings for patients and taxpayers. We urge Congress to pass this pro-competition, pro-patient bill – to keep reining in Big Pharma’s pricing abuses.”

10:57:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.—  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) today delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor: 

“I rise today in support of the Laken Riley Act. 

“Nearly a year ago, Laken Riley, a college girl more than a thousand miles from our southern border, was jogging on her university’s intramural fields. 

“Also more than a thousand miles from our southern border, an illegal criminal in our country brutally attacked and murdered her in broad daylight. 

“For 18 minutes Laken Riley, that young woman in the prime of her life with boundless potential, fought for her life against an assailant who never should have been in this country to begin with. 

“The Biden administration’s open border policies served the criminal’s depravity more than Laken and her family. 

“In fact, they served the criminal every bit as much as it failed Laken and her family. 

“Laken’s killer easily crossed our southern border with millions of others, and when he committed several crimes and was arrested, a Biden administration led-ICE made no effort to deport him. 

“Had he been appropriately prosecuted for his previous crimes, the Riley family would have celebrated Riley’s birthday instead of mourning an empty chair. 

“And February 22, 2024, would have been an ordinary day for their family instead of the worst day of their lives. 

“No family should face the nightmare Laken’s family endured, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to correct the glaring failures in our system that led to her tragic and preventable death. 

“The Laken Riley Act won’t bring Laken back, but it is a vehicle for turning the Riley family’s pain into purpose and partnering together to protect the American families. 

“This legislation’s sole goal is to hold known criminal illegal aliens accountable for their actions and enable states to bring civil charges against federal officials who failed to uphold our immigration laws. 

“Like all of us serving in this body, I came to the U.S. Senate because I wanted to make a positive difference for the American people. 

“This is one of those opportunities. 

“We have the ability to do that right now by getting this bill to the President’s desk. 

“Let’s honor Laken’s legacy by passing this bipartisan legislation to protect millions of Americans across our country. 

“Mr. President, I yield back.”

10:57:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.—  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) penned a letter to the Director of the United States Marshals Service expressing her urgent concern surrounding the Marshals Service’s plan to dispose of nearly 70,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road case. 

“The historical record of Bitcoin sales by the U.S. Marshals Service, resulting in over $17 billion in unrealized value for taxpayers, serves as a stark reminder of the cost of hasty liquidation decisions,”  Senator Lummis wrote.  “We cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. These Bitcoin represent an opportunity to diversify America’s assets and create a financial foundation that will benefit future generations. The decision to hold or sell these assets will reverberate far beyond this administration, potentially impacting our nation’s financial sovereignty and strategic position for decades to come.”

10:57:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: This week, Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) welcomed U.S. Senators John Curtis (R-UT) and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) to the Senate Western Caucus. 

“I am thrilled to welcome Senator Curtis and Senator Sheehy to the Senate Western Caucus,”  said Lummis.  “As new Senators from Utah and Montana, Senators Curtis and Sheehy will contribute greatly to the caucus goals of promoting western values in Washington. I am eager to partner with them on repealing the disastrous Biden-Harris policies that have decimated the west and increasing the power of western voices in the Senate.” 

“No state embodies the spirit of the American west better than Montana, which is why I’m proud to join my colleagues in the Western Caucus who are fighting to protect our shared heritage and values,”  said Sheehy.  “Together, we will stand up for farmers, ranchers, and hardworking families across the west who have been left behind by politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. and ensure our treaused way of life is protected.” 

“I’m so pleased to join the Senate Western Caucus and continue advocating for the values that define Utah– responsible land management, energy independence, and a commitment to preserving our natural resources for future generations,”  said Curtis.  “The west faces unique challenges and opportunities, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure our communities thrive.” 

The Senate Western Caucus is composed of 29 Senators west of the Mississippi committed to upholding the fundamental western principles of self-reliance, local decision-making, love of the land and the pioneer spirit.

10:57:57 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
10:57:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.–  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray jointly filed an  amici curiae  brief in the U.S. Supreme Court to block the implementation of the so-called  Corporate Transparency Act  and to protect Wyoming’s small businesses from its business-crushing regulatory burden. 

“The last thing business owners in Wyoming need after surviving four years of the Biden administration are more attacks on their small businesses, privacy and constitutional rights,”  said Lummis.  “Small businesses are the backbone of the Cowboy State, yet the federal government’s murky at best requirements are setting them up to fail, not thrive. I am partnering with Secretary Gray to defend our small businesses from this egregious overreach.” 

“I have been clear in my opposition to the CTA and its implementation, which is an unconstitutional intrusion hurting small business owners across our country, including Wyoming,”  said Gray.  “It is up to all levels of government to push back against unconstitutional intrusions, and I want to thank Senator Lummis and her team for partnering with us on this very important issue, and I hope the Supreme Court continues to block enforcement of the CTA.” 

Wyoming is a leading jurisdiction for corporate formation, offering businesses a stable and predictable regulatory framework, a climate this statute makes difficult to maintain. 

The statute requires the more than 32 million small businesses around the country to adhere to intrusive and unclear reporting requirements that most do not even know exist. This is especially punishing for businesses with fewer than 20 employees and $5 million or less in sales. Business owners who fail to comply, even unknowingly, could face up to $10,000 in civil penalties and/or criminal penalties with up to two years in prison.

“The brave men and women who return from serving our country should be able to receive the benefits promised to them. Military retirement pay and service-connected disability compensation are two completely different benefits. One does not diminish the merits of the other  ,"  said Bilirakis.

The 28th Amendment - the Equal Rights Amendment - guarantees all Americans equal rights and protections under the law."

“I have long stood with survivors of domestic violence, which is why I have been a strong supporter of the  Violence Against Women Act  . However, this Republican messaging bill would put domestic violence victims  at greater risk. 

“The bill restates current law; those who are convicted of or admit to committing crimes of domestic violence are already subject to deportation. Unfortunately, this legislation fails to include exemptions that have kept survivors of domestic violence safe. This will endanger and discourage victims of domestic violence, including legal migrants, from coming forward by allowing those who acted in self-defense or who were wrongly accused to be subject to the same deportation process. 

“That is why this legislation is opposed by the Coalition of Labor Union Women (AFL-CIO), the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Association of Social Workers, the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Women’s Law Center, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, YWCA USA and more than 200 local and national organizations that serve and work with victims of domestic violence. If Republicans were serious about addressing domestic violence, they would join Democrats and help us reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act  .”

10:58:09 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:58:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03), the Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and Workforce, submitted the following statement for the record on H.R. 28, the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act." 

I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. 

Before I discuss the substance of the bill, I want to express my frustration that this is the first education bill my colleagues have decided to focus on in the 119th Congress. Parents in my district sent me to Washington to tackle issues such as school shootings, teacher preparation, academic achievement gaps, and access to higher education. Instead of addressing these critical issues, my colleagues have opted to kick off the 119th Congress with a bill that prioritizes culture wars over student welfare. 

According to Congressional testimony from the NCAA, of the over 500,000 college athletes participating in NCAA sports, less than 10 are transgender. 

For over 100 years, organizations like the International Olympic Committee, the NCAA, and high school leagues have developed frameworks for transgender inclusion in sports. Those same organizations have not asked for Congressional help in dealing with this issue. They already know how to keep sports fair, safe, and inclusive. However, H.R. 28 does not achieve any of those goals. 

Sports are an invaluable part of the school experience. School sports activities offer fundamental life lessons—such as leadership, self-confidence, and teamwork—that every child should have the opportunity to experience. Regrettably, H.R. 28 threatens to rob children of this valuable experience. It seeks to single out students—some as young as kindergarten age—and ban them from participating in school sports with their friends. We know transgender students already face widespread bullying and discrimination, often leading to higher rates of depression and suicide. H.R. 28 would add to their pain by targeting their participation in school sports. This bill is both morally wrong and extremely dangerous for our children’s mental health and safety. 

Finally, despite the bill’s name, H.R. 28 would actually make school sports less safe for women and girls. What this bill should be called is the “Child Predator Empowerment Act.” This bill would require girls as young as four to face humiliating physical inspections of their private parts by adult strangers. Furthermore, the bill does not clarify who would be responsible for “inspecting” the girls’ private parts. 

Schools, sports organizations, and parents should make these decisions – not politicians in Washington attempting to use children as pawns in a political game. 

I therefore oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill as well.

WASHINGTON D.C.--  House Representatives Lauren Boebert (CO-04), Jeff Crank (CO-05), Gabe Evans (CO-08), and Jeff Hurd (CO-03) released a joint statement following reports of Colorado Parks & Wildlife importing Canadian gray wolves into Colorado over this past weekend: 

“After years of slighting or outright ignoring Colorado farmers and ranchers with politically appointed anti-agricultural activists and “meat-free days,” bureaucrats in Colorado have rushed through the importation of Canadian gray wolves and have set them loose in our state despite numerous protests and questions about the legality of this dysfunctional and chaotic approach. 

We are demanding answers from the Department of Interior  on why agencies like the Bureau of Land Management have failed to provide any evidence of statutorily required updates to Resource Management Plans to address the importation of wolves and how they will impact our agricultural producers, our sovereign Indian tribes, sportsmen, and our oil & gas producers across the state. With wolf numbers surging across the country, we stand united in support of  legislation like H.R. 130  (link is external)  to delist the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act and we urge the incoming Trump Administration to take immediate action by stopping further importation of these foreign predators into the United States. 

Colorado’s agricultural producers have lost $580,000 in just one year from wolves already introduced. We should be working with our farmers and ranchers who tirelessly labor to feed us, instead of hastily rushing foreign predators into our state and bloating even further a terribly mismanaged wolf program.” 

  
Background: 

  * Trust the Science Act  : Congresswoman Boebert has reintroduced her  Trust the Science Act  (link is external)  , which passed the House in April 2024 with bipartisan support, as H.R. 130 which removes the gray wolf from the endangered species list. This legislation allows individual states, like Colorado, to regain control over wolf management and respond to local needs without federal overreach. Delisting the gray wolf would empower stakeholders, ranchers, farmers, and tribes—to mitigate wolf attacks on livestock and address conflicts with land use. 
  * Resource Management Plans  : Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, federal agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are required to update RMPs to address new developments, such as Colorado’s wolf reintroduction. These plans are critical for resolving conflicts between wolves and land users, including ranchers, energy operators, and tribes. 
  * Canadian Wolves  and Rising Costs:  Colorado’s decision to bypass U.S. sources and import wolves from Canada raises legal and ethical concerns. Meanwhile, the state program has faced escalating costs and documented livestock attacks, leaving ranchers frustrated and compensation programs underfunded.

10:58:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:58:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, Representatives Dave Joyce (OH-14), Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Jen Kiggans (VA-02), and Lauren Underwood (IL-14) announced the relaunch of the Congressional Nursing Caucus. Congressman Joyce and Congresswoman Bonamici will serve as caucus co-chairs, with Congresswomen Underwood and Kiggans serving as the two vice-chairs. The Congressional Nursing Caucus is a bipartisan group of legislators dedicated to advancing policies to support the nation’s 4.2 million registered nurses. 

The Congressional Nursing Caucus is made up of over 50 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. This Congress, the Caucus will work to help address the nation’s nursing shortage, bolster the workforce pipeline, and provide nurses with the resources and tools they need to serve the millions of patients who rely on them. As healthcare providers across professions continue to retire at record-setting rates, the leaders of the Congressional Nursing Caucus recognize the invaluable role that nurses will continue to play in ensuring Americans have access to high quality and affordable healthcare  . 

“Our health care system couldn't function without the important work of nurses,”  said Congresswoman Bonamici.  “The care nurses provide for their patients every day is invaluable. But too many nurses in Oregon and across the country are facing unsustainable conditions at work because of a nursing workforce shortage, unsafe staffing levels, higher patient acuity, and other issues Congress can and should address. I am grateful to continue working with my colleagues as Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Nursing Caucus to advocate for the policies and resources nurses need to thrive.” 

“America’s nurses are the lifeline of our nation’s healthcare system,”  said Congressman Joyce.  “As the husband of a nurse, I am especially proud to once again serve as the co-chair of the Congressional Nursing Caucus, working alongside a strong team of bipartisan leaders who are determined to help address the challenges facing America’s nursing workforce. At a time when our nation faces a nursing workforce shortage, we must come together to bolster the workforce and support our nurses.” 

“As a geriatric nurse practitioner, I am proud to use my voice in Congress to advocate for my fellow nurses,”  said Congresswoman Kiggans.  “Nurses are invaluable members of our communities who truly understand what it means to serve others. As we face nursing shortages across the country, it is more important now than ever to ensure both nurses and nursing students have the support they need. I am proud to continue serving as vice chair of this important caucus and fighting for these amazing healthcare providers!” 

“Nurses are leaders in our communities and deserve meaningful support at every stage of their education, training, and careers,”  said Congresswoman Underwood.  “As a registered nurse, I couldn’t be more excited to continue my advocacy for nurses and serve as vice chair of the Congressional Nursing Caucus. We must make robust investments to grow the nursing workforce and make sure that every nurse can practice to the full extent of their training and education. I look forward to working with my colleagues to support nurses as they provide high-quality clinical care, engage in policy advocacy, and lead in their communities in Illinois and across the country.” 

“The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) is extremely grateful for the champions and partners we have on Capitol Hill in the Congressional Nursing Caucus,”  stated ACNM CEO Michelle Munroe, DNP, CNM, FACNM, FAAN  . “The Caucus’ critical work to increase access to evidence-based nursing and midwifery care helps drive innovation and improve maternal health outcomes. We look forward to working with the Congressional Nursing Caucus in the 119  th  Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that continues to improve and strengthen the lives of the families and communities that nurses and midwives serve.” 

“AACN applauds the return of the Congressional Nursing Caucus and their bipartisan work to address issues impacting nursing and the health of all Americans,”  said Dr. Deborah Trautman  ,  President and CEO of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.  “We are delighted to see Congressman Dave Joyce and Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici return as Co-Chairs and Congresswoman Lauren Underwood and Congresswoman Jen Kiggans, two of the nurses in Congress, return as Vice Co-Chairs. Their leadership and steadfast commitment to nursing education and research is critical, and we look forward to working with the Congressional Nursing Caucus in the 119th Congress as they support our nation's schools of nursing, faculty, and students." 

“Thank you to the Congressional Nursing Caucus for recognizing the vital role of nurses in delivering high-quality, patient-centered care,”  said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN, President of the American Nurses Association.  “The Caucus has been a crucial ally on Capitol Hill, advancing nursing priorities and offering solutions to ongoing challenges the profession faces. Special thanks to Co-Chairs Congressman Dave Joyce and Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, and Vice Chairs Congresswoman Lauren Underwood and Congresswoman Jen Kiggans, for their leadership and support.” 

“On behalf of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and the over 385,000 nurse practitioners nationwide, I offer my appreciation to Representatives Dave Joyce, Suzanne Bonamici, Lauren Underwood, and Jen Kiggans for continuing the Congressional Nursing Caucus in the House of Representatives for the 119  th  Congress,”  said AANP President Stephen A. Ferrara, DNP.  “Nurse practitioners are the provider of choice for millions of patients. It is essential that Congress advances policies that expand patient choice and remove barriers to accessing care. The Congressional Nursing Caucus plays a vital role in ensuring the voice of the nursing profession is heard in critical healthcare discussions and we look forward to working closely with the caucus to advocate for policies that empower NPs and enhance healthcare for all Americans.”

10:58:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON D.C. [1/16/25] — This week House Education and Workforce Democrats elected Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) to serve as Ranking Member on the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee. Bonamici will also serve on the Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee. 

“My passion for strengthening public education inspired me to enter public service,”  said Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici.  “I'm grateful that I will continue serving as the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education. In this time of political division I am hopeful that we can find areas of bipartisan compromise, like advancing my bipartisan FACTS Act to protect students from accidental fentanyl overdoses. But I remain deeply concerned about the increasing attacks on public education, and I will continue to stand up for all students and the local schools they attend. Last Congress I led the response to House Republicans’ disingenuous work around parental involvement by introducing the Bill of Rights for Students and Families. Instead of attacking our nation’s teachers, banning books, and rewriting history, my resolution expresses support for developing inclusive, safe, and responsive public schools that provide all students with a well-rounded education and foster meaningful family engagement in education. I also led efforts to protect the rights of LGBTQI+ students and others who are too often marginalized. As Ranking Member I will strive to advance bipartisan policies when we can, but I will never abandon the many policies that will create a brighter future for students in Oregon and around the country. 

“I also remain committed to opening more doors to opportunity so more people can afford higher education and access workforce training programs that fit their needs. For years I have worked on affordability, leading efforts to streamline income-driven loan repayment, crack down on fraudulent lenders, update the Federal Work Study Program, and more. There is much more that can be done to support people pursuing workforce training programs and I am hopeful we can continue to see bipartisan success in this area. I’m ready to get to work.” 

Bonamici has been a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee since 2013. She is a Co-Chair of the Pre-K, Child Care, CTE, Apprenticeship, and STEAM Caucuses.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -  Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick issued the following statement on President Biden’s decision to commute 2,500 nonviolent federal sentences. 

“Today, President Biden delivered on America’s longstanding promise of equal justice under the law. His announcement to commute 2,500 unjustly harsh, nonviolent sentences showcases the necessity of merciful, moral leaders devoted to America’s pledge of fairness and equality. 

Historically, the criminal justice system has disproportionately harmed marginalized communities, with sentencing practices that were carefully crafted to target and place certain groups behind bars for longer periods. Since 1983, these overly harsh drug sentences have led to a 265% increase in Florida’s prison population, a large share of whom are Black. These injustices destroyed generations of communities and families - scarring thousands of people subjected to racist policies. 

President Biden’s decision showcases the importance of critically evaluating our country’s history to amend past wrongs. No American should be subjected to different standards purely because of their background. We must go beyond the federal level and ensure that people with state-level offenses are not being subjected to disproportionately harsh sentencing laws.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2500  Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20) led a group of 40 lawmakers urging President Biden and DHS Secretary Mayorkas to redesignate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the United States. 

Haiti continues to face a series of escalating crises, including political instability, widespread violence, economic collapse, and devastating natural disasters. Gang violence has surged to unprecedented levels, displacing families, disrupting daily life, and contributing to a humanitarian emergency. Access to basic needs such as food, clean water, and medical care remains severely limited, while recovery from past disasters has been painfully slow. The situation has been exacerbated by the inability of Haitian institutions to ensure safety and governance for their citizens. 

“TPS is a lifeline, especially for Haitians. Renewing these protections ensures we can shield innocent lives from harm and prevent communities from being torn apart,”  said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick.  “TPS holders also play a huge role in our economy, supporting essential sectors like healthcare and construction. It is paramount that we extend TPS to guarantee that Haitians can remain safe in a country they’ve contributed so much to.” 

TPS is a critical tool provided under U.S. immigration law to protect individuals from returning to countries experiencing extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent safe return. Redesignating TPS for Haiti would extend these protections to individuals who arrived in the U.S. after the most recent designation in June, ensuring that those fleeing perilous conditions are not forced to return to circumstances that threaten their lives and well-being. 

In addition to its humanitarian impact, redesignating TPS would enhance America’s workforce and further boost economic contributions. TPS holders are significant contributors to federal, state, and local tax revenues. TPS holders and their households contribute $2.3 billion in federal taxes and $1.3 billion in state and local taxes annually.

Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the authority to postpone filing deadlines in the event of a presidentially-declared federal disaster, but this does not extend to state-level emergencies. 

Each year, states like California declare state-level emergencies for disasters like wildfires, floods, or earthquakes. Under current law, Californians are not eligible for federal filing relief for these disasters until they’re also declared by the President of the United States. Those declarations can take days or even weeks, which was the case in 2020 after devastating wildfires, including the Bobcat Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains, ravaged the state. That means taxpayers who just suffered a disaster might face two separate tax deadlines for state and federal returns. This legislation would ensure that victims can get the instantaneous federal filing relief they need to recover from natural disasters as soon as the Governor declares a state-level emergency. 

“Over the past week, my district has been devastated by the Eaton Fire, which has taken lives, destroyed 7,000 structures, left 20,000 people homeless, and burned countless businesses and community institutions to the ground. Thankfully, the Biden-Harris Administration issued a federal major disaster declaration for the fires across Los Angeles County, which enabled the IRS to quickly extend federal filing deadlines for victims and provide needed relief,”  said Rep. Chu.  “But for many disasters, federal declarations may come days or even weeks after the state declaration, leaving open the question of whether the IRS will be able to give disaster victims timely filing relief. The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act is a common-sense, bipartisan solution to this problem that will give the IRS the authority to bypass bureaucratic delays and immediately extend tax filing deadlines after state-declared disasters and states of emergency.” 

“Families and businesses across the nation are the victims of national disasters. Many in Tennessee are still grappling with the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene,”  said Congressman Kustoff.  “It is essential that the federal government provides the support and resources that these individuals need. That is why I introduced the Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act, which would postpone tax filing deadlines to taxpayers affected by state-declared disasters. This legislation will give families the flexibility they need to rebuild and recover.” 

The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act would allow the governor of a state or territory to extend a federal tax filing deadline in the event of a state-declared emergency or disaster, which happens automatically for federally-declared disasters. Extending this authority to states gives them the ability to provide relief independent of the federal government’s involvement in an emergency or natural disaster. The legislation would also expand the mandatory federal filing extension from 60 days to 120 days. 

“Disasters impact millions of Americans each year – from hurricanes and floods to tornadoes and wildfires. It is vital that taxpayers impacted by natural disasters and facing filing and payment deadlines are given the tools to help minimize the challenges they face as they rebuild their lives and businesses,”  said American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Vice President of Tax Policy and Advocacy, Melanie Lauridsen.  “We are grateful to Congressman Kustoff and Congresswoman Chu for their steadfast leadership on legislation that would provide this critical relief to millions of taxpayers during difficult circumstances.”

10:58:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: To protect Americans from life-threatening heat conditions in the workplace, Rep. Chu joined with Ranking Member Scott and Reps. Grijalva, Adams, and Casar to author comment letter 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — This week, Reps. Judy Chu (CA-28), Education and Workforce Committee Ranking Member Bobby Scott (VA-03), and Reps. Raúl Grijalva (AZ-07), Alma Adams (NC-12), and Greg Casar (TX-35) led 52 House Members in submitting a  comment letter  in support of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) proposed rule to protect workers from occupational exposure to extreme heat. 

“As Members of Congress, we have been calling on OSHA for years to implement a national standard to protect indoor and outdoor workers from extreme heat and are extremely pleased with your leadership in moving forward with this proposed rule,”  wrote the Members to Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su and Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. 

The Biden-Harris Administration published this Notice of a Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), titled  “Heat Injury and Illness Prevention in Outdoor and Indoor Work Settings,"  (link is external)  in August 2024. This follows years of advocacy by these Members urging adoption of a federal heat standard for workers, including a  letter  Reps. Chu, Scott, Grijalva, Adams led to the Department of Labor (DOL) in August 2021 urging the Department to undertake such a rulemaking. 

At one point during the summer of 2024, close to one third of the entire U.S. population lived in areas with dangerous levels of heat. And researchers estimate that 2024 was almost certainly the world’s hottest year on record. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 436 U.S. workers died from occupational heat stress between 2011 and 2021, an average of 40 per year. However, this is likely a significant undercount. By examining BLS data and other related research, Public Citizen estimates that occupational heat stress actually causes as many as 2,000 worker deaths and 170,000 worker illnesses and injuries annually in the U.S. 

“These facts speak for themselves:”  the Members continued,  “workers are in grave danger from extreme heat, and as global temperatures continue to rise and summer heat waves become more severe, their lives are increasingly at risk. We are moved to act not just by the data, but by the many heartbreaking stories we have heard from our constituents and workers across the nation.” 

This includes workers like Asunción Valdivia, a 53-year-old farmworker from California who tragically died of heat stroke in 2004 after picking grapes for 10 hours straight in 105-degree temperatures, and Esteban Chavez Jr., who was 24 years old when he died of heat stroke in 2022 after a day of making deliveries in Pasadena, California in an un-air-conditioned UPS truck while temperatures were in the upper 90s. 

“These tragedies were preventable. The government and places of business must act with urgency to ensure not one more person dies in the workplace from heat stress,”  wrote the Members. 

The Members therefore thanked the Biden-Harris Administration for proposing the rulemaking and urged that the final rule be as protective of workers as possible and consistent with the standards outlined in the  Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness, Injury, and Fatality Prevention Act of 2023  (link is external)  (H.R. 4897), a bipartisan bill cosponsored by 131 House Members that would have directed OSHA to establish a standard to protect workers from heat-related injuries and illnesses—providing statutory permanency and setting the minimum requirements for these protections. 

This comprehensive standard must require employers to provide workers the following: 

  1. adequate hydration; 
  2. rest breaks; 
  3. areas for rest breaks that are shaded (in the case of outdoor work) or air-conditioned (in the case of indoor work); 
  4. medical services and training to address signs and symptom of heat-related illness; and 
  5. a plan for acclimatization to high-heat work conditions. 



The Members further emphasized that an effective final rule must maintain the proposed rule’s inclusion of  “clear, specific, evidence-based temperature thresholds for what constitutes hazardous heat—called “heat triggers”—for the purpose of triggering certain employer requirements to protect workers under the standard.”  They stated that specific heat triggers will  “provide employers with needed clarity and simplicity in determining when their workers are at risk from heat and what is required of them to mitigate that risk.” 

“We urge OSHA to finalize a strong, enforceable rule…as soon as possible, to ensure robust and life-saving heat protections are finally put in place for tens of millions of vulnerable workers in every ZIP code. No one should be forced to risk their health and their life just to provide for their family,”  the Members concluded.

January 13, 2025 

Dear President-Elect Donald J. Trump, 

On Tuesday, January 7  th  , a series of fires driven by hurricane-force winds ignited across the Los Angeles region. The Eaton, Palisades, Hurst, Creek, Lidia, and Kenneth Fires have already burned over 35,000 acres, destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, displaced tens of thousands of Southern California residents, and taken at least 24 lives. Across Los Angeles County, experts estimate upwards of $150 billion in potential economic costs from this past week’s wildfires. 

The Palisades Fire has burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed more than 5,000 structures while 13,000 buildings remain under threat and communities remain under evacuation notices, including many extremely vulnerable populations. The Eaton Fire has burned more than 14,000 acres, destroyed over 7,000 structures, left 20,000 homeless, forced numerous health centers to close, and burned several schools to the ground. The Kenneth, Lidia, and Hurst Fires, while mostly or completely contained now, burned over 2,000 acres. 

Given the scale of destruction across communities we represent, we invite you to tour the damage and devastation caused by these numerous fires. We ask you to join us in meeting with those who have suffered unimaginable losses, seeing the devastation firsthand, and hearing from heroic first responders about their diligent, unrelenting service in fighting these unprecedented wildfires. Your partnership is absolutely essential to demonstrating unified, strong support for those who have lost loved ones or returned to their home or business to find nothing left. The victims of the Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, and other fires across Southern California are relying on Congress to pass bipartisan emergency disaster appropriations legislation to support the long recovery ahead. We stand ready to work with you to ensure that Congress can, as it has in the past, provide robust funding on a bipartisan basis for disaster relief and disaster victims impacted this crisis. 

We are deeply appreciative of Governor Newsom’s rapid State of Emergency declaration in response to the wildfires and the Biden-Harris Administration’s swift approval of several Fire Management Assistance Grants to reimburse California for immediate firefighting costs, as well as their immediate approval of California’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration. This declaration has strengthened coordination on response and relief efforts and ensures access to all categories of public assistance, individual assistance, and direct federal assistance for affected communities, but additional response and recovery assistance is urgently needed as we navigate a path toward recovery. That is why Congress must work together with the incoming Administration to provide continued disaster relief that will help Southern California rebuild. 

It is our sincere hope that you will accept this invitation to tour the damage in our districts caused by these fires, and we look forward to working with you to secure critical disaster relief funding that is necessary for this vibrant, beautiful, unique region to recover and rebuild.

10:58:30 root         DEBUG    Titles: Reps. Cleaver, Graves, Alford Reintroduce Pony Up Act to Hold USPS Accountable for Late Bills
10:58:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:58:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, D.C.)  – U.S. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver, II (D-MO), Sam Graves (R-MO), and Mark Alford (R-MO) re-introduced the  Pony Up Act  this week, which would protect consumers by putting the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on the hook for late delivery of bills. The legislation was originally introduced in the 118th Congress. Countless complaints have been registered by constituents whose mail hasn’t arrived on time, or at all in some cases. Many of those complaints have involved paying a late fee due to bills being delivered late. Multiple municipal utilities have also complained that their bills aren’t arriving to their customers in a timely manner. The legislation would require USPS to pay any late fees incurred on bills due to delayed delivery service. 

“With extreme weather like we saw earlier this month, not to mention the complete failure of the Postmaster General’s Delivering for America Plan, families and small businesses across my congressional district continue to voice their frustration with delivery service from the USPS. Not only is it preventing them from getting timely information, but it is costing them their hard-earned dollars as they face late fees due to delayed delivery on monthly bills,”  said Congressman Cleaver  . “We need bipartisan action to ensure these costs are not levied on hardworking Americans who have no ability to prevent these delays, and I’m proud to introduce the Pony Up Act with Reps. Graves and Alford to provide relief.” 

“Constituents across my district are routinely frustrated by late mail delivery and they should be—the Postal Service isn’t getting the job done,”  said Congressman Graves  . “Folks expect their mail to show up on time, six days a week. Instead, they are constantly faced with late deliveries and it’s costing people money. If the Postal Service isn’t going to get the mail out of the processing center and to the mailbox on time, then they should pony up and pay the late fee.” 

“The Postal Service is vital, especially for the many rural communities in Missouri’s Fourth District. The USPS has failed to fulfill their Congressionally mandated six-day delivery window. These delays carry tangible consequences; many Americans have shared accounts with delayed checks resulting in late fees on bill payments. It is only fair that the Postal Service should reimburse taxpayers for late fees accrued due to USPS delays,”  said Congressman Alford  . 

The bill would enable anyone who incurred a late fee due to the late delivery of a bill to file a claim for a late fee repayment. Filing for the repayment would occur online through a portal or in person at any post office. The legislation would also require a report on delayed mail, giving Congress relevant and accurate information to identify how effective the Postal Service is and what average delays look like. 

Over the last several years, Congressman Cleaver and Graves have voiced numerous concerns with the USPS about performance issues. In October 2022, Reps. Cleaver and Graves sent  a letter  to Postmaster General Dejoy expressing concerns about the agency’s failure to fulfill their congressionally mandated duty to provide six-day mail delivery. In December 2022, the Postal Service  responded  (link is external)  with complaints about low unemployment rates in the Kansas City region and encouraged residents to apply to work on the USPS, without offering a plan for the agency to meet their mandate. 

In March 2023, Reps. Cleaver and Graves  called on  Postmaster General DeJoy to deliver a plan to address mail delivery delays, fulfill the USPS’s legal obligation to deliver mail 6 days per week, and listen to the concerns of Kansas City residents that had been frustrated with the performance of their local USPS branches. Following that letter, the USPS OIG announced they would conduct an audit of delayed mail and delivery operations in the Northland and the Kansas City area. The  audit  (link is external)  was completed in August of last year. 

In January 2024, Cleaver and Graves  led a  cohort of fellow lawmakers calling on USPS to halt price increases on stamps, following the agency’s record-breaking fourth rate increase in the last eighteen months. The legislators demanded USPS address the failings of the Delivering for America Plan and turn around performance issues of the USPS in order to legitimize a price hike for consumers. 

In April 2024, Rep. Cleaver  joined  bipartisan calls opposing USPS consolidation and operational changes across the country. The bipartisan group of 20 Members of Congress denounced the U.S. Postal Service’s nationwide consolidation and review announcements that could severely diminish mail service reliability for postal networks nationwide. 

In September 2024, Cleaver, Graves, Alford, and other legislators  called  on the USPS to implement the audit recommendations from the OIG’S report on the Kansas City P & DC.

10:58:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, D.C.)  – Today, U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II (D-MO) announced the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded $15,514,225 in federal grant funding to support the rehabilitation of Parade Park Homes in Kansas City. The funding for capital grants and rental assistance, which Congressman Cleaver strongly advocated for, was awarded through HUD’s Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program, which supports the development, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing for low-income elderly persons. 

“I am so happy that my staff and I were successful in convincing HUD that Parade Park is a viable and valuable place to invest in the future of Kansas City’s Jazz District,”  said Congressman Cleaver  . “With this funding, our community has taken another major step in expanding access to affordable housing while maintaining local control of this historic property, which is the foundation to vibrant and prosperous communities.” 

Parade Park Homes existed as the oldest Black-owned housing cooperative in the nation, with more than 500 affordable housing units in the heart of the 18  th  and Vine Jazz District.  Since 2022  , Congressman Cleaver  has  (link is external)  worked  (link is external)  with HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge, Acting Secretary Adrian Todman, HUD officials, and local officials to stabilize the property and chart a path to preserve affordable housing, ensuring the property was  sold  (link is external)  by HUD to the City of Kansas City for redevelopment last year. Following the City’s conveyance of the property to Twelfth Street Heritage Corporation, a non-profit, Rep. Cleaver has strongly advocated for additional federal investments, including Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program funding, to support the redevelopment of Parade Park while ensuring it remains affordable to local and longtime residents. 

“From HUD to the local officials in Kansas City, this has truly been a team effort to ensure the residents of Parade Park can remain in their homes and the community can receive the redevelopment necessary to create more affordable housing for families on the east side of Kansas City,”  said Congressman Cleaver  . “The work is not finished, but this is a major victory for the people of Kansas City, and I’m thrilled to have helped play a role in making it possible.”

10:58:32 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:58:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: (Washington, D.C.)  – This week, U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II (D-MO) joined Reps. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) and Chip Roy (R-TX), along with 43 other lawmakers, in reintroducing the bipartisan  Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act  , which would effectively ban Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. To reduce opportunities for insider trading among Members of Congress, the  TRUST in Congress Act  would require lawmakers and their immediate family to either divest from individual stock holdings or move their investments into a qualified blind trust during their entire tenure in Congress, ensuring they cannot profit off the nonpublic information provided to lawmakers. 

“Just as we prevent athletes from betting on games in which they can have a direct impact on the outcome or inside information about the team’s performance, it is common sense to ban lawmakers from investing in stocks,”  said Congressman Cleaver  . “At a time when the American people’s faith in our democratic institutions is at an all-time low, lawmakers must take steps to demonstrate they are committed to serving the public, not their personal stock portfolios. That’s why I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act.” 

The  TRUST in Congress Act  was originally introduced in 2020. The legislation will: 

  * Require all current Members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children to divest from certain investment assets or place them into a qualified blind trust within 180 days after the enactment of this legislation. New Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, would be required to place covered investments into a qualified blind trust within 90 days of assuming office. Affected individuals can remove assets from the blind trust 180 days after the Member leaves Congress.

##  Sending STEM ambassadors to local high schools 

MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced a $1,999,581 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to the University of Memphis for a project titled “S-STEM Bridging the Gaps: Cultivating STEM Identity and Success through STEM Outreach, Networking, and Scholarships,” under the direction of Dr. Stephanie Ivey, Associate Dean for Research and Professor of Civil Engineering. 

According to the NSF, the overall goal of this project is to increase Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project will contribute significantly to understanding why STEM identities are important for engineering students and how students develop STEM identities and what evidence-based practices best support engineering student self-efficacy, career attitudes, retention, and graduation. A distinguishing feature of the program is the multi-tiered approach to faculty mentoring scholars, scholars networking with peers, and scholars (as STEM Ambassadors) mentoring high school students. Over the four-year period, thousands of K-12 students and their teachers will be affected through the STEM Ambassador program. The STEM Ambassadors will positively impact K-12 students with whom they share similar backgrounds. At the conclusion of the scholarship award period, scholars are expected to attain bachelor's degrees in an engineering discipline and proceed thereafter to the workforce or to a graduate program. 

Congressman Cohen made the following statement: 

“I commend the University and Dr. Ivey on receiving this prestigious National Science Foundation grant award. The project it underwrites will transform the lives of talented college students and the K-12 students that the ambassadors will reach. It’s clear we need more scientists, engineers and technical people in our workforce. This effort will supercharge those efforts by reaching talented students in financial need.”

##  Effort to enforce the Constitution’s Emoluments clauses violated during his first term 

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, today introduced the Constitutional Emoluments Protection of American Interests Act, a measure to prohibit federal funds being used at any property owned, managed by, or under the control of former and future President Donald J. Trump. 

As early as November 2017, Congressman Cohen cited violations of the emoluments clauses in his articles of impeachment against Trump. In April 2019, Congressman Cohen led a letter with 40 House members asking Appropriations Committee members to include language prohibiting the use of federal funds at businesses owned by Trump. Legislatively, starting in 2017, and continuing through Trump’s first term in office, Congressman Cohen offered amendments to appropriations bills blocking federal funds from going to Trump Organization properties. 

In October of last year, Congressman Cohen endorsed the conclusion of the House Oversight Committee that Trump violated the emoluments clauses by receiving “ethically suspect payments” through his lease of the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump no longer leases the facility. 

Congressman Cohen made the following statement: 

“Our recently minted felon-in-chief was already a grifter during his first term and clearly violated the Constitution’s emoluments clauses. Some mechanism needs to be in place to prohibit his continued scoffing at Constitutional provisions designed to prevent corruption and self-dealing. This measure should place in check the future president’s misuse of his office for private gain at least in the realm of federal funding at his properties. It’s unfortunate that such a measure is necessary, but we’ve had our eyes opened by this self-serving man.”

##  Providing bankruptcy relief for those in financial distress 

WASHINGTON – Congressmen Steve Cohen (TN-9), Danny K. Davis (IL-7) and Eric Swalwell (CA-14) today reintroduced the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act, a measure to provide critical relief to those in severe financial distress because of overwhelming student loan debt. 

Before 2005, private student loans issued by for-profit lenders were treated in bankruptcy like most other unsecured consumer debt, such as credit card debt. The Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act will ensure that privately issued student loans will once again be treated like other consumer debt and be dischargeable in bankruptcy. 

Congressman Cohen made the following statement: 

“When Congress changed the bankruptcy law, it did so without considering the harm that would be done by those who could not afford their private student loans but prohibited them from resorting to the unappealing but available remedy of bankruptcy. We have waited far too long for this commonsense solution to be enacted, and for fairness to return to the treatment of all consumer debt.” 

Congressman Davis made the following statement: 

“I am proud to join with Rep. Cohen to lead this bill to protect struggling Americans by restoring the treatment of private student loans like any other consumer debt. The hallmark of bankruptcy law is to give one a chance of meaningful relief. Shockingly, a 2005 law removed this protection, benefiting for-profit lenders and preventing struggling borrowers from assistance. This bill stops the unfair punishment of hard-working Americans and restores the fair treatment of private student loan borrowers.” 

Congressman Swalwell made the following statement: 

“As someone with student loan debt, I know more must be done to relieve Americans of this financial burden. That’s why I’m proud to reintroduce the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act. Too often young people are forced to defer their dreams of starting a family, becoming a homeowner, or launching a new business. This bill will protect student borrowers, restore fairness in student lending, and incentivize more students to pursue a college education.” 

Private student loans have much in common with credit cards and subprime mortgages. For example, private student loans often have onerous interest rates with no caps and can include exorbitant fees and hidden charges. In addition, many lenders have used aggressive marketing and high-pressure sales tactics to target particularly vulnerable people including young men and women without financial experience, and older Americans seeking to re-start their careers by pursuing higher education and training. 

To make matters worse, private student loans lack the critical consumer protections that come with federal student loans. For instance, private lenders are not required to – and typically do not – provide any of the deferments, income-based repayment plans, cancellation rights, or loan forgiveness programs that are available to federal student loan borrowers. 

When Congress changed the bankruptcy law, it did so without any substantive analysis so that student loans made by private, for-profit lenders became very difficult to discharge in bankruptcy. Currently, Section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of private educational debt unless the debtor, in addition to meeting the already stringent requirements for personal bankruptcy, proves that repayment would impose an “undue hardship” on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents. In practice, it’s hard for a debtor to ever successfully meet this standard. 

Original cosponsors of the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act include Representatives Julia Brownley (CA-26) and Gwen Moore (WI-4).

##  Restores disclosure requirement repealed in 1995 

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today applauded House passage of his bill, the TVA Salary Transparency Act, that he introduced with Representative Tim Burchett (TN-2). This bill aims to reinstate and modernize the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) annual reporting requirements to Congress concerning its management structure and the compensation of its top executives and managers. The bill reinstates a requirement eliminated by the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act in 1995 and requires TVA to report on employees making more than $123,041, or the maximum basic pay rate of a General Schedule Grade 15 (GS-15) federal employees. This bill previously passed the House in the 118th Congress on March 11, 2024. 

After a brief floor debate managed by Congressman Cohen on Monday, the House voted 423 to 0 today to pass the measure. 

Following the vote, Congressman Cohen made the following statement: 

“I was pleased to team up with Congressman Tim Burchett in reintroducing this measure on the first day of the new Congress and especially pleased to see the House act swiftly to assure transparency in the oversight of our largest federal power producer. I urge the Senate to act quickly on this measure so that we can finally restore legitimate congressional oversight.”

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that Shelby County’s Ryan White HIV Emergency Relief Program will receive a $1,288,750 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

Congressman Cohen made the following statement 

“I am pleased to see this substantial federal investment in the health of some of the most vulnerable our community. This funding for Shelby County’s Ryan White program is critical because the Memphis region has one of the highest HIV rates in the country.” 

The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides a comprehensive system of care that includes primary medical care and essential support services for people living with HIV who are uninsured or underinsured. The Program works with cities, states, and local community-based organizations to provide HIV care and treatment services to more than half a million people each year. 

The grant program is named for Ryan White, an Indiana teenager and hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from infected blood. He died in 1990.

##  Effort to improve relations by reversing Trump action 

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), who has long admired the Cuban people and has advocated for improved relations with the island nation, today applauded President Biden’s decision to lift its “state sponsor of terrorism” designation applied by Donald Trump in early 2021. 

Congressman Cohen made the following statement: 

“I applaud President Biden’s decision to lift the ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ designation from Cuba and hope it leads to improved relations between our countries. The Castros are gone, and it’s well past time to allow the Cuban economy to recover and also to allow American companies to do business in Cuba and for travel to resume for American citizens. Trump’s punitive decision in 2021 didn’t make sense, and I hope it will not be reinstated. I agree with the Biden administration that there is ‘no credible evidence’ Cuba is currently supporting international terrorism. It’s time to reestablish the healthy relationship begun during the Obama administration.”

10:58:47 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
10:58:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Congressman Mike Collins (GA-10) has been appointed as Chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee by Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves (MO-06). 

The Subcommittee has direct oversight of issues that pertain to water resources, conservation and management, water infrastructure, and hazardous waste cleanup, as well as the United States Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, and the EPA. 

“It is an honor to serve as Chairman of the crucial Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee. I look forward to increasing our global trade competitiveness and hitting the ground running to cut the bureaucratic red tape that is hurting our nation,”  said Rep. Collins.  “Our efforts will build up America’s ports, including the Port of Savannah, to their highest potential and reign in the Army Corps of Engineers. We need to bring back America First policies and start reforming the broken regulatory environment that has held our country back for too long, and right now is our best opportunity to make generational changes.” 

“Mike Collins has rolled up his sleeves and become a leader on the Committee, and I’m excited to name him as the Chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,”  said House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves.  “I look forward to working with Mike in his new capacity as Subcommittee Chairman as he leads our efforts to improve our nation’s water infrastructure – from ports and waterways to flood protection and wastewater infrastructure – and to ensuring a reasonable and balanced approach to protecting water quality that doesn’t stifle economic growth or the need to build America’s infrastructure.” 

“The Georgia Ports Authority congratulates Congressman Collins on this important new role. Georgia’s seaports are critical economic drivers for the United States, and we look forward to working closely with Chairman Collins throughout his tenure,”  said Georgia Ports Authority CEO & President Griff Lynch. 

The highest priority of Chairman Collins and the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee is the biennial Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which gives the Army Corps of Engineers authority to plan and execute flood control, navigation, and other improvement projects under the Corps’ Civil Works division. 

Rep. Collins’ appointment as Chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee shows Collins’ continued commitment to growing Georgia’s economy. In WRDA 2024, Rep. Collins was able to  secure key provisions  that: 

  * Protected the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam from the government’s plan to reduce Augusta’s water storage and limit recreational activities on the Savannah River. 
  * Directed the deepening of the Port of Savannah, a project to maintain the port’s global competitiveness and ensure that Georgia remains a top-tier global trading hub. 
  * Lowered hydropower rates, which will reduce energy costs for Georgians who rely on hydropower. 



This appointment also gives Georgia’s farmers a seat at the table as the committee investigates the regulatory burden caused by the EPA’s “Waters of the United States” rule and other legacy regulations that have held back Georgia’s agribusinesses. 

Rep. Collins is one of six Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members with a subcommittee gavel and has served on the committee since joining Congress in 2023. He also sits on the House Natural Resource Committee and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.

10:58:50 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:58:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Congressman Jim Costa (CA-21) led Valley Leaders in introducing two bipartisan bills to build on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s impact by increasing funding and expanding support for groundwater recharge projects in the San Joaquin Valley.    
  
“Groundwater recharge is one of the most effective ways to build resilience against drought,”  said Congressman Costa.  “These bipartisan bills build on the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by leveraging federal resources for groundwater recharge projects that provide long-term solutions to safeguard the San Joaquin Valley from the impacts of extreme drought.”    
  
“The San Joaquin Valley produces crops that feed families across our nation, but for too long has struggled to maintain sufficient access to water for farmers,”  said Congressman Gray.  “It’s time to cut the red tape holding our agricultural communities back from expanding their capacity. I’m proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues as an original cosponsor of the Every Drop Counts Act and the Groundwater Recharge Technical Assistance Act to protect and strengthen water access for farmers in my San Joaquin Valley district and across the country.”    
  
“As a dairy farmer and lifelong resident of the Central Valley, I know firsthand the devastating impacts of water shortages on our agricultural industry, communities, and economy,”  said Congressman Valadao.  “Water is the lifeblood of our region, and these pieces of legislation take essential steps to maximize water storage, recharge groundwater, and ensure California has access to this vital resource. With these improvements, we can better address the challenges of drought, stabilize our water tables, and secure our water future.”    
  
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?    
"As we face the ongoing challenges of water scarcity in the West, the introduction of the Every Drop Counts Act, and the Groundwater Technical Assistance Act represents a useful step toward ensuring a sustainable future for our communities, ecosystems, and farms. These bipartisan efforts will not only enhance our capabilities for groundwater recharge but also empower local agencies to innovate and implement solutions that restore our vital aquifers. Together, we are laying the groundwork for a resilient water supply that supports agriculture, the environment, and the needs of our growing population."  said Jason Phillips, CEO of Friant Water Authority.    
  
"Diminished water supplies have severely impacted agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley. Farmers can’t produce the food needed to feed our nation without adequate water. Not only that, water shortages hurt rural communities, including disadvantaged areas, wildlife refuges, and the region's economy. We must support infrastructure investments, including financial and technical assistance, to enhance the Valley's capacity to store more water in our depleted groundwater basins.”  said Austin Ewell, Executive Director, Water Blueprint for the San Joaquin Valley.    
  
“The Every Drop Counts Act and the Groundwater Technical Assistance Act, both bipartisan legislative efforts, have the potential to be foundationally complementary to our Central Valley’s and California’s path towards water sustainability and resilience. Many of our Valley communities depend and appreciate the championing of these legislative efforts; I’m genuinely excited and hopeful about this effort,”  said Eddie Campo, Self-Help Enterprises.    
  
BACKGROUND    
Since 2019, California has added 8.7 million acre-feet to its groundwater storage, including 4.1 million acre-feet of managed recharge in 2023 alone. This increase is equivalent to the annual water usage of 26.1 million households. This progress was fueled by the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  (link is external)  , which invested  over $65 million in groundwater projects  throughout the San Joaquin Valley.    
  
The  Every Drop Counts Act  (link is external)  would expand the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Small Storage Program by making it easier for groundwater projects to qualify for funding, increase the amount of water they can store, and stabilize underground aquifers. This would benefit projects like the Kern Fan Groundwater Recharge Project and the Upper Kings River Water Resiliency Program, helping the San Joaquin Valley better prepare for drought and have a more reliable and flexible water supply.  This legislation is cosponsored by David Valadao (CA-22), Adam Gray (CA-13), Josh Harder (CA-09), and Russ Fulcher (ID-01).    
  
The  Groundwater Recharge Technical Assistance Act  (link is external)  provides $3 million annually to support groundwater recharge projects. This would empower the Secretary of the Interior (DOI) to use unobligated funds under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Western Water funding for aquifer storage, clean drinking water, and flood protection efforts. This legislation aims to strengthen drought resilience and help the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation address extreme weather challenges in California and the West.  This legislation is cosponsored by David Valadao (CA-22), Adam Gray (CA-13), Josh Harder (CA-09), Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), and Mike Thompson (CA-04).

WASHINGTON –  Congressman Jim Costa (CA-21) co-introduced the  National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support, and Community Outreach Act  . 

“This bipartisan bill is about standing with the brave men and women of law enforcement and their families,”  said Congressman Costa  . “It ensures they have the support, resources, and recognition they deserve—because their sacrifices and dedication to protecting our communities should never be overlooked.” 

###  BACKGROUND 

The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), created by Congress in 1984, operates the National Law Enforcement Museum and Memorial. Its mission is to honor fallen officers, share the history and contributions of law enforcement, and improve safety for those in the field. 

The  National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support, and Community Outreach Act  proposes creating a formal program within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) to provide grants to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF). Read the bill text  HERE  (link is external)  . 

These grants would support vital initiatives through the National Law Enforcement Museum, including: 

  * Honoring and memorializing law enforcement officers. 

  * Collecting and analyzing data on officer fatalities and injuries. 

  * Promoting public education about law enforcement's role and challenges. 

  * Improving officer safety and wellness programs. 

  * Strengthening ties between law enforcement and the communities they serve. 




This legislation was introduced by Representatives Jimmy Panetta (CA-XX), and Troy Nehls (TX-XX), along with 29 co-sponsors. 

The  National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support and Community Outreach Act  is supported by NLEMOF’s board member organizations, including the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Fraternal Order of Police, Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, International Union of Police Associations/AFL-CIO, Motorola Solutions, Verizon, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Associations, COPS, DuPont, National Black Police Association, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, National Policing Institute, National Troopers Coalition, Police Executive Research Forum, Police Unity Tour, and the United Federation of Police Officers.

Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Jared Golden (D-ME), and Val Hoyle (D-OR) released the following statement regarding USTR’s Section 301 investigation into China’s trade practices in the commercial shipbuilding sector: 

“The results of the Biden Administration’s shipbuilding investigation confirm that, for too long, China has been using tactics like state-sponsored subsidies and anti-competitive practices to cheat and undercut American shipbuilding. It’s time for bold action to address China’s unfair practices and rebuild our shipbuilding industry—not only to create good-paying jobs but also to bolster our national security and supply chains. We urge the incoming Administration to heed the results of this investigation and to implement the strongest possible measures to level the playing field for American shipbuilding workers.”    
  
In April, Rep. Courtney led  a letter with 37 other Members of Congress  (link is external)  in support of a petition filed by a coalition of five labor unions urging USTR to initiate a Section 301 investigation into the acts, policies, and practices of China relating to competition in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. USTR subsequently announced that it would accept the petition, and in May, Caucus Co-Chairs Reps. Dingell and Norcross and Caucus Member Rep. Courtney  testified in support  (link is external)  of American workers and the domestic shipbuilding industry as part of USTR’s investigation.    
  
In October, the Caucus Co-Chairs and Caucus members Reps.

“Today’s Gaza ceasefire, whose structure was designed last May by the U.S. and endorsed by the United Nations, will finally bring relief to Israeli hostages and thousands of innocent non-combatant Palestinians who need immediate help. The tireless shuttle diplomacy of Secretary Blinken and his teammates, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, will be long remembered for saving lives and fostering a new direction towards stability in the Middle East.”

The USS GROTON, a future ballistic missile submarine, is scheduled for delivery in 2032. 

“Today’s decision by the US Navy to honor Groton, Connecticut as the name of its next submarine is welcome news. Groton is the birthplace of the modern nuclear-powered Navy under Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and home to our nation’s oldest submarine base, as well as the Electric Boat shipyard whose talented shipbuilders have played a leading role since World War II where they constructed 74 submarines to fight the Axis powers. The naming of the third Columbia class submarine as the future USS GROTON is a well-deserved badge of honor that rightly acknowledges our community’s historic role in the United States submarine force,”  said Courtney.

10:59:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC –  Today, U.S. Representative Angie Craig announced that she has secured critical clean energy grants to lower energy costs and create jobs across Minnesota’s Second District as part of an $825 million federal investment  delivered to Minnesota utilities this month. 

Through the Empowering Rural America Program, Dakota Electric Association will receive $500,000 to deploy a new distribution management system that will improve efficiency and service across four Minnesota counties, including Dakota, Rice and Scott Counties. Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative will receive $900,000 to implement a new software system that will provide increased flexibility to customers across the state, including in Dakota, Le Sueur, Rice and Scott Counties. 

Great River Energy will receive a historic $794 million investment to procure 1,275 megawatts of renewable energy in rural areas across Minnesota, including in the Second Congressional District. This grant is expected to create over 1,600 jobs, cut costs for members by approximately $40 million per year and reduce climate pollution by over 5.49 million tons annually. 

“Minnesota’s rural utilities and electric co-ops keep the lights on for folks across the Second District and it's critical they have the resources they need to expand their operations and put more affordable clean energy into families’ homes,”  said Rep. Craig.  “I’m proud to have secured this funding to expand service in our rural communities, cut energy costs and create good-paying Minnesota jobs – all while advancing the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead.” 

Rep. Craig secured this funding as part of the  Inflation Reduction Act  .

E&K Convenience Inc. based in Prior Lake, will receive $520,000 to install E15 and B20 biofuel dispensers, an ethanol storage tank and a biodiesel storage tank at two stations. Hennen’s Auto Service will receive $604,500 to install E15, E85 and B20 dispensers, ethanol storage tanks and a biodiesel storage tank at their station in Shakopee. 

This grant was awarded through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentives Program, which is part of a $239 million investment made in the  Inflation Reduction Act  to increase the availability of domestic biofuels in 18 states and give Americans cleaner, more affordable fuel options. 

“Increasing the production and availability of biofuels is a critical step in implementing the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead, and Minnesota is leading the way,”  said Rep. Craig.  “I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues to pass legislation to lower fuel costs for more Minnesotans.” 

Last Congress Rep. Craig introduced  bipartisan legislation  to make year-round access to E15 permanent nationwide – expanding market access for Minnesota farmers and lowering costs for drivers at the gas pump. 

The  Inflation Reduction Act  , which passed in 2022 with Rep. Craig’s support, made the largest investment ever in homegrown biofuels infrastructure.

10:59:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  Rep. Crockett led 20 lawmakers in a letter calling for President Biden to commute those individuals serving longer sentences due to the crack cocaine versus powder cocaine sentencing disparity that was established during the 1980’s “War on Drugs” 

WASHINGTON, DC  \- Today, Congresswomen Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) applauded President Biden for answering her call to commute the sentences of 2,500 non-violent drug offenders, including individuals serving longer sentences for crack cocaine offenses as a result of the sentencing disparities established during the 1980s and 1990s "War On Drugs." This comes after Rep. Crockett led a letter with 20 of her congressional colleagues calling on President Biden to right this historical wrong and commute the sentences of those still serving time on convictions that would receive far shorter sentences today.    
  
"With today’s action, President Joe Biden has now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in history. In doing so, President Biden has wielded his executive power to identify and correct the impacts of our country’s failed criminal justice policies of the past and build upon his legacy of ensuring equitable and restorative justice. 

"Over the last several months, I have worked and spoken with civil rights organizations and the Biden Administration to address the vestiges of failed drug policies of the 1980s that have disproportionately impacted communities of color—particularly the Black community. One of these policies is the criminal sentencing disparity between crack cocaine offences and powder cocaine offenses. To be clear, scientific research has disproven the inaccurate assumptions that were used to justify making crack cocaine offenses subject to harsher criminal sentences than powder cocaine. In fact, the U.S. Sentencing Commission and scientific research have reported there is no difference between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, as both produce the same physiological and psychotropic effects. But, because this disparity has continued, our country has had significant portions of our communities of color locked away for unconscionable lengths of time simply because the individual had a different form of cocaine than someone else. 

"Recognizing the unique clemency power vested to President Biden, I led a campaign supported by 20 of my colleagues in the House and Senate this December calling on the President to commute the sentences of individuals convicted of crack cocaine offenses to sentence lengths had they been charged with powder cocaine offenses. And today President Biden did just that. 

"As a member of Congress, it is often hard to quantify the impact of our work. But the action taken by President Biden today will have a tangible, life-changing impact for over 2,500 individuals whose sentences are now commuted, to say nothing of the impact on their family and friends. I am eternally grateful to President Biden for showing the country and the world what true servant leadership looks like. In the years ahead, I look forward to working with my colleagues in my new role as a member of the House Judiciary Committee towards creating a fairer criminal justice system built on recovery, reentry, and restoration." 

  
Congresswoman Crockett has been appointed to the position of Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, and will also serve as a member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Integrity, Security, and Enforcement.

10:59:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  \- On January 16, 2025, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) and Senator John Cornyn (TX) introduced legislation to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Dallas after the late Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. The bill would rename the facility as the “Eddie Bernice Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center”, to honor the Congresswoman's 30 years of service as U.S. Representative for Texas' 30th Congressional District and 10 years of service within the Texas Legislature. Additionally, prior to being elected to public office, Congresswoman Johnson dedicated 16 years of service as the first Black American to serve as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital.    
  
"As I carry on in the footsteps of my trailblazing predecessor, I see Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson's legacy and impact in every corner of the district I represent: from Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station where the regional rail that she helped fund is connecting communities across North Texas, to the Eddie Bernice Johnson STEM Academy in Wilmer, Texas, where students are learning the skills they will need to forge a career in science and technology—sectors boosted by the CHIPS and Science Act that Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson championed,"  said Rep. Crockett.  "Throughout her 30 years of service to the people of North Texas, Congresswoman Johnson was guided by her service-driven heart and compassion for Texans in need —the same qualities that fueled her work as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital for nearly two decades. Congresswoman Johnson never forgot the servicemen and women she treated there, and fought to increase funding and resources for veteran and mental healthcare from her early days in the Texas Capitol to her last years in Congress, introducing the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act in 2019 and the Strengthening Mental Health Supports for BIPOC Communities Act in 2020."    
  
Crockett continues,  "I am grateful to my colleague, Senator John Cornyn, for working with me to honor Congresswoman Johnson's legacy by leading this bill in the U.S. Senate. I am eager to walk through the doors of the Eddie Bernice Johnson Dallas VA Medical Center alongside Senator Cornyn and the Texas veterans that she cared for so dearly."    
  
“Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson was a trailblazer and longtime advocate for veterans,”  said Sen. Cornyn.  “This legislation to rename the VA Medical Center in Dallas in Congresswoman Johnson’s honor—nearly 70 years after she was hired as a nurse at this very hospital—would ensure her legacy of service is forever preserved.” 

This bill is supported by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the Senate and Representatives Al Green (TX-9), Joaquin Castro (TX-20), Henry Cuellar (TX-28), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29), Veronica Escobar (TX-16), and Lance Gooden (TX-5).

"In less than a week, President-elect Trump will return to the White House armed with his far-right Project 2025 agenda and a Supreme Court filled with Justices he himself appointed. It is the role of the House Judiciary Committee to provide a crucial check on our courts and criminal legal system, but the past two years have taught us that the House Republican Conference has no interest in providing that check if it risks the ire of the Orange Man in the White House. It is up to the House Democratic Caucus to demand accountability of our courts and law enforcement systems and defend the civil rights and liberties of the communities that have suffered abuse at the hands of these systems: women, communities of color, religious minorities, LGBTQIA communities, disabled Americans, and immigrant communities. I am honored to be named to the role Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, and am eager to work alongside my colleagues under the brilliant leadership of Ranking Member Raskin as we fight defend our constitution and preserve the reproductive rights, voting rights, and civil liberties of all Americans we are charged to serve." 

“Rep. Jasmine Crockett will be an outstanding Ranking Member of the critical House Subcommittee on Responsiveness and Accountability to Oversight in the 119th Congress, and her appointment is a testament to her exceptional capabilities and dynamic leadership. Collaborating closely with Ranking Member Jamie Raskin and the entire Judiciary Committee, Rep. Crockett will address critical challenges and advance meaningful initiatives for the American people. I look forward to witnessing all she will achieve in this role,” said  Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse.

She will no longer be serving on the House Agriculture Committee. 

"As a public defender, civil rights and criminal defense attorney, State Representative, and now United States Congresswoman, I have dedicated the past two decades to advocating for the most vulnerable individuals in our society and leveling the playing field for justice-impacted individuals. I am honored to continue my fight for justice as a member of the House Judiciary Committee and look forward to protecting Americans' civil rights and liberties, upholding the Constitution, and improving the administration of justice throughout America’s criminal legal system. I am also thrilled to continue working alongside my good friend and mentor, Ranking Member Jamie Raskin. In continuing my role on the House Oversight Committee, I remain fired up and ready to work with both returning and new colleagues under the strong leadership of Rep. Gerry Connolly, where we will continue to shine a spotlight on government abuses and corruption.   
  
“With Donald Trump poised to use the Republican-controlled Congress and the rest of the federal government as a rubber-stamp for his Project 2025 right-wing agenda, the role of House Democrats has never been more critical. This may be a new Congress, but my fight for what’s right remains as true and strong as in the last Congress. No matter how hard my Republican colleagues work to strip back the rights and protections afforded to the people of this country, I will continue to dedicate myself to preserving and protecting our democracy. I am grateful to the Caucus for putting their faith in me to serve in these important roles. Let’s get to work.”

10:59:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  Awards come from Davids-backed bipartisan infrastructure law 

Today, Representative Sharice Davids announced a $4 million investment in upgrades to Kansas rail crossings in Gardner, Olathe, and Spring Hill. The awards, which come from the Department of Transportation’s  Rail Crossing Elimination Grant Program  (link is external)  , were made possible by the Davids-backed  bipartisan infrastructure law  . 

“The bipartisan infrastructure law is continuing to make a difference for Kansans and I’m thrilled that local governments in the Third District are taking advantage of the opportunities made possible by this historic law,” said  Davids.  “This grant means less traffic, fewer accidents, and safer roadways for the thousands of Kansans navigating these rail crossings when commuting to work, school, and home.” 

The projects announced today will include the potential closing of at-grade crossings. By eliminating these crossings, motorists and pedestrians will have a safer commute to work, school, and home. But not only will safety improve, but also commute times, as motorists will no longer need to slow down to cross or wait as trains pass, decreasing congestion. Specifically, the projects include: 

  * Gardner - Moonlight Road Grade Separation Planning Study:  $536,000 
    * The project aims to eliminate the at-grade crossing at Moonlight Road by developing and selecting a grade separation alternative to improve safety, reduce delays, and enhance mobility. 
  * Olathe - Olathe West Track Rail Crossing Study:  $1,750,000 
    * The project will study eight at-grade crossings in Olathe, Kansas, to identify safety improvements like closures or grade separations. 
  * Spring Hill - Eastern Kansas Communities Rail Corridor At-Grade Crossing Elimination Plan:  $1,720,000 
    * The project will evaluate the potential closing of 12 at-grade crossings and explore a new grade-separated crossing along the BNSF Fort Scott Subdivision in Spring Hill, Fontana, and Fort Scott, all aimed at enhancing safety at dangerous crossings. 



“The City of Gardner is grateful for the federal grant award from the Rail Crossing Elimination Grant Program, which will pay for a study that will develop grade separation alternatives and select a preferred alternative to mitigate the challenges that the Moonlight Road crossing imposes on the City of Gardner and BNSF,” said  James Pruetting, City Administrator, City of Gardner.  “ If the preferred alternative is constructed, this Project would benefit the Gardner community by improving safety; reducing travel delays for rail and vehicle traffic; and facilitating better access to jobs, schools, and emergency services. 

Davids is the only member of the Kansas delegation to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure law, which  was named  (link is external)  the most fiscally responsible infrastructure law in at least a decade by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

10:59:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Representative Sharice Davids announced her reassignment to the U.S. House Transportation & Infrastructure (T&I) and Agriculture Committees for the 119th Congress. Davids has served on the T&I Committee since being sworn into Congress and  joined  the Agriculture Committee in 2022 after Kansas’ Third District was expanded to include more rural areas. Davids' role represents a voice for the state on two major drivers of Kansas' economy. 

"I'm proud to represent our diverse and vibrant community, and through these committee assignments, I will work to build an economy that works for everyone in our district," said  Davids  . "Infrastructure and agriculture are issues that touch every person in the Kansas Third — the food we eat, the water we drink, the systems that connect us. My goal on these committees is to bring Kansans' voices, concerns, and successes to my work in Washington." 

Both committees are set to take up major legislation this session. The Agriculture Committee will continue its work on the Farm Bill, which shapes federal agriculture and nutrition policy impacting urban and rural families across Kansas. The Transportation & Infrastructure Committee is expected to address surface transportation reauthorization, a key opportunity to improve roads, bridges, and transit systems essential to Kansas communities. 

Davids has a strong bipartisan record on both committees. On T&I, she helped investigate the  Boeing 737 MAX crashes  , passed bipartisan legislation on  aviation  technology and workforce, and secured historic  infrastructure investments  . She has hosted U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and committee leaders to showcase critical infrastructure projects in the Kansas City area. 

On Agriculture, Davids brought U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretaries to the Third District to discuss the region's  meatpacking  and  dairy  industries. She led a  Farm Bill listening tour  across the district and convened over  20 stakeholders  , including former Senator Pat Roberts, to advocate for a Farm Bill benefiting all Kansans. In 2022, she was named a  Friend of the Farm Bureau  by the Kansas Farm Bureau.

10:59:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C  . – Today, U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), a member of the Select Committee on China, released the following statement after the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled Congress has the authority to force TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership. 

“It’s no secret that TikTok is malware by the Chinese Communist Party,”  said Johnson  . “The app is designed to promote Chinese propaganda, harvest sensitive data on American users, and surveil users’ activity on their phones. I’m glad the Supreme Court voted to uphold the bill that forces TikTok to cut ties from the Chinese Communist Party in order to continue operating in the U.S.” 

Johnson  co-sponsored  the  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act  , which passed the House in April 2024. Johnson has long been a critic of TikTok and ByteDance. In 2022, he introduced the  Block the Tok Act  to remove TikTok from federal government devices. Later that year, he  voted  to ban it on federal government devices. 

The  Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act  would remove Chinese Communist Party-backed ByteDance apps, including TikTok, from American app stores and web hosting services unless the application severs ties to entities like ByteDance that are subject to control of a foreign adversary.

“House Republicans are getting straight to work on conservative priorities,”  said Johnson  . “Protecting women’s sports and ensuring illegal aliens are deported for sex offenses and domestic violence offenses are no brainers. We have to ensure the safety of American children, families, and communities.” 

Johnson also voted to pass both bills when they passed the House last Congress. 

The  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  : 

  * Clarifies that a recipient of federal education funding violates Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination if the recipient operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs or activities and allows a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls. 
  * States that sex in the athletic context must be recognized based only on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth. 
  * Clarifies that the bill’s provisions do not prohibit schools or institutions from permitting males to practice against women’s sports teams, protecting the longstanding routine of some women’s athletic programs of practicing or scrimmaging against males. 



The  Preventing  Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act  : 

  * Creates a ground of inadmissibility for aliens who are convicted of, who admit having committed, or who admit committing acts that constitute the essential elements of a sex offense. 
  * Closes a loophole in immigration law by establishing a new ground of inadmissibility for several domestic violence-related offenses. 
  * Expands the existing ground of removability for domestic violence offenses, ensuring that additional offenders can be removed from the country.

“Most Americans agree that congressmen should be banned from buying stocks,”  said Johnson  . “As members of Congress, we may have access to information regarding companies and markets, and we absolutely should not have the ability to use this information for personal gain.” 

The  TRUST in Congress Act  requires a Member of Congress, their spouse, and dependent children to place stock investments into a qualified blind trust until 180 days after the end of their tenure in Congress. A covered investment under this bill is defined as investment in a security, a commodity, or a future, or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means such as the use of a derivative. 

Johnson cosponsored the  TRUST in Congress Act  in the 117th and 118th Congress.

Randy Feenstra (R-Hull) helped introduce the  Security First Act  , which would fully fund Operation Stonegarden — a grant program that supports law enforcement activity to enhance border security — and call on the U.S. Secretary of State to consider designating the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 

“It’s critical that our law enforcement officers and border patrol agents have the resources that they need to do their jobs and keep our communities safe,”  said Rep. Feenstra  . “That’s why I helped introduce legislation to fully fund Operation Stonegarden — an important program that delivers financial support to law enforcement in their mission to secure our border — and encourage the Secretary of State to designate the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. With President Trump in the White House, we will stand strong with our border patrol agents, combat the cartels, and lock down our border. The American people demand action, and Republicans will see to it that we have a secure border.”

“Due to President Biden’s open-border policies, innocent Americans have been needlessly victimized by illegal immigrants, suffering sex crimes and domestic violence. That’s why I voted for legislation to ensure that any illegal immigrant who commits a sex crime or domestic violence offense is swiftly detained and deported,”  said Rep. Feenstra  . “With unified Republican leadership in our nation’s capital, we will deliver where the Biden administration intentionally failed, lock down our border, and protect our families and communities from violent crime.”

Randy Feenstra (R-Hull) sent a letter to the President of the National Association of Independent Schools, Debra Wilson, demanding answers about the inclusion of antisemitic speakers at its conferences in Denver, Colorado and how such hateful rhetoric was allowed to be spewed. 

“Following Hamas’ violent invasion of Israel in October of 2023, antisemitism has significantly increased throughout the United States and around the world. Jewish students are being targeted and harassed on college campuses, synagogues have been vandalized, and Jewish-owned businesses have faced attacks. Even national organizations with nonprofit status are allowing antisemitism to permeate into their conferences. It’s unacceptable and those responsible must be held accountable,”  said Rep. Feenstra  . “In response to antisemitism at conferences recently held by the National Association of Independent Schools in Denver, I led a letter to the organization’s president condemning this inexcusable behavior and requesting answers about how certain speakers were allowed to spew anti-Jewish hatred and how such actions will be prevented in the future. We must always speak out against antisemitism and stand with our Jewish community here in the United States and our allies in Israel.”

Feenstra  . “As a father of two daughters, keeping women and girls safe in sports and at school is very important to me. That’s why I voted to ban men from competing in women’s sports and keep boys out of private spaces reserved for women and girls.”

Randy Feenstra (R-Hull) emphasized the importance of passing his  Death Tax Repeal Act  , which would permanently repeal the federal death tax. 

“The death tax is an egregious double tax that unfairly targets our family farms and small businesses. The death of a loved one should not trigger a massive tax bill from the federal government that threatens to force family-owned-and-operated farms and businesses to close their doors for good,”  said Rep. Feenstra  . “We need to pass the Death Tax Repeal Act to permanently eliminate the death tax and ensure that our families, farmers, and small businesses can keep more of their hard-earned money. Serving on the Ways and Means Committee, I will continue to fight for tax relief for Iowans and work to reauthorize the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that grew our economy and lowered costs.”

LINCOLN, NEBRASKA –  Today, U.S. Congressman Mike Flood issued a statement after U.S. President Joe Biden, who is set to leave office within days, issued a statement regarding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). 

“President Biden’s attempt to give the impression that he’s unilaterally amending the U.S. Constitution is a shocking display of overreach in the waning days of his presidency. States, including Nebraska, have declined to ratify or have rolled back their ratification of the ERA. As recently as December, the National Archivist issued a statement confirming that the ERA is not recognized as a part of the Constitution. President Biden’s statement today does not and cannot change our Constitution. It is simply a ploy to appease radical liberal activists, which will only serve to undermine our rule of law and respect for the Constitution.” 

Nebraska ratified the ERA in 1972 before withdrawing ratification in 1973.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Congressman Mike Flood appeared on  The Big Money Show  on Fox Business. As Chairman of the Financial Services Committee’s Housing and Insurance Subcommittee, Rep. Flood addressed key home insurance questions and concerns stemming from the wildfires in California. The segment can be found  here  (link is external)  . Highlights from the interview are provided below. 

Rep. Flood:  First and foremost, we want to take care of the people of California. This is an important state, and we have neighborhoods that have been ravaged—it’s a real disaster. There is a genuine concern on the part of all members of Congress, regardless of party. I do think it is fair, though, to ask questions about forestry management… to say to the Department of Insurance in California, “Why are we in such a bad spot?” 

\--- 

Rep. Flood:  California’s Department of Insurance hasn’t allowed insurance companies to adequately price the risk. And as a result, you’ve had major insurance companies pull out of that state, saying, “We simply lose money.” Its Insurance Department is a disaster, and as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, I fear that after the fires are dealt with, we are going to deal with a problem that will compound itself over the next couple of months. This is a real problem.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Congressman Mike Flood issued a statement after voting in favor of H.R. 28, also known as the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. 

“The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act gives the next generation of young American women the same opportunities as their mothers had to compete on a fair playing field. Helping young Americans participate in athletics based on their biological sex is just common sense. While the Biden Administration tried to force schools to allow students who are biologically boys to compete in girls’ sports, times are changing. The incoming Trump administration and congressional Republicans will continue to fight for the next generation of women as we work to safeguard our schools and institutions against gender ideology.” 

The bill, which Rep. Flood supported in the previous Congress before it stalled in the Senate, upholds Title IX and protects women’s sports by prohibiting federal funding for events organized, sponsored, or facilitated by organizations that permit biological males to compete in women’s sports.

New York Has Third Largest Concentration of Puerto Rican People Outside the Island 

Read the Letter  Here 

Washington, D.C.  – Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10) today sent a letter to Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Adrianne Todman urging HUD to reestablish its San Juan Field Office jurisdiction to Region II in New York in order to safeguard Puerto Rican interests ahead of the incoming administration. 

“Given New York's historic, economic, and familial ties to Puerto Rico, along with the presence of numerous key federal offices for Puerto Rico in New York, transferring HUD’s jurisdiction to Region II will streamline and improve services for the Puerto Rican diaspora,”  the Congressman wrote. 

The Congressman explained that currently, the San Juan field office's placement under Region IX in Atlanta, Georgia often causes confusion and delays with interagency and stakeholder communication. The Congressman argued that because key federal agencies for Puerto Rico have regional offices in New York, including the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, FEMA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a jurisdiction change to Region II in New York would dramatically improve efficiency in interagency coordination. 

“I am confident that you will understand the need for this realignment to help protect the interests of the Puerto Rican people. I urge you to take action and return HUD’s San Juan Field Office jurisdiction to Region II in New York,”  the Congressman concluded. 

Read the letter  here  or below: 

Dear Acting Secretary Todman, 

I first want to acknowledge the work you have done on behalf of the Puerto Rican people. During your time as Acting Secretary, HUD conducted an investigation to ensure that funds appropriated to the Puerto Rico's Community Energy and Water Resilience Installations Program addressed the energy and water vulnerabilities of the low- and moderate-income citizens, and secured funding for Puerto Rican families to address the lead hazards in their homes. I am writing to you today in hopes that you will continue to safeguard Puerto Rican interests before the new administration takes office by reestablishing HUD’s San Juan Field Office jurisdiction to Region II in New York. 

Currently, the San Juan field office is under the jurisdiction of Region IX in Atlanta, Georgia. The jurisdiction's placement under Region IX causes confusion and delays with interagency and stakeholder communication. Given that key federal agencies for Puerto Rico, including the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, FEMA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have regional offices in New York, a jurisdiction change to Region II in New York would dramatically improve efficiency in interagency coordination. 

Puerto Ricans have been migrating to New York City in pursuit of employment opportunities since the 1930s. According to the 2020 Census, 25% of New York’s Hispanic population is Puerto Rican, making it the second largest concentration of Puerto Rican people in the United States and the third largest outside of the island itself. Now, many Puerto Ricans work for New York’s city, state, and federal governments. Given New York's historic, economic, and familial ties to Puerto Rico, along with the presence of numerous key federal offices for Puerto Rico in New York, transferring HUD’s jurisdiction to Region II will streamline and improve services for the Puerto Rican diaspora. 

I am confident that you will understand the need for this realignment to help protect the interests of the Puerto Rican people. I urge you to take action and return HUD’s San Juan Field Office jurisdiction to Region II in New York.

Read the Letter  Here 

Washington, D.C. –  Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10) and Congressman Jamie Raskin (MD-08) today led their Democratic House Judiciary colleagues in sending a letter to Attorney Merrick General Garland urging him to dismiss the Department of Justice’s cases against Trump’s codefendants in order to release ‘Volume 2’ of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s report on President-elect Trump’s classified documents case. 

Though Smith’s report on Trump’s actions in the lead-up to January 6  th  is now public, federal Judge Eilleen Cannon is currently blocking the release of 'Volume 2’ of the report detailing Trump’s classified documents case, citing the report's potential to prejudice the ongoing cases against Trump’s codefendants. Dismissing the charges against those two codefendants would address Judge Cannon’s concerns and allow the report, which includes non-public information on Trump’s motivations for stealing the documents and what he intended to do with them, to be made available to the public. 

“It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public. As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump’s co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira,”  the members said. 

‘Volume 2’ of the report includes damaging information currently unknown to the public detailing why Trump stole the classified documents from the White House after leaving office and what he intended to do with them. While Volume 1 – detailing his attempts to overturn the 2020 election – was released on Tuesday night, Trump has been successful in delaying the release of Volume 2 by citing the cases against his two codefendants, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. 

“The DOJ has taken the position that it will not publicly release the report so long as Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira’s criminal proceedings remain pending. While we understand your honorable and steadfast adherence to Mr. Nauta’s and Mr. De Oliveira’s due process rights as criminal defendants, the practical effect of this position is that Volume 2 will almost certainly remain concealed for at least four more years if you do not release it before President-elect Trump’s inauguration on January 20,”  the members continued. 

Following President-elect Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, the Department of Justice was forced to dismiss all charges against him due to their longstanding policy of not prosecuting sitting presidents. Mr. Trump has therefore escaped any criminal punishment related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his attempts to steal classified documents. 

“Mr. Trump’s 2024 victory saved him from a public trial and robbed the American people of the opportunity to learn the meaning and details of his unpatriotic, reckless, and intentional abuse of national security information. The public interest, however, now demands that the President-elect must not escape accountability to the American people. Accordingly, to the extent the tangential charges against Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira stand in the way of the overriding imperative of transparency and truth, the interests of justice demand that their cases be dismissed now so that the entirety of Special Counsel Smith’s report can be released to the American people,”  the members concluded. 

Read the full letter  here  or below. 

Dear Mr. Attorney General: 

We write to urge you to publicly release Special Counsel Jack Smith’s full report on 

President-elect Donald Trump’s refusal to return classified documents after he left office. 

Over the course of your tenure, in the spirit of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) strong 

commitment to independence and transparency, and consistent with the Department’s regulations and historical practices, you have released, in full, without any redactions, three special counsel reports: Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report regarding President Biden’s possession of classified documents, Special Counsel David Weiss’s report regarding Hunter Biden’s tax and gun offenses, and Volume 1 of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s report regarding President Trump’s efforts to remain in power after losing the 2020 presidential election. 

The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith’s report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records. It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public. As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump’s co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. 

To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these 

defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors, those concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report. Mr. Trump has not been secretive about his plans to weaponize the DOJ for his own personal whims and preferences. He has promised to name a Special Prosecutor to target political opponents, stated he would use the Department to prosecute his enemies, and threatened to “direct the DOJ to investigate” progressive district attorneys who have not supported his personal agenda. And of course, we are all aware that his administration plans to give “loyalty tests,” only extending government positions to those who pledge to put Donald Trump’s interests above the Constitution. 

Donald Trump has made it clear that he does not want Special Counsel Smith’s report to see the light of day and has repeatedly sought to prevent disclosure of any part of it. Just two days ago, his lawyers filed a motion—once again—to prevent the public disclosure of both Volume 1 and Volume 2 of his report. Although Volume 1 was released publicly Tuesday night, consistent with the orders of both Judge Eileen Cannon and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Volume 2 remains the subject of litigation. Judge Cannon has scheduled a hearing for January 17 to hear arguments from the litigants regarding the release of Volume 2, and the DOJ has taken the position that it will not publicly release the report so long as Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira’s criminal proceedings remain pending.9 While we understand your honorable and 

steadfast adherence to Mr. Nauta’s and Mr. De Oliveira’s due process rights as criminal defendants, the practical effect of this position is that Volume 2 will almost certainly remain concealed for at least four more years if you do not release it before President-elect Trump’s inauguration on January 20. 

Based on a review of court filings by the Special Counsel, this report presumably not 

only outlines the evidence supporting the 40 felony counts against Mr. Trump related to willfully hiding and mishandling extremely sensitive national defense information, but also explains why President-elect Trump retained and concealed classified documents and what he intended to do with those materials, neither of which was included in the indictment. It is essential that the American people and Congress understand how Mr. Trump handled our nation’s most sensitive classified information, especially because he will be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief and takes leadership of our national security apparatus in just five days. 

We obviously do not condone the sycophantic, delinquent, and criminal behavior that Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira are charged with. However, Donald Trump was plainly the mastermind of this deception operation to conceal and abuse classified material, a fact made clear by his being charged with 32 counts of willfully retaining these classified documents while his co-defendants were charged with lesser offenses related to obstructing the investigation, largely at Mr. Trump’s direction. By virtue of DOJ policy prohibiting the indictment or prosecution of a sitting president, Mr. Trump has dodged any criminal accountability for his own wrongdoing. Mr. Trump’s 2024 victory saved him from a public trial and robbed the American people of the opportunity to learn the meaning and details of his unpatriotic, reckless, and intentional abuse of national security information. The public interest, however, now demands that the President-elect must not escape accountability to the American people. Accordingly, to the extent the tangential charges against Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira stand in the way of the overriding imperative of transparency and truth, the interests of justice demand that their cases be dismissed now so that the entirety of Special Counsel Smith’s report can be released to the American people.

"This long overdue hostage and ceasefire agreement is the first step towards an end to this conflict, which can now lead to a future of peace, security, and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians without the looming threat of Hamas, the terrorist group that executed the worst attack in Israel’s history on October 7. 

"I am grateful for the leadership of President Biden and his national security team, who have worked persistently and steadfastly through very difficult circumstances to reach this day. Although Hamas repeatedly declined to agree to the framework of this ceasefire agreement that President Biden announced in May of 2024, the unyielding and ironclad alliance between the United States and Israel ultimately persuaded Hamas to capitulate. 

“With this agreement, the Palestinian people can receive an influx of humanitarian aid and the international community can join together to rebuild Gaza with self-determination for the Palestinian people who have been horribly treated by Hamas. I urge our government to join forces with allies around the world – and especially in the Middle East – to help restore peace and security in the region. 

“As we enter the first of three phases of the agreement, I am committed to upholding the conditional ceasefire and ensuring that every person impacted by this conflict, Israeli or Palestinian, is free from the horrors that Hamas unleashed. We will not stop until every hostage is home.”

10:59:45 root         DEBUG    Titles: Congressmen Gonzalez, Fitzpatrick and Senators Hirono, Sullivan Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Support Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
10:59:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
10:59:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Vicente Gonzalez (TX-34) and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01),  along with  Senator Mazie Hirono (HI) and Senator Dan Sullivan (AK)  introduced the  Veterans Member Business Loan Act  .  This bipartisan and bicameral piece of legislation expands access to capital for veteran-owned small businesses by removing arbitrary lending caps imposed on credit union member business loans. 

“I will always fight to increase economic opportunities, especially for our veterans who have given so much to protect our freedoms,” said  Congressman Gonzalez  . “The  Veterans Member Business Loan Act  is a common-sense bill that will champion South Texas veterans, equal the financial playing field, and empower them to achieve their American dream by investing into themselves and into their communities. 

"Our veterans have given their all to protect our nation, and as they shift to leading businesses within our communities, supporting them isn't just an option—it's our imperative," said  Rep. Fitzpatrick (PA-1)  . "With 60% of veteran-owned businesses facing more significant financing gaps than their civilian counterparts, the Veterans Members Business Loan Act is a critical step forward in helping them thrive by eliminating outdated and restrictive lending caps and enhancing access to essential capital. This measure does more than offer support—it is a tribute to their services and provides them with the tools they need to succeed while enriching our communities and strengthening our economy." 

“Veteran businesses play a significant role in the economy in Hawaii and across the country,” said  Senator Hirono  . “By promoting commercial lending for these businesses through credit unions, the Veterans Member Business Loan Act will give businesses increased access to capital, helping them to grow and expand while supporting the community. As they transition to civilian life, it is critical to provide our veterans with these kinds of resources to enable their success. I will continue to advocate for this legislation during the 119th Congress.” 

“Our veterans have sacrificed to serve our country and it is important that they are afforded every opportunity to succeed after leaving the military,”  Senator Sullivan  said. “Service members develop broad expertise while in the military, learning skills that can provide tremendous value to our economy. This bill eliminates common barriers of entry for veteran entrepreneurs in Alaska and throughout the country, ensuring they have access to the capital and resources needed to establish businesses and succeed in their ventures.” 

Anthony Hernandez, DCUC President and CEO,  emphasized the broader significance of the VMBL Act: "Our veterans have dedicated their lives to safeguarding our nation, our national security, and our way of life. Supporting their transition to successful business ownership is more than a financial issue; it’s a way to honor their service and contributions. DCUC thanks each of the sponsors for recognizing the importance of supporting our veterans in the true spirit of bipartisan collaboration.” 

“The veteran community is one that demonstrates the value of grit, determination, and leadership in communities all across America. Credit unions take great pride in helping those who seek out the American dream of owning a business. At America’s Credit Unions, we support Senators Dan Sullivan and Mazie Hirono and Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick and Vicente Gonzalez for their reintroduction of the bipartisan Veterans Members Business Loans Act that would exempt loans made to veterans from the credit union member business lending (MBL) cap. We look forward to a speedy passage of this critical piece of legislation,” said  Carrie Hunt, America’s Credit Unions Chief Advocacy Officer 

A study from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy found that military service is strongly correlated with a higher probability of self-employment, with veterans being 45 percent more likely than non-veterans to be self-employed. 

Unfortunately, according to the  Institute of Veteran Military Families  (link is external)  , “accessing capital is a top challenge in starting and growing a business for 75 percent of surveyed veterans.” While veteran and non-veteran owned businesses request financing and capital at almost identical rates, veterans obtain less money than non-veterans. Additionally, veteran-owned businesses also apply for financing at higher rates than non-veteran owned businesses. Yet, veterans see lower approval rates across the top three sources of credit by 10 percent compared with non-veterans. 

The  Veterans Member Business Loan Act  would correct this shortfall, allowing an additional source of capital and ensuring veteran entrepreneurs are set up for success.

This legislation closes a glaring loophole so that any predator or criminal immigrant residing in our country has no safe haven in the United States. 

  
“Illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds – especially those who have committed sexual assault – should be immediately deported. I cosponsored the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act to make it clear that any violent illegal alien Biden let into our country should be at the top of the deportation list. This is just commonsense. Any Democrat who voted against this bill should be asked why they think illegal immigrants who have committed sexual assault should be allowed to stay in the U.S.”  \- Congresswoman Ashley Hinson    
  
Background: 

  * Aliens convicted of sex offenses or domestic violence—or those who admit to such crimes—will be deemed inadmissible to the United States. 
  * Any alien convicted of a sex offense or conspiracy to commit such an offense will face deportation.

10:59:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  \- Congresswoman Ashley Hinson (IA-02) released the following statement applauding Governor Kim Reynolds' Condition of the State address. 

  
"Tonight, Governor Reynolds laid out a bold, conservative policy agenda that will build on her previous successes. As a mom, I especially appreciate her ideas to ban cellphones in classrooms and provide necessary support to students struggling in math - she continues to be the education governor. We’re beyond lucky to have the best governor in the country—one who stands up for small businesses, protects personal freedoms, puts hardworking taxpayers first, and fights to keep Iowa the best place to live, work, and raise a family.    
  
"To no one’s surprise, our state began leading the charge in maximizing and returning taxpayer dollars to Iowans before DOGE was launched. Iowa is a shining example for fiscal responsibility and commonsense conservatism under Governor Reynolds. With a Republican trifecta in Washington, and Governor Reynolds’ leadership in Iowa, brighter days lie ahead."  \- Congresswoman Ashley Hinson

10:59:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Congresswoman Ashley Hinson (IA-02) released the below statement following the passage of H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. This bill will protect the integrity of girls’ sports.   
  
“Girls should not be forced to compete against a biological boy in sports or forced to change in the same locker room as a boy. Nor should parents have to lose sleep over whether their daughters will get a fair chance to compete in the sports they’re passionate about – let alone worry about their safety or privacy. I will continue working to protect girls’ sports and women’s spaces, and I will never bow down to the radical left’s woke ideology that defies common sense.”  \-  Congresswoman Ashley Hinson    
  
Background: 

  * Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court  struck down  (link is external)  the Biden Administration’s attempt to redefine sex in Title IX as “gender identity,” blocking the change nationwide. The ruling came months after the Biden Administration proposed a rule to make it easier for biological males to compete in women’s sports. This rule aimed to eliminate the ability for individual states – like Iowa – to protect girls’ athletics statewide. 
  * Title IX was enacted in 1972 to eliminate any discrimination based on sex for educational programs and activities. Since then, participation in female sports has increased over 1,000% at the high school level and over 600% at the post-secondary level. Title IX changed the game for women’s sports but over the past four years, President Biden has sought to erase girls’ sports. 
  * In May, Rep. Hinson joined her Republican colleagues in  introducing a bicameral resolution  recognizing October 10th as “American Girls in Sports Day” to honor female athletes who are passionate about their sports, train hard, and deserve recognition.

Dan Newhouse (WA-04). This legislation would ensure that American taxpayers are not providing federal employees with location-based pay raises if they do not work in the office. 

  
“Bureaucrats have been abusing federal telework policies for far too long. This commonsense bill ensures that federal bureaucrats can’t game the system to receive a location-based pay raise if they don’t work in the office. It’s past time for all federal employees to show up to work in person and give 100% for taxpayers."  \- Congresswoman Ashley Hinson 

  
Background: 

  * The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)  found  (link is external)  that 17 of the 24 federal agencies were using 25% or less of their headquarters building’s capacity at the beginning of 2023.

These agencies included the Social Security Administration, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
  * The bill excludes certain federal employees who telework at least one day a week from receiving raises and special locality bonuses for their office location being in a high-cost-of-living area despite working from home.

10:59:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) released the following statement tonight after President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered his farewell address to the nation:    
  
"President Biden's farewell address tonight was the culmination of his five decades of service to the American people. Over the past four years, President Biden led our nation out of one of the deadliest pandemics and worst economic crises in American history. I was proud to work with him and Democrats in Congress to build back the American economy even stronger than before the pandemic by securing historic investments to rebuild our infrastructure, revitalize domestic manufacturing, expand access to affordable health care, combat the climate crisis, build safer communities, and much more. Because of President Biden's decisive leadership and visionary Investing in America agenda, our economy saw consistent growth and a record 16.6 million jobs created since January 2021 – a far cry from the recession so many Republicans predicted.    
  
"The Biden Administration's accomplishments extend far beyond our shores. President Biden restored America's reputation as a global leader on democracy, climate change, human rights, and many of the world's other most pressing issues. From Europe to the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific, his administration strengthened our alliances around the globe so that we can better face the challenges of the twenty-first century. Crucially, President Biden rallied broad coalitions to defend Ukraine after Vladimir Putin's criminal invasion and Israel after Hamas' horrific October 7 attack.    
  
"As was the case with Harry Truman and many of our nation's most celebrated presidents, America's appreciation for President Biden will only grow with time. His accomplishments, too numerous to list in full, will continue to improve lives for generations to come. It will take decades to realize the full scope of their positive impact. It is already clear, however, that history will remember President Biden as a leader of great character who devoted his life to preserving democracy. I thank him for striving to show the country and the world that hate and fear need not define our politics and corrupt the soul of America.    
  
"It is a privilege to call Joe Biden my friend and my president. On behalf of a grateful nation, I wish him and his family all the best in the years to come."

10:59:57 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
10:59:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  – Today, Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05), U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and member of the Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and U.S. Congressmen Brad Sherman (CA-32), Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Judy Chu (CA-28) led over 130 members of Congress in writing to Treasury Secretary-Designate Scott Bessent and Internal Revenue Services’ (IRS) Commissioner-Designate Billy Long, urging them to maintain and expand the IRS’ Direct File program. The letter is signed by 26 senators and 115 members of Congress.    
  
In 2024, in red and blue states, Direct File, a new tool for taxpayers to file their taxes online for free with the IRS, helped thousands of taxpayers file accurately and securely. The program received excellent reviews and is set to expand this month to 25 states and over 30 million eligible Americans.    
  
“This program is efficient and effective, providing a vital service for millions of Americans, while also keeping their data safe from misuse,”  wrote the lawmakers  . “Congress does not need to pass legislation to continue this progress. If confirmed, we urge you to maintain and expand it.”    
  
Direct File was created to save taxpayers time and money. Right now, Americans spend $160 and eight hours on average to file their taxes, often losing a chunk of their refund to do so. Giving taxpayers the option to file for free through the Direct File program has saved filers approximately $5.6 million in federal tax preparation fees in just its pilot year and is projected to save filers $11 billion a year at scale.    
  
The 2024 Direct File pilot proved to be a success. Used by more than 140,000 taxpayers, nearly 90 percent of surveyed filers said Direct File increased their trust in the IRS, and nearly 90 percent had “above average” or “excellent” experiences with the program. Indeed, the pilot was so successful that, when the IRS announced it would make Direct File a permanent program, 13 additional states elected to offer this option to their taxpayers.    
  
“Taxpayers’ embrace of Direct File is indicative of their interest in a free, easy, private, and secure method of filing,”  wrote the lawmakers  . “We disagree with our colleagues who are calling on the President to pull the plug, harming taxpayers and undermining the work that two dozen state governments in red and blue states have done to support taxpayers for the upcoming 2025 tax filing season.”    
  
The letter notes that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, “[t]he leaders of President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have discussed trying to create a mobile app for Americans to file their taxes free with the Internal Revenue Service.” The lawmakers argue that Direct File “fits the bill.”    
  
“The Direct File pilot program has proved that it is efficient, cost-effective, user-friendly, and secure—a pilot program that already meets the DOGE leaders’ goals,”  wrote the lawmakers  . “As Mr. Musk and Ms. Ramaswamy have said, Americans deserve a simple and free way to meet their tax obligations online. Ending Direct File would hurt everyday Americans.”    
  
The over 130 members of Congress urge the nominees to work with them to maintain and expand the IRS program if confirmed.

10:59:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) released the following statement today regarding the announcement of a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas:    
  
"The hostage deal announced today between Israel and Hamas will hopefully act as a step toward securing the release of  all  98 hostages whom Hamas has held captive in Gaza for the past 467 days. The first phase of the agreement requires Hamas to release 33 of the hostages over the next 42 days. I am hopeful that we can secure the release of all the remaining Israelis and other foreign nationals taken hostage during Hamas' vicious October 7 attack through the forthcoming negotiations on the second phase of the deal. That includes the seven Americans, living and dead, still in captivity: Edan Alexander, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Gadi and Judi Haggai, Omer Neutra, Keith Siegel, and my dear friends Ruby and Hagit Chen’s son, Itay, who was killed on October 7. Not all the Americans – Itay among them – will return during this first phase, but I will not rest until their families can hold them in their arms or lay their bodies to rest to sit shiva.    
  
"Over the past 15 months, I have met with many of the hostages' families both in America and Israel and seen their grief and fortitude firsthand. I am eager to see many of them reunited with their family members in the coming weeks. For the families whose loved ones were murdered by Hamas, I hope the return of human remains brings them some degree of closure and solace.    
  
"Every day since October 7, President Biden and his top officials – including Antony Blinken, Bill Burns, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, Barbara Leaf, Amos Hochstein, Dan Shapiro, and Mira Resnick, among many others – stood steadfast in their support of Israel. I commend their tireless work with Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries to bring more hostages home and keep Israel safe. This deal was only possible because Israel, with American support, degraded the military capacity of Iran, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxies and their ability to support Hamas' terrorism against Israel.    
  
"The period since October 7 has been extremely turbulent for the region and traumatic for these hostage families and for Jews in Israel, America, and beyond. Although I remain wary given Hamas’ violation of past ceasefires, I pray this agreement will achieve its goal of alleviating this pain and restoring stability throughout the region. We must never allow October 7 to be repeated or Hamas' brutal leadership over Gaza to be restored.    
  
"We must continue our work to secure not only the remaining hostages but also Israel's long-term security."

11:00:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Representative Richard Hudson (NC-09) joined Reps. David Rouzer (NC-07) and Mark Harris (NC-08), along with Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Ted Budd (R-NC), in introducing the  Lumbee Fairness Act  (link is external)  . This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would provide long-overdue federal recognition and protections for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. 

“We must right this historic wrong done to the Lumbee Tribe and give them the full federal recognition they deserve,"  said  Rep. Hudson  . 

Joining Hudson, Rouzer, Harris, Tillis, and Budd in introducing the legislation are Reps. Valerie Foushee (NC-04), Addison McDowell (NC-06), Deborah Ross (NC-02), Greg Murphy (NC-03), Don Davis (NC-01), and Tim Moore (NC-14). 

Background 

In 1885, North Carolina formally recognized the Lumbee Tribe, and the Tribe began to seek full federal recognition in 1888. The Lumbees have deep cultural roots in North Carolina and have contributed to the state through their traditions and ambition for decades. 

Since 1988, legislation to federally recognize the Lumbee Tribe has been introduced in Congress over 30 separate times, including introduction by Rep. Hudson. Bipartisan legislation has passed the House of Representatives six times, most recently in December of last year and November 2021 during the 117th Congress.

11:00:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37)  released the following statement after President Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses: 

“For decades, the American justice system disproportionately handed down longer, harsher sentences for Black and Brown individuals compared to others convicted of similar crimes. While some of these discriminatory sentencing practices have been rolled back, the sentences of these Americans remain unchanged. 

“Today, President Biden delivered a measure of justice for nearly 2,500 people unduly targeted during the failed War on Drugs, offering these souls a fresh start and a chance to become valued members of their communities. Our justice system can often be unjust and inequitable–yet, throughout his presidency, President Biden has demonstrated an enduring commitment to rectifying historical wrongs within our justice system. 

  
“I applaud President Biden for taking this historic action as well as his Administration’s efforts to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment without purpose. We must carry on the torch passed by President Biden and pass my bill, the  Second Look Act  , to address these sentencing disparities comprehensively. As we continue to address these inequities, I will use my voice on the House Judiciary Committee to ensure that the legislation I support considers the implications for all Americans, particularly those historically excluded.”

11:00:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  — Today,  Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37)  reintroduced a resolution recognizing January 16 as Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Founders’ Day. This resolution is her first piece of legislation introduced in the 119th Congress.   
  
“On this day in 1920, our five founders didn’t just build a sisterhood–they built an organization born out of resistance that rejects elitism and stands firm for social justice,”  said Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove.  “Today, with over 100,000 members across 875 chapters worldwide, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. has remained unwavering in its mission–empowering Black women through scholarship, service, and Finer Womanhood. It is an honor to be Zeta Phi Beta's voice in Congress and introduce this resolution in the same city where our organization began. Here's to 105 years of excellence and counting!" 

"As we celebrate 105 years of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., our champion in Congress, Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove has honored our legacy by introducing a historic resolution recognizing our Founders’ Day as her first piece of legislation,”  said Dr. Stacie NC Grant, International President & CEO of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.  “On January 16, 1920, when segregation was alive and well, and women didn’t even have the right to vote, the five collegiate Founders of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. envisioned a sisterhood dedicated to Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, and Finer Womanhood. The Congresswoman’s leadership, sisterliness, and commitment to advancing our mission honors the vision of our Founders by her commitment to transforming communities and embracing the Extraordinary Power of S.H.E. by advocating for Social, Health, and Economic Justice both domestically and globally." 

Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove crossed into Zetaland in the Spring of 1994, joining the Glamorous Gamma Lambda chapter at the University of Southern California. Currently, she is a proud member of the Alpha Psi Zeta alumni chapter in Los Angeles. Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove spoke on the House Floor to recognize Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Founders' Day, which can be found  here.  (link is external)

11:00:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today,  Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37)  released the following statement following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, brokered by President Biden:   
  
“For over a year, our community has been upended by the conflict in Israel and Gaza. Following Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack, my Jewish and Israeli constituents have feared for the safety of their loved ones in Israel, experienced existential dread concerning the hostages, and faced a disturbing surge in antisemitism worldwide. These feelings of profound pain, sorrow, and anguish are shared by my Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim constituents, who have been distressed over the well-being of their loved ones, devastated by the harrowing scenes in Gaza, and confronted with increased racism and Islamophobia.   
  
“I have been heartbroken by the toll this conflict has taken on my constituents and innocent civilians in the region. That is why I have long advocated for a bilateral ceasefire to bring home the hostages, protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and lay the groundwork for sustainable peace in the Middle East. I am relieved that today, Israel and Hamas have at last agreed to a ceasefire deal thanks to the relentless diplomatic efforts of the Biden Administration. This deal lays out a path that, if fully implemented, will bring all the hostages home, end the war, and provide for the reconstruction of Gaza and a new future for Palestinians free from Hamas’ rule. I urge the next Administration to work closely with our partners to ensure each phase of the deal is fully implemented. The road ahead is long, but finally, all those impacted by this conflict have a chance to begin the healing process. Now is when the real work begins.”

11:00:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today, the House Democratic Caucus appointed  Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37)  to serve on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the 119th Congress. Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove is a returning member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of four new Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee.   
  
"I am honored to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, where I will champion the issues I have advocated for throughout my career: criminal justice reform, civil rights, abortion access, and protecting the creative economy of Los Angeles. These are not just policy issues– they are the most urgent concerns of my constituents. My district’s commitment to building a fairer, more just, and equitable society for all will guide my work on this Committee."   
  
Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove introduced several pieces of original legislation that were referred to the House Judiciary Committee during the 118th Congress. She passed the  GRATEFUL Act  (link is external)  , which, to date, has issued nearly 4,300 visas for locally employed U.S. embassy staff to immigrate to the United States after a career of service to the U.S. She also introduced the  Pregnant Women in Custody Act  (link is external)  , which would ensure that pregnant women receive quality care while incarcerated, and the  Sexual Abuse Services in Detention Act  (link is external)  , which would expand emotional support services for sexual abuse survivors in prisons, jails, and detention facilities.   
  
“I am excited to continue serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where I proudly represent many vibrant diaspora and immigrant communities in California’s 37th District. The experiences of my constituents illustrate the urgent need for continued U.S. leadership on global issues such as climate change, democracy, economic development, and human rights. At a time where our greatest adversaries are increasingly working together, we cannot revert to isolationism–I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure the U.S remains a steadfast partner on the world stage.”   
  
Through her work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove has pushed for continued diplomatic engagement with our Latin American and Caribbean partners by passing the  Summit of the Americas Act  (link is external)  , helping  secure the release of Eyvin Hernandez  (link is external)  from wrongful detention in Venezuela, and strengthening ties with South America’s largest democracy as Co-Chair of the  bipartisan Brazil Caucus  (link is external)  .   
  
Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove has also prioritized engagement with African partners by introducing the  Young African Leaders Initiative Ac  (link is external)  t, which encourages the development of young leaders and entrepreneurs across the African continent, and the  African Diaspora Council Act  (link is external)  , which codifies the President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States.

11:00:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  \-  Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Suffolk County  ), the husband of a former Division One athlete and father of three young girls who play team sports, released the following statement after cosponsoring and voting to pass  H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  (link is external)  which protects the integrity of women’s rights under Title IX and ensures fair competition in women’s and girls’ sports. 

“As the father of three young girls and husband to a former Division One athlete, I am proud to support the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. This commonsense bill ensures that women’s and girls’ sports remain on a level playing field, preserving the integrity of competition and safeguarding the rights of female athletes guaranteed to them under Title IX, ”  said LaLota.  “An administration should never have had the opportunity to make such a significant determination unilaterally, especially when it comes to changes to Title IX, which has long protected the rights of women and girls in sports. Allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports compromises fair competition and denies young women the opportunity to develop physically and mentally as athletes and deprives them of educational opportunities. Girls' sports should be reserved for biological girls and by upholding the integrity of Title IX, we protect the future of girls' sports and ensure that every young woman has the opportunity to succeed and excel." 

Background: 

H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act  (link is external)  would ensure that school athletics comply with the intent of Title IX to protect individuals from sex discrimination based on the person’s reproductive biology. Additionally, this bill would ensure that biological females compete against other biological females in women’s sports that are funded through Title IX. 

Title IX bans sex discrimination in public schools, colleges, and universities that receive federal funding and is best known for protecting girls from discrimination in sports. In June 2022, the Biden administration proposed changes to Title IX that would prohibit schools from discriminating against transgender students. The proposed rule was pulled in December 2024 after significant backlash and overwhelming opposition. 

The proposed rule underscored the pressing need for Congress to take legislative action to clarify Title IX's scope and application, ensuring that its protections are consistently applied across administrations.

11:00:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:00:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: SUFFOLK COUNTY, NY  \-  Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Suffolk County  ) released the following statement following his meeting with President Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago. 

“This Saturday, I joined President Trump and colleagues from New York, New Jersey, and California at Mar-A-Lago to address critical issues impacting Long Island including congestion pricing and increasing the SALT cap. I left the meeting optimistic, as President Trump renewed his campaign pledge to ‘fix’ the SALT cap and support my constituents who suffer under the nation's most burdensome state and local taxes, a direct result from ineffective and incompetent Democratic governance in New York,”  said LaLota.  “Together, we are dedicated to devising a solution that will make life more affordable for America's middle class and improve the quality of life for hardworking Long Islanders.” 

Background: 

New York holds the unenviable position of having the  highest effective tax burden in the nation  (link is external)  , a direct consequence of the ballooning state budget under single-party Democratic rule since 2018. This budget, growing at a rate double that of inflation, surpasses Florida's despite New York's smaller population. The repercussions are stark: New York leads the country in residents relocating to more economically prudent states like Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 

This fiscal mismanagement by New York Democrats has resulted in an excessive dependence on the federal State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. This deduction permits taxpayers to offset their federal taxable income with the amount paid in state and local taxes. However, the 2017 tax reform, spearheaded by President Trump, capped these deductions at $10,000, intensifying the tax burden for New Yorkers. This cap underscores the urgent need for fiscal reform in the state to alleviate the pressures on its taxpayers. 

In 2022  (link is external)  , despite their initial pledge of "No SALT, no deal," House Democrats did not follow through before the final vote on the Inflation Reduction Act. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Nevertheless, they did not address the $10,000 cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, missing a crucial opportunity to fulfill their promises to alleviate the tax burdens on their constituents. This inaction occurred even as they held the legislative power to potentially make significant changes to the policy. 

Since being sworn into office in January 2023, LaLota has  been explicitly clear on his support  (link is external)  for restoring the SALT deduction. LaLota joined the bipartisan SALT Caucus and, in March 2023, introduced the  SALT Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act  to effectively bring the deduction to pre-2017 levels for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers while at the same time reducing the federal deficit by raising and extending the SALT deduction cap to $60k for single filers and $120k for joint filers beginning in 2023 and lasting until December 31, 2032. 

In January 2024  , LaLota voted against the Wyden-Smith tax bill because it failed to include an increase on the cap to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. In February 2024, LaLota introduced the  SALT Marriage Penalty Elimination Act  to the floor of the House. Unfortunately, 18 Republicans, together with every single House Democrat, blocked further consideration, debate, and a final vote on the measure. The  SALT Marriage Penalty Elimination Act  would remove the marriage penalty and raise the SALT deduction cap to $20,000 for joint filers and cap adjusted gross income at $500,000.

Nick LaLota (R-Suffolk County)  released the following statement after voting to pass  H.R. 29, the Laken Riley Act  (link is external)  , which increases the federal government’s accountability for public safety and extends the Department of Homeland Security’s power to detain undocumented immigrants suspected of criminal offenses. 

"Laken Riley’s tragic and preventable murder is a stark reminder of the urgent need to enforce our immigration laws,"  said LaLota  . "The Laken Riley Act ensures that individuals who are in the country illegally and commit crimes like theft or burglary are detained and removed, preventing them from re-offending and endangering others. By holding federal officials accountable for enforcing the law, this legislation places the safety of American families and communities first. I was proud to join my colleagues in passing this vital bill to honor Laken’s memory and help prevent future tragedies." 

To read the full text of the legislation, click  HERE  (link is external)  . 

Background: 

In 2024, LaLota joined his colleagues to pass the  Laken Riley Act in a vote of 251-170  (link is external)  . 

The  Laken Riley Act  (link is external)  would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest illegal aliens who commit theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting offenses and mandate that they be detained until they are removed from the United States so they cannot re-offend and commit further crimes. Additionally, this legislation would ensure that states have the standing to bring civil action against federal officials who refuse to enforce immigration law or who violate the law. 

On February 22, 2024, while jogging on the University of Georgia campus, 22-year-old Laken Riley was tragically murdered. Her body was discovered in a wooded area near Lake Herrick in Oconee Forest Park, with the cause of death determined to be blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. The perpetrator, José Antonio Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan man who had entered the United States illegally in 2022, was arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including felony murder, malice murder, and aggravated assault with intent to rape. In November 2024, Ibarra was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

11:00:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  \-  Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Suffolk County)  ,  released the following statement after reintroducing his No Bailouts for Sanctuary Cities Act for the 119th Congress. This Rules package, voted on last week for the 119th Congress, included language to bring top priority bills to the floor, including this legislation. LaLota, a former member of the Committee on Homeland Security, originally introduced the bill in the 118th Congress where it passed the House after receiving votes from every House Republican and 12 House Democrats. 

“Sanctuary cities have chosen to defy federal immigration law, creating their own crisis. It’s unacceptable for federal taxpayers to bail them out for these reckless and misguided policies,”  said Rep. Nick LaLota  . “My No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act ensures that federal dollars won’t subsidize the costs of prioritizing illegal immigration over the safety and well-being of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens. This bill, which earned bipartisan support from every House Republican and 12 House Democrats last Congress, sends a clear message: there are consequences for defying the rule of law.” 

To read the full text of the bill, click  HERE  (link is external)  . 

###  Background: 

The  No Bailouts for Sanctuary Cities Act  takes aim at ending the federal government’s pattern of throwing money at the migrant crisis without addressing its root causes. This legislation prohibits federal funding for any jurisdiction with sanctuary city policies to aid or address the migrant crisis. This includes funding for food, shelter, healthcare services, legal services, and transportation costs. 

Rep. LaLota’s bill passed the House in September 2024 with bipartisan support but stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. In the new Congress, House Republican leadership has prioritized this legislation by including it in the recently passed House  Rules Package  . This package sets the procedural and legislative framework for the House over the next two years and highlights 12 priority bills, including LaLota’s  No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act  , for expedited floor consideration. 

Since December 2024, more than 210,000 migrants have passed through New York City, including over 58,000 with criminal records. The strain on resources is undeniable. According to a recent Siena College Poll, 82% of New Yorkers view the influx of migrants as a serious problem, with over 50% calling it a very serious problem. Even Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul have conceded, “We don’t have capacity.” 

In August 2024, Rep. LaLota took action by leading a letter to Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams, opposing reports of plans to use locations across New York State to house unvetted and unlawful migrants. This effort underscores his commitment to holding sanctuary cities accountable and protecting taxpayer resources.

This legislation empowers Law Enforcement with research, information, and technologies to find and eliminate dangerous drugs infiltrating America’s communities. 

“I’m incredibly proud that my bipartisan, bicameral DETECT Fentanyl and Xylazine Act has been signed into law. This legislation is a critical step in combating the devastating epidemic of illegal narcotics flooding into our country, tearing apart families and communities,”  said LaLota  . “This bill gives our dedicated Law Enforcement officers the tools they need to fight these deadly drugs and protect American lives. I will continue fighting for public safety and taking bold steps to prevent further tragic and unnecessary loss of life.”

Background: 

This legislation initially  passed  the House of Representatives on September 9th, 2024. After the Senate amended the legislation, it passed the Senate on December 12th, 2024. Upon amendment, the measure was required to pass the House of Representatives again before it was sent to the President’s desk. The bill was signed into law on December 24th, 2024. 

The  DETECT Fentanyl and Xylazine Act  (link is external)  will: 

  * Create a new statutory responsibility for the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) at the Department of Homeland Security to carry out research, development, testing, evaluation, and cost-benefit analysis to improve the safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of drug detection equipment and reference libraries used by Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies; 
  * Establish three focus areas with flexibility to adopt other focuses in the future: (1) Portable detection equipment that requires minimal handling of sample; (2) Equipment that can separate complex mixtures with low concentrations of drugs and high concentrations of cutting agents into parts to enable detection; and (3) Technologies that use AI and machine learning to predict whether a substance is a controlled substance analog (e.g., a fentanyl analog) or other new psychoactive substance not yet included in a reference library; 
  * Require S&T to follow the recommendations, guidelines, and best practices set out in the federal government’s  Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework  (link is external)  ; and 
  * Direct S&T to look to the DEA’s State and Territory  Report  (link is external)  on Enduring and Emerging Threats in establishing priorities. 



The Senate’s amendments to the legislation are as follows: 

  * Adds language specifying that the activities in this bill under the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate must be carried out in coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 
  * Emphasizes improving not just the equipment but also the effectiveness and efficiency of reference libraries, explicitly stating these efforts should be for accurate detection. 
  * Mandates the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to base research and development priorities on specific drugs identified as threats in documents like: 
    * The latest Homeland Threat Assessment (DHS). 
    * The latest State and Territory Report by the DEA. 
  * Includes a rule of construction to clarify that the bill does not limit current agency authorities managing drug-related equipment and reference libraries. 



This legislation is endorsed by the National Association of Police Organizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the NYPD, the National Border Patrol Council, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition, Shatterproof, the National HIDTA Directors Association, and the National Association of Counties.

11:00:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  \-  Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Suffolk County)  ,  released the following statement after he introduced the bipartisan  Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act  (link is external)  with Congressman Joe Courtney (D-CT), the  Mobile Post Office Relief Act  (link is external)  , and a  Resolution expressing opposition to the Central Business District Tolling Program of New York City  (link is external)  with Representatives Andrew Garbarino (R-Suffolk County), Mike Lawler (R-Westchester), and Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island). 

“Long Island deserves strong support from Washington, and I am proud to have introduced three critical bills to address pressing issues affecting our communities. In this new Congress, I remain focused on advancing common-sense solutions that safeguard Long Island’s future and enhance our quality of life,” said LaLota. “My bipartisan  Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act  (link is external)  reauthorizes vital programs to preserve and protect our coastlines, ensuring the Sound remains a cherished resource for generations. The  Mobile Post Office Relief Act  (link is external)  demands accountability for the closure of the Sound Beach Post Office and reaffirms the Postal Service's responsibility to provide timely mail delivery and exceptional customer service.

###  Background: 

Last Congress, LaLota introduced the  Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act  (link is external)  in partnership with his Long Island Sound Caucus Co-Chair, Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) and the bill  passed the House with bipartisan support in July 2024.  (link is external) 

The  Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act  (link is external)  would reauthorize Long Island Sound restoration programs through 2029. In 1985, Congress created the Long Island Sound Study (LISS) to identify and address the major environmental problems affecting the Long Island Sound. The LISS brings together the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), New York State, Connecticut, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions to help restore and protect the Long Island Sound, including the watershed, which spans up towards New Hampshire and Vermont into Canada. 

LaLota  secured $40 million in federal funding  for the Long Island Sound Program. This funding for the Sound is provided by the Interior and Environment Appropriations bill LaLota helped pass which was signed into law in March. 

In January 2024  , LaLota testified at a Natural Resources Committee hearing in support of his Long Island Sound Stewardship and Restoration Reauthorization Act.  That same month  (link is external)  , LaLota testified at the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in support of reauthorizing the Long Island Sound grant programs via the biannual Water Resources Development Act. 

Rep. LaLota also led the charge to provide relief to residents of Sound Beach, who have been without local postal services for nine months, by introducing the  Mobile Post Office Relief Act  (link is external)  last Congress. The  Mobile Post Office Relief Act  (link is external)  would require the United States Postal Service (USPS) to provide a mobile retail unit to provide retail postal services, including Post Office (PO) Box services, to an area when the post office is temporarily closed. The Mobile Post Office Relief Act would provide a meaningful solution to the lack of action by the USPS in restoring Post Offices across the United States which have been closed for excessive amounts of time. 

On May 26, 2023, residents of Sound Beach, NY were informed by the U.S. Postal Service that their post office location would temporarily close. LaLota sent  several letters to the USPS  Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, to request an immediate, temporary postal service solution to the closure. In December of 2023, LaLota introduced the  Mobile Post Office Relief Act  (link is external)  to the House of Representatives. To this day, the Sound Beach Post Office remains closed. The USPS has not provided updates or timelines for reopening. 

Former Congressman Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY-4) introduced the  Resolution expressing opposition to the Central Business District Tolling Program of New York City  (link is external)  last Congress, at which time Congressman LaLota was a cosponsor. 

The  Resolution expressing opposition to the Central Business District Tolling Program of New York City  (link is external)  underscores the need for equitable and sustainable transportation policies in urban areas across the United States. This resolution disapproves of the Central Business District Tolling Program of New York City and strongly recommends New York conduct an economic impact report on the program and that relevant federal agencies and New York halt the program's implementation. The commuter tax tolling program charges drivers that enter the area designated as Manhattan's Central Business District.

Washington, D.C. - Today,  Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01)  reintroduced the  Prevent Tariff Abuse Act  (link is external)  with  Reps. Suzan DelBene (WA-01), Don Beyer (VA-08),  and a group of his Democratic colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee. The  Prevent Tariff Abuse Act  would block the President from bypassing Congress to impose unjustified tariffs or quotas that raise costs for working families. 

“President-elect Trump is threatening to impose broad and unreasonable tariffs to tax low-income and middle-class Americans, while promising another round of tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and billion-dollar corporations,”  said Larson.  “House Democrats are focused on delivering for working families, not the wealthy. We will not stand by and let the next President abuse his power to increase the prices of everyday goods. Our bill will prevent the incoming Administration from doing just that.” 

The Center for American Progress  estimates  (link is external)  that President-elect Trump’s tariff plan could increase taxes by up to $3,900 per year for the typical family. 

House Democrats have put forward proposals to cut taxes for working families and seniors while ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share. Rep. Larson has  a plan  to cut taxes for middle-income Social Security beneficiaries and is a supporter of Rep. Rosa DeLauro’s  American Family Act  , which would expand the Child Tax Credit to up to $3,600 per year for families.

Washington, D.C. - Today,  Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01)  applauded the announcement of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which includes the release of 33 hostages from Gaza. 

“I am hopeful to see a deal that will halt the catastrophic fighting in Gaza, free 33 hostages from their Hamas captors, and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to innocent civilians,”  said Larson.  “I applaud President Biden and Secretary Blinken for their tireless diplomatic efforts with our allies in the Middle East to pressure Hamas to accept a deal. I commend the President, President-elect Trump, and their teams for working together as they get ready to implement this deal. The families of hostages forcibly held by Hamas have waited for more than a year to be reunited with their loved ones, and some, whose children were brutally murdered at the hands of a terrorist organization, will never get the chance. Former Connecticut resident Jonathan Dekel-Chen's son, Sagui, continues to be held by his Hamas captors after 466 days. 

“The United States must continue to use our leverage to ensure the remaining phases of this deal are implemented, which would free the approximately 65 hostages who will still be in captivity, put a permanent end to the fighting, and rebuild Gaza. Ultimately, peace will only come from a two-state solution that gives both Israelis and Palestinians self-determination and the right to live their lives free from conflict,”  Larson concluded.

Washington, D.C. - Today,  Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01)  released the following statement after House Republicans passed a blanket federal ban on transgender women and girls participating in school sports. 

“Republicans are pushing a bill for sheer political purposes to exert control over school athletics and single out trans kids without any regard for the damaging discrimination it would cause across the board,”  said Larson  . “It is not a real solution. These issues should be dealt with at the appropriate levels. Athletic governing bodies, state and local associations, and coaches are better equipped to make sure sports remain fair and safe for all players. The Congress and the federal government should not be making these decisions when they have little understanding of the potentially devastating consequences.”

Hartford, CT -  Today,  Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01)  and  Senators Richard Blumenthal  and  Chris Murphy  joined  Governor Ned Lamont  ,  CTDOT Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto  , and  Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam  to announce $2 million in federal funding for the Connecticut Department of Transportation for the City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study. 

The federal funding comes from the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program through the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  . 

“With its focus on reconnecting communities, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we passed in Congress has created an opportunity to end the racial isolation in North Hartford and build a transportation system that connects residents across the Capitol Region. By funding engineering efforts to realign and cap Interstate 84 in Hartford, this $2 million federal investment will move us one step close to finally fixing the egregious design flaws that have robbed our communities of their potential for far too long. Revitalization will not happen overnight, and it remains one of my top priorities to correct the injustices of the past by securing funding to modernize infrastructure and promote economic opportunity for the residents of North Hartford,”  said Larson  . 

“This $2 million in federal funding is a significant milestone for North Hartford, signaling strong support to reconnect a neighborhood that has for far too long been disconnected and divided. This investment supports a collaborative and inclusive vision that will revitalize the community, create good-paying jobs, and provide relief for residents. I’m proud to have fought for this funding and will continue to work to deliver federal resources that encourage economic development across our state,”  said Blumenthal. 

"This project is about more than just rebuilding roads in Hartford—it’s about unlocking opportunities for local communities and creating a more connected future. This $2 million in federal funding will help improve traffic flow on I-84 and enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists, while opening up space for affordable housing and strengthening our neighborhoods' resilience to climate change for generations to come,"  said Murphy. 

“As we are making necessary upgrades to our infrastructure, we should use this as an opportunity to review how our highways are impacting the local host communities and make adjustments that think ahead for long-term improvements with an eye toward economic growth for people who live in these neighborhoods. Our interstates have divided Hartford’s North End from the rest of the city for generations now, and this study will give those who live in the area a voice in how we can improve these roads so they work for everyone,”  said Lamont  . 

“Funding for this study will help us advance the recommendations in the Greater Hartford Mobility Study as we look to reconnect the North End of Hartford to downtown, and undo some of the disruptions caused by the current highway system. Thank you to USDOT, Secretary Buttigieg, and our Congressional Delegation for the ongoing support on this project,”  said Eucalitto  . 

"The City Link project represents a critical opportunity to heal historical divides in North Hartford. By reimagining our infrastructure, we're not just rebuilding roads, but reconnecting communities and creating pathways for economic opportunity. This $2 million federal investment will help us address long-standing inequities and give North Hartford residents a voice in shaping their neighborhood's future,"  said Arulampalam  . 

The City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study would complete collaborative visioning and analysis and preliminary engineering for the realignment, lowering and capping of Interstate 84 and the Hartford Line rail corridor in Hartford. The surrounding neighborhoods have long experienced historic disinvestment and are home to disadvantaged communities that have borne the brunt of the negative effects associated with the construction of the original highway in the mid-20th century.

Washington, D.C. –  Today,  Connecticut’s Congressional Delegation  urged farmers in Connecticut to report losses from extreme weathers events in 2023 and 2024 to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture (CT DoAg). Farmers can report losses  here  (link is external)  . 

The  Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant  (link is external)  , championed by Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, provides $220 million to states in New England, Alaska, and Hawaii to help small and medium-sized farmers receive agricultural relief or aid for losses they experienced in 2023 and 2024 from any weather event. This block grant is historic disaster aid for farmers in that it does not require having crop insurance or a national disaster declaration to receive aid. This ensures that farmers left out of our farm safety net and those who suffer losses due to an extreme and localized weather event are not left with no ability to recoup their losses. 

"We strongly encourage farmers in Connecticut to participate in the CT DoAg survey on weather-related losses from 2023 and 2024,”  the delegation said.  “This is a critical opportunity to ensure your needs are accounted for as the state prepares to distribute disaster funding for farmers. The Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant provided $220 million in disaster relief funding for farmers impacted by extreme weather events in 2023 and 2024 and is intended to help affected farmers recoup their losses from these unexpected disasters. Farmers sharing the challenges they faced—whether it’s production losses, infrastructure damage, or increased costs due to invasive species—can help CT DoAg understand the scope of the need to address it as best as they can as soon as funding is ready. Please fill out the survey if you experienced these losses – help will soon be available.” 

The survey will help the CT DoAg collect information from farmers regarding weather-related losses incurred in 2024 and 2024, as well as losses related to long-term stresses worsened by weather conditions during these two years. The data will help CT DoAg fully understand the scope of the losses so they can quickly divide and disburse funding when it is available.  The deadline to complete the survey is Sunday, January 19, 2025.

Hartford, CT - Today, members of the  Connecticut Congressional Delegation  and  Governor Ned Lamont  announced $11.6 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding from the Federal Rail Administration  (FRA) to increase and extend service along the CT  rail  Hartford Line. 

“The Hartford Line is not only providing a valuable and convenient public transit resource for people who live in central Connecticut, but it is also helping create new opportunities for economic growth and development in the towns it serves. Expanding service on this line will further make travel on this rail line even more convenient, and I appreciate President Biden and the FRA for partnering with our state to make this happen,"  said Governor Lamont. 

“I am glad to join Governor Lamont and the Connecticut delegation to announce more than $11 million in federal infrastructure funding to expand passenger rail service along the Hartford Line,"  said Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01).  "Over a decade ago, our state and delegation secured the first federal funding to build the Hartford Line. Now, it is serving 600,000 riders annually. Today’s funding is another example of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law connecting our region and expanding transit options for residents and commuters alike. We will continue to work together to create good-paying jobs and make affordable, reliable transit more accessible for all along our ‘Knowledge Corridor.’” 

“This major grant is a monumental boost for Connecticut rail – more service, more reliably and safely. It’s great news for job growth and economic progress,"  said Senator Richard Blumenthal. 

“Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this $11.6 million federal investment in the Hartford Line will help cut down on travel times and pump billions of dollars into Connecticut’s economy, all while creating good-paying union jobs and reducing our carbon footprint. This is a big win for Connecticut commuters and for communities along the Hartford Line who will enjoy the benefits of more convenient, reliable transportation and sustained economic growth for years to come,"  said Senator Chris Murphy. 

“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help Connecticut get to an economy with more jobs and higher wages to deal with the cost of living,"  said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-03).  "Today’s announcement of $11.6 million for the Hartford Line is just one more example of the benefits of federal, state, and local collaboration on transportation projects. Totaling $300 million so far from BIL, these rail investments will expand services from Hartford south to New Haven and north to Windsor Locks and Springfield, supporting our transit-oriented development goals and connecting people with jobs while bolstering our local economies.” 

“With a stop in Meriden, the Hartford Line provides accessible transit options for people living in the Fifth District and those traveling across Connecticut,"  said Rep. Jahana Hayes (CT-05).  "The Federal Railroad Administration funding announced today will continue to expand rail services and connect more travelers to safe, reliable public transit. I am thrilled to see yet another investment for our state made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.” 

“This continued and increased investment from the FRA ensures the Hartford Line and Hartford Union Station will continue to grow and provide reliable service for years to come and provide even greater connectivity to Bradley International Airport. I would like to thank the FRA, Governor Lamont, and our state and federal partners for supporting rail investments that improve quality of life in our state,"  said Connecticut Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto. 

This funding is being awarded to the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) under the FRA’s Restoration and Enhancement Program to further expand rail services and improve customer service for riders along the corridor. The federal grant will be matched by approximately $13.4 million in state funds from CTDOT. 

The overall $25 million project will increase service and reliability across the entire Hartford Line, including the rail stations in New Haven, Hartford, Windsor Locks, and Springfield, Massachusetts. 

In total, the CT  rail  Hartford Line Expanded Enhancement Project will: 

  * Add one weekday round trip from New Haven to Hartford, addressing a midday service gap of up to three hours. 
  * Increase customer service hours at Hartford Union Station by 75%. 
  * Extend the weekend 6456, 6457, 6458, and 6459 trains to Windsor Locks station. 
  * Extend the weekday 4401 train from Windsor Locks to Springfield. 
  * Continue previous 2020 funding for the addition of two weekdays trains between New Haven and Springfield. 
  * Enhance connectivity of the existing rail service along the Northeast Corridor. 



Since its inception in 2018, the CT  rail  Hartford Line has grown significantly, spurring economic development and investments throughout the corridor. More than 750,000 passenger trips were expected in 2024, the highest ridership year since the service began. 

By 2030, the CT  rail  Hartford Line Expanded Enhancement Project is projected to increase ridership by about 90,000, and saving motorists more than 100 million miles traveled, over 3.5 million gallons of fuel annually, and over 25,000 metric tons of reduced carbon emissions per year.

11:00:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  The TRUST in Congress Act would prevent all Members of Congress and their immediate family members from trading individual stocks. 

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today,  U.S. Representatives Seth Magaziner (D-RI-02)  and  Chip Roy (R-TX-21)  led 44 of their colleagues in reintroducing the bipartisan  TRUST in Congress Act,  a bill that would effectively ban Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. 

The  Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act  would reduce opportunities for insider trading by requiring Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children to either divest from individual stock holdings or move their investments into a qualified blind trust during their entire tenure in Congress. This will prevent Members of Congress from profiting off of their positions through their access to nonpublic information. 

“Trust in Congress is at an all time low, but we can strengthen the integrity of our government by ensuring Members of Congress are serving their constituents and not their stock portfolios,”  said Rep. Seth Magaziner  . “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan, commonsense bill with Representative Chip Roy to ban Members of Congress — and their families — from trading individual stocks, so that we can hold Washington accountable to the people it serves.” 

“The American people should have faith that Congress is at work for the good of the country, not for their own bank accounts. For years I have been working to address the problem of stock trading in Congress, first introducing the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act with Rep. Spanberger back in 2020,” said  Representative Chip Roy  . “Now that Abigail has retired, I am proud to reintroduce this critical and bipartisan legislation alongside my friend Rep. Magaziner (D-RI). We have a long road ahead to address it this Congress, but we can and should fix the problem during this term. We have the will and the mandate of the American people to do this. Let's deliver.” 

The  TRUST in Congress Act  was originally introduced by Representative Chip Roy (R-TX) and former Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) in 2020. 

The  TRUST in Congress Act  will: 

  * Require all current Members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children to divest from certain investment assets or place them into a qualified blind trust within 180 days after the enactment of this legislation. New Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, would be required to place covered investments into a qualified blind trust within 90 days of assuming office. Affected individuals can remove assets from the blind trust 180 days after the Member leaves Congress. 
  * Require all Members to either 1) certify to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate that they have established a blind trust to include covered investments or 2) certify to the Clerk or the Secretary that they do not own any covered investments. The status of these certifications would be made publicly available by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. 
  * The requirement would apply to the following types of investments: a security (including, but not limited to stocks and bonds), commodity, future, or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means such as the use of a derivative. 



The bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by 44 Members of Congress — the largest number of original cosponsors since the bill was first introduced in 2020 — including co-lead Rep. Chip Roy [R-TX-21] and Reps. Alma Adams [D-NC-12]; Don Beyer, [D-VA-8]; Greg Casar [D-TX-35]; Juan Ciscomani [R-AZ-6]; Emanuel Cleaver [D-MO-5]; Angie Craig [D-MN-2]; Elijah Crane [R-AZ-2]; Jason Crow [D-CO-6]; Sharice Davids [D-KS-3]; Suzan K.

Murphy [R-NC-3]; Jerrold Nadler [D-NY-12]; Joe Neguse [D-CO-2]; Eleanor Holmes Norton [D-DC-At Large]; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez [D-WA-3]; Scott Perry [R-PA-10]; Brittany Pettersen [D-CO-7]; Mark Pocan [D-WI-2]; Andrea Salinas [D-OR-6]; Mikie Sherrill [D-NJ-11]; Eric Sorensen [D-IL-17]; Greg Stanton [D-AZ-4]; Hayley Stevens [D-MI-11]; Dina Titus [D-NV-1]; Paul Tonko [D-NY-20]; Gabe Vasquez [D-NM-2]; and Nikema Williams [D-GA-5]. 

The  TRUST in Congress Act  is endorsed by several key advocacy and government accountability organizations across the political spectrum, including Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight (POGO), End Citizens United (ECU) Action Fund, CREW, Protect Democracy, Americans for Prosperity, National Taxpayers Union, Fix the Court, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, Government Accountability Project, and Issue One.

JOHNSTON, RI –  Overlooking the intersection of Atwood Avenue and Hartford Avenue on the steps of Johnston Town Hall, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Representative Seth Magaziner today joined Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. to deliver a $2 million federal earmark that will advance a flood mitigation project at this critical crossroad. 

Persistent and damaging flooding around Johnston Center has impacted residents and commuters for decades. The town is putting $2,080,000 in federal funds to work on a flood mitigation project to strengthen flood related infrastructure in the area and reduce the economic and environmental impacts of significant rainfall events. 

The federal earmark will help to reconfigure existing drainage infrastructure and more efficiently manage the flow of water around this intersection during and after significant rainfall events. 

“This is good news for the residents of Johnston and those who rely on this important intersection to get to school, work, the market, or any of the local stores nearby. The federal earmark I helped secure with Senator Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner will help manage flooding and reduce the impact on local roads, businesses, and homes,”  said Senator Reed  , a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who has long worked with local officials and federal agencies to address flooding in the Pocasset River Watershed. In addition to this federal earmark, Reed has helped direct an additional $12 million in federal funds to bolster flood related infrastructure and assist homeowners throughout the watershed. 

“The delegation has worked hard to make Johnston more resilient and to ensure residents have options for dealing with the frequent, severe flooding that has affected multiple areas of town,”  said Whitehouse  , Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. “We are delivering federal funding to support Mayor Polisena’s effort to help small businesses stay open, minimize storm-related property damage, and keep residents safe on the roads.” 

“Every Rhode Islander deserves to know that their families, homes, and businesses are safe from extreme weather — yet too many Johnston residents know all too well the devastating impacts of flooding to their lives and livelihoods,”  said Rep. Seth Magaziner  . “I’m proud to have partnered with Senators Reed and Whitehouse to deliver federal funding that will help mitigate flooding in Johnston and bring peace of mind to residents.” 

“Today marks a significant step forward for Johnston and our residents. This federal earmark will allow us to address the chronic flooding that has disrupted lives, businesses, and commutes for far too long. Our main intersection, where Hartford and Atwood Avenues meet, often becomes impassable during heavy rains, effectively splitting the town in two and limiting highway access. With this funding, we will implement innovative solutions like bioswales and install new piping under both streets, connecting to our existing detention ponds. While the layout of the area will look the same, its functionality during heavy rains will be vastly improved,”  said  Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr  . “I want to thank Senator Reed, Senator Whitehouse, and Congressman Magaziner for their unwavering support and collaboration in securing these funds. Together, we are making Johnston stronger, more connected, and more resilient for the future.” 

According to the Town of Johnston, chronic flooding in this area has persistently forced the closure of portions of Atwood Avenue as well as access ramps to Route 6, sometimes for days at a time. These closures have impacted residents, commuters, and the health of the local economy and environment. 

The flooding occurs when excess rain causes the Pocasset River to crest. Drainage issues along Atwood and Hartford Avenues have caused the area to be prone to flooding, with stormwater also flowing to lower-lying areas in the vicinity of Johnston Center. 

With this federal earmark, the project being carried out by the Town of Johnston will allow for the temporary storage of stormwater runoff in oversized drainage pipes until storms pass and the nearby Pocasset River returns to its normal levels. Federal funds will also be used to strengthen connections from the improved drainage system to the town’s water quality pond system. 

Johnston also plans to incorporate water quality treatment within the improved drainage system to maintain a clean, safe water supply for the surrounding communities. By protecting the quality of the town’s water supply and reducing flood-related closures and other impacts, this project will help position the town for increased economic growth. 

Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman Magaziner secured this earmark in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations law.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – This week, U.S. Representatives Tracey Mann (KS-01) and Sam Graves (MO-06) introduced the  Pony Up Act  (link is external)  , which would protect consumers by putting the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on the hook for late delivery of bills. The legislation is the first step in solving complaints from across the country that late or undelivered mail resulted in individuals being forced to pay late fees. The Pony Up Act would require USPS to pay any late fees incurred due to delayed delivery service. 

Reps. Emanuel Cleaver, II (MO-05), Mark Alford (MO-04), Mike Bost (IL-12), Mike Collins (GA-10) and Pete Stauber (MN-08) joined Reps. Mann and Graves in introducing the legislation. 

“Kansans rely on USPS to deliver their mail in a reasonable, timely manner,”  said Rep. Mann  “Unfortunately, that has not been the reality. Hundreds of Kansans have shared their concerns about their mail not being delivered in a timely manner, or in some cases, not showing up at all. My legislation holds USPS accountable and removes the burden from hardworking Kansans. When USPS fails to do its job, it should be held responsible.” 

“Constituents across my district are routinely frustrated by late mail delivery and they should be—the Postal Service isn’t getting the job done,”  said Rep. Graves.  “Folks expect their mail to show up on time, six days a week. Instead, they are constantly faced with late deliveries and it’s costing people money. If the Postal Service isn’t going to get the mail out of the processing center and to the mailbox on time, then they should pony up and pay the late fee.” 

“With extreme weather like we saw earlier this month, not to mention the complete failure of the Postmaster General’s Delivering for America Plan, families and small businesses across my congressional district continue to voice their frustration with delivery service from the USPS,”  said Rep. Cleaver  . “Not only is it preventing them from getting timely information, but it is costing them their hard-earned dollars as they face late fees due to delayed delivery on monthly bills. We need bipartisan action to ensure these costs are not levied on hardworking Americans who have no ability to prevent these delays, and I’m proud to introduce the Pony Up Act with Reps. Graves and Alford to provide relief.” 

“The Postal Service is vital, especially for the many rural communities in Missouri’s Fourth District,”  said Rep. Alford  . “The USPS has failed to fulfill their Congressionally mandated six-day delivery window. These delays carry tangible consequences; many Americans have shared accounts with delayed checks resulting in late fees on bill payments. It is only fair that the Postal Service should reimburse taxpayers for late fees accrued due to USPS delays,” 

The Pony Up Act would enable anyone who incurred a late fee due to the late delivery of a bill to file a claim for a late fee repayment. Filing for the repayment would occur online through a portal or in person at any post office. The bill would also require a report on delayed mail, giving Congress relevant and accurate information to identify the effectiveness of USPS.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Representative Tracey Mann (KS-01) voted to advance  H.R. 30  (link is external)  , the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act. The bill, which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 274-145, establishes grounds for inadmissibility and deportation for illegal migrants who are convicted of, or admit to, committing a sex crime or domestic violence. Additionally, the bill closes a loophole in immigration law that allows illegal immigrants who have been convicted of domestic violence related offenses to still enter the country. Rep. Mann released the following statement after the vote: 

“One of Kansans’ top concerns is the wide-open border,”  said Rep. Mann.  “Under President Biden’s failed leadership, more than 16 million illegal immigrants entered the country without any formal vetting or background checks. Since October 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has convicted more than 1,500 cases related to assault, battery, domestic violence, and sexual offenses by individuals in the country illegally. We cannot and should not allow women and children to be put at risk in pursuit of a radical, out of touch political agenda. I supported the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act because it is a common sense, no brainer solution to keep bad actors out of the country and keep our women and children safe.” 

Since coming to Congress, Rep. Mann has  sounded  the alarm on President Biden’s border policies. Last week, Rep. Mann  supported  the Laken Riley Act, which requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest illegal immigrants who commit crimes and detain them until they can be removed from the country. Rep Mann has supported legislation to  stop  the Biden Harris Administration from using federal land to house illegal migrants,  finish  the border wall, and hold the Administration  accountable  for failing to enforce the nation’s border laws. In May 2023, Rep. Mann voted to  advance  the Secure the Border Act of 2023, the only border bill to pass in any chamber in the 118  th  Congress. 

H.R. 30 will now go to the U.S. Senate for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, in celebration of National Religious Freedom Day, U.S. Representative Tracey Mann (KS-01) reintroduced the  Fair Assistance and Impartial Treatment of Help  (FAITH) in Small Business Act. The FAITH in Small Business Act protects the First Amendment rights of small business owners by ensuring that faith-based small businesses have the same access to business loans and programs offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as every other American business regardless of religious status, as the U.S. Constitution requires. 

“The very first amendment the Founding Fathers made to the Constitution protected the right of every American to have a faith, live that faith, and change their faith as they please,”  said Rep. Mann  . “Small business owners should not be forced to choose between  ~~~~ expressing their faith in their entrepreneurial efforts or receiving assistance from SBA. It is un-American, unconstitutional, and contrary to our DNA as Americans to limit access to federal resources because of religious beliefs. The FAITH in Small Business Act defends the rights of small business owners to freely practice their religion without fear of persecution or exclusion and ensures they are treated equally by the federal government. I am proud to increase protections for our nation’s faith-based small businesses.” 

Faith-based businesses are “businesses principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a religious or secular setting.” 

Under previous federal regulations, faith-based organizations were not eligible for seven business loan and disaster assistance programs including the Intermediary Lending Program (ILP), Business Loan programs (7(a), Microloan and 504 programs), Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP). In January 2021, the Trump Administration’s SBA  proposed  (link is external)  a rule to eliminate these restrictions consistent with the  President’s Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty  (link is external)  .  Rep. Mann’s legislation would codify this rule, protecting the religious freedom of America’s small business owners and creating an equal playing field for religious and non-religious small businesses alike.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Representative Tracey Mann (KS-01) took to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to applaud the dedication of Kansas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers for their perseverance and dedication during last week's winter storms. During his speech, Rep. Mann reminded the nation of the plight that the agricultural community faces to keep the rest of the country fueled, clothed, and fed. 

Below are Rep. Mann's remarks as prepared for the House Floor: 

Mr. Speaker, last week in the nation’s capital, 6.8 inches of snow closed federal office buildings. Nearly 1,300 miles away in Kansas, blizzards brought more than 18 inches of snowfall to parts of the Big First District. Farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers in the Big First didn’t have the luxury of closing down for the week. When you answer the call to feed, clothe, and fuel the world, you’re required to show up—even when the temperatures outside are below freezing. 

Our congressional district is one of the top agricultural producing districts in the country. It is home to more than 60,000 farms along with farmers, ranchers, feed lot managers, nutritionists, veterinarians, ethanol producers, ag lenders, and agribusiness owners who bring the agricultural ecosystem to life. When snow piles up and temperatures refuse to rise past freezing, these men and women don’t get a break. They throw on their layers and get the job done. 

Those of us in agriculture understand full well that Mother Nature is not a reliable business partner. 

At the end of October, much of my district was still navigating dry to severe drought conditions. On top of navigating an already challenging farm year, these droughts severely squeezed margins for farmers and ranchers. 

Less than two months later, Mother Nature changed course once again with more than a foot of snow. In true Kansas fashion, families and neighbors came together to help one another in a time of need. 

Kansans helped move snow to ensure livestock could still be watered and fed. Kansans helped move calves to make sure that after they were born, they could get to a warm place to be properly fed and nourished in negative temperatures. Kansans stayed up through the night to make sure livestock had a chance of surviving or to guarantee there was equipment ready to go and work by sunrise the next morning. 

Why on earth would anyone do this, Mr. Speaker? 

It’s a special calling that many families in my district have answered. 

In a world where Instacart and Amazon Fresh can deliver groceries to your door in nearly an hour if you live in an urban area, it can be easy to forget that our food doesn't come from the grocery store shelves. They come from men and women who work tirelessly day in and day out to answer the call to feed, clothe, and fuel the world. On days with lots of extreme weather like we saw last week, these men and women bust their backs to ensure that we can still have food on our plates when the storms are long gone. 

It can often be a thankless job, but on behalf of Kansans and the nation, I thank these brave men and women for keeping us fueled, clothed and fed. Your tireless efforts do not go unnoticed, and we are deeply grateful for your commitment to feed a hungry world. 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield.

WASHINGTON, D.C  .  – Today, U.S. Representative Tracey Mann (KS-01) voted to advance  H.R. 28  (link is external)  , the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. The bill, which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 218-206, ensures that women and girls have a fair playing field in sporting competitions by preventing schools from allowing biological men to compete in athletic programs for women and girls. Additionally, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act defines gender under Title IX on genetics and biology, not on identity. Rep. Mann released the following statement after the vote: 

“As a former high school athlete and a father of four young children, I understand full well the positive impact sports can have on youth and their development,”  said Rep. Mann.  “Sadly, the lessons and values taught by participating in athletic programs have been greatly eroded by Washington Democrats who have caved to radical activists under the false guises of ‘equity’ and ‘inclusion’ over fairness. As a result, women and girls have senselessly been exploited in private spaces and robbed of scholarships and accolades. American voters rejected this sort of lunacy on November 5, 2024. Today, I voted to keep men out of women’s locker rooms and sports, to preserve an equal playing field for female athletes, and to protect women across the country.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Doris Matsui (CA-07)  issued the following statement after the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip. 

“I am relieved to see a ceasefire agreement in place,”  said Congresswoman Matsui.  “At long last the fighting will halt, many hostages will be reunited with their families, and desperately needed humanitarian assistance can reach the Palestinian people. My hope is that this agreement will lead to the release of all hostages and a permanent end to the violence. I thank President Biden and the entire team of negotiators who have shown an unyielding dedication to get this deal done. Over the next six weeks and beyond, we must trust in diplomacy to lay a foundation for lasting peace in Gaza. Today’s announcement is the beginning of a long road to rebuild, break the vicious cycle of violence, and forge a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side with dignity, security, and self-determination.”

##  Declaration Follows McClellan’s 2020 Legislation to Make Virginia the 38th State to Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment 

Washington, D.C. –  Today, Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04)  issued the following statement after President Joe Biden  declared  (link is external)  the Equal Rights Amendment the law of the land as the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution after Virginia became the 38th state to ratify: 

“This announcement marks a historic turning point in the century-long fight for gender equality. In 2020, I introduced and passed legislation with Senator Mamie Locke and then-Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy to make Virginia the 38th and final state necessary to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. It was poetic justice for the Commonwealth of Virginia – the birthplace of American democracy and the former capital of the Confederacy – to fulfill the constitutional requirement to make the Equal Rights Amendment law. Despite those strides, we have had to continue working to ensure its publication in the U.S. Constitution. 

“The U.S. Constitution was developed for “We the People, in Order to form a more perfect Union” and promised to create a government by, of and for the people. But it did not include everyone. For more than 100 years, we have fought to pass the Equal Rights Amendment and bring our nation closer to the promise of equality for every American, regardless of sex. It was a fight propelled by abolitionists, the Civil Rights Movement, the Suffrage Movement, and the Women’s Rights Movement, which included women of color from the very beginning, even when we were the last to benefit from that work. I’m proud to have done my part at the state level and built on that progress in Congress as a Vice Chair of the Congressional ERA Caucus. 

“President Biden’s declaration capstones his lifelong commitment to gender equality and the rights of every American. Today, the President acknowledges the ERA as the law of the land. With this declaration, President Biden cements his legacy as a champion for women’s rights and sends a clear, unequivocal message that no one should face discrimination on the basis of sex. 

“Today, our nation takes a historic step to ensure our daughters and granddaughters will have more rights than their mothers and grandmothers did. However, it cannot be the last. Congress took nearly 100 years after ratification of the 14th Amendment to pass legislation enforcing its ban on racial discrimination. I look forward to publication of the ERA as the 28th Amendment and working to enforce its mandate as soon as possible.” 

McClellan has been a tireless advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment since her public service began in 2006 in the Virginia House of Delegates. In 2020, then-State Senator McClellan introduced and led passage of  SJ 1  (link is external)  to ratify and affirm the ERA in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In Congress, McClellan serves as a Vice Chair of the Congressional  ERA Caucus  (link is external)  . In December 2024, McClellan  joined  (link is external)  her Congressional ERA Caucus colleagues in  urging President Biden  to publish the ERA.

11:00:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  In case you missed it (ICYMI)  :  This week,  Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04)  joined  Congressman Vince Fong (R-CA-20)  to reintroduce the bipartisan ACERO Act. This legislation authorizes NASA’s Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) project, which is focused on using drones to fight wildfires, including in low-visibility conditions where manned aircraft cannot be used. 

“The devastating wildfires in Los Angeles remind us that we must leverage every available tool to strengthen our ability to respond effectively,”  said Rep. Jennifer McClellan.  “We know the climate crisis exacerbates extreme weather events and threatens our communities. The Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) Act will support NASA’s ongoing efforts to utilize drones and other technologies to help firefighters protect our communities. As we reintroduce this legislation, I look forward to collaborating with Congressman Fong to support our brave first responders and support NASA’s continued research and development.” 

“The ACERO Act is an extremely crucial and lifesaving piece of legislation,”  said Rep. Vince Fong.  “In my home state of California, we are all too familiar with wildfires that plague the state year-round. Currently, my community is sending personnel, resources, and our prayers to those who are affected by the fires devastating Southern California right now. The ACERO Act supports NASA’s development of technology that allows drones to fight wildfires alongside manned aircraft and ground crews. With this innovative technology, which NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in my district helps develop, drones can better support emergency operations, especially when there is reduced visibility such as at night and during periods of heavy smoke. I look forward to seeing this bill help firefighters nationwide combat disastrous wildfires.” 

The ACERO Act was introduced in the 118th Congress by former  Congressman Mike Garcia (R-CA-27)  and Rep. Jennifer McClellan. It was included in the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which passed the House on September 23, 2024. The bill authorizes NASA’s ACERO project to develop technology for drones to improve wildfire response operations. 

Specifically, the bill helps improve the management, deconfliction, and coordination of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles in emergency response activities, including by requiring NASA to create a unified concept of operations for the management of airspace during wildfires.

For months, I have called for a negotiated ceasefire that would end the suffering of innocent civilians in Gaza, release Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity, allow for a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and lay the groundwork for a broader peace agreement that will lead to lasting security, dignity, and sovereignty for both the Israeli and Palestinian people. I believe this ceasefire agreement meets those standards, and I strongly support the deal’s swift implementation. 

“I commend the Biden-Harris Administration for its relentless efforts to broker this agreement and reduce tensions in the region. I urge all involved parties to abide by the terms of this deal and work to uphold all phases of its implementation to ensure the peace achieved today will endure in the future. I hope this agreement serves as the first step in creating a two-state solution that brings lasting peace and stability to the region.”

The study could be strengthened by more closely evaluating the impacts of methane leakage from oil and gas wells, but its conclusion is sound: LNG exports are not a climate solution.”

Dear Secretary Granholm: 

We write to urge the Department of Energy (DOE) to use its recently updated liquefied natural gas (LNG) analysis to determine whether proposed LNG exportauthorizations to countries without a free trade agreement with the United States are in the public interest. 

American households are already struggling with energy prices, which are rising faster than inflation, and we are grateful for the clarity that the recent DOE study provides on the economic impact of continued LNG exports. The analysis shows that increasing LNG exports will raise energy prices for heating and cooling costs for both American families and manufacturers. It shows that increased volumes of U.S. natural gas exports create domestic supply constraints that will ripple through the economy, particularly raising costs for small businesses and industries that rely heavily on natural gas. 

The study also shows that increased LNG exports lead to heightened volatility in natural gas markets, leaving American consumers vulnerable to domestic andinternational price spikes, especially during extreme winters or broader geopolitical conflicts. This volatility – and its subsequent contribution to rising energy costs – could stifle job growth and further increase operational costs. These impacts not only undermine economic stability, but also threaten job security in energy-intensive sectors. 

DOE’s analysis found that continued approval of LNG export projects also threatens our ability to meet science- based emissions reduction targets by locking in decades of climate pollution and undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad. The findings show that additional U.S. LNG exports displace more renewables than coal globally. The study could be strengthened by more closely evaluating the impacts of methane leakage from oil and gas wells, but its conclusion is sound: LNG exports are not a climate solution. 

Furthermore, according to DOE’s analysis, the amount of already approved LNG is more than sufficient to meet global demand from our allies for decades to come. This underscores that while LNG exports primarily benefit the oil and gas industry, hardworking, everyday Americans pay the price. 

It is well-documented that rising energy costs disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families, as these households allocate a larger percentage – otherwiseknown as the household’s energy burden – of their income to energy expenses. Historic patterns of disinvestment in minority communities show up in today’s energy burdens: Black, Hispanic, and Native American households face dramatically higher energy burdens than the average American household. Nationally, the scale ofhousehold energy burdens is staggering: 30.6 million households face a high energy burden, while 15.9 million households experience a severe energy burden (exceeding ten percent of their income). 

DOE’s analysis shows that continuing to permit LNG export terminals is not in the public interest. It will raise prices for over 30 million hardworking American families who are already struggling with rising costs and setback the Biden administration’s manufacturing renaissance by increasing energy prices on manufacturers and other industrial users. LNG exports undermine U.S. and international climate goals and delay the deployment of renewable energy. 

We urge you to immediately incorporate these findings into the public interest determinations for all pending LNG export proposals to reflect the devastating economic and environmental impacts of such exports. We are confident that these projects are not in the public interest.

11:01:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Today, Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04)  issued the following statement after she voted against H.R. 28, the so-called “Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act”: 

“In one of their first bills of the 119th Congress, House Republicans renew their culture war attacks on the transgender community under the guise of protecting women and girls in sports. But when you pull back the curtain on H.R. 29 and think through its enforcement, serious questions arise on how far schools must go. In a blatant example of gender discrimination, the bill seeks to bar transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports. In so doing, the bill poses a real and serious risk to girls as young as four years old by subjecting them to personal questions about their bodies. More disturbingly, the bill permits physical inspection of young girls’ genitals by adult strangers, without parents present. As a mother of an elementary student, I find that possibility appalling. No child or parent should have to worry that their privacy or even their very body can be violated at any time if they even consider participating in a sport. 

“Instead of focusing on the issues that matter to the American people, House Republicans would rather capitalize on the concerning rise in transphobia and villainize a vulnerable, marginalized population. 

“Keeping sports safe and fair means letting children play without fear of being physically inspected by adults to verify their gender identity. Republicans should focus on putting people over politics, helping people, and solving the problems that are actually top of mind for the American people, not meddling in our children’s deeply personal and private matters in an effort to further stoke culture wars.” 

H.R. 28 passed/failed on a vote of 218 Yays to 206 Nays to 1 Present. Read the full bill text  here  (link is external)  and a summary  here  (link is external)  .

11:01:03 root         DEBUG    Titles: THOMPSON ANNOUNCES $4.2 MILLION GRANT TO IMPROVE RAIL CROSSING SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY IN YOLO COUNTY
11:01:03 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:01:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington – Today,  Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-04)  announced that the Department of Transportation has awarded a $4,160,000 federal grant to Yolo County to relocate and redesign a dangerous and congested railroad and roadway crossing north of Davis. 

“I’m proud to have helped secure this $4.2 million dollar grant to improve the County Road 32A and railway crossing north of Davis. The current intersection where County Road 32A and the Union Pacific Railroad’s Martinez Subdivision cross poses a danger to roadway users and backs up traffic. By moving and elevating the roadway over the train tracks, the county will enhance public safety, improve transportation efficiency, and boost local economic growth. Thank you to Supervisor Allen and City Councilmember Josh Chapman for your work on this project,”  said Thompson. 

“The people of Davis and Yolo County are excited to receive the important investment by the Department of Transportation to address road and railway safety by providing over $4 million federal dollars for the County Road 32A Crossing Relocation Project. County Road 32A provides an important connection to Davis, the Yolo County landfill, and agriculture and frontage road access. This project will improve one of the most dangerous car/railroad crossings in the region while maintaining these vital connections. We very much appreciate Congressman Thompson’s and additional regional elected representative’s support and advocacy for the project,”  said Yolo County Supervisor Sheila Allen, District 4. 

“We are very thankful for the $4.16 million grant for the County Road 32A Crossing Relocation Project,”  said Davis Councilmember and Capital Corridor Joint Powers Authority Board Member Josh Chapman  . “The project’s goal is to make the crossing safer for bicyclists and drivers and decrease the number of incidents that happen at this crossing. We are grateful for the assistance, support and advocacy of Representative Mike Thompson’s office to help make this happen." 

With this funding, Yolo County will relocate the existing County Road 32A and Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Martinez Subdivision crossing approximately 1.4 miles east of its current location. The new section of roadway will cross overhead of the train tracks with two 12-foot lanes, 6-foot shoulders with Class II bike lanes, and a trail connection to the Class I commuter bikeway connecting Davis to West Sacramento. 

This project is critical, as the current railway and road crossing's geometry poses safety and operational challenges. County Road 32A intersects with a rail line that carries many freight and passenger trains daily. This places road users at risk and increases congestion. By relocating and elevating the roadway crossing, the county will significantly reduce conflicts between trains and those using the roadway, ensuring safer travel for our community. 

County Road 32A is also a primary truck route for neighboring farms and the Yolo County Central Landfill. The new roadway crossing will accommodate farm vehicles, pulling trucks away from using nearby routes through the City of Davis and reducing community impacts. This will also improve farm-to-market access. 

Funding for this grant comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which Congressman Thompson proudly voted for to support, update, and improve our nation’s infrastructure.

“It’s concerning that the agencies in charge of researching and producing our updated dietary guidelines created a new, less transparent review process to issue alcohol consumption guidance to Americans. 

“Congress already delivered $1.3 million for the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct an objective, rigorous, and transparent study to support the 2025 dietary guidelines on alcohol. 

“ICCPUD’s duplicative study redirected the Committee’s limited resources away from its core responsibility to prevent underage drinking. Additionally, unlike the NASEM review and overall development of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines, members of ICCPUD’s Scientific Review Panel were not appropriately vetted for conflicts of interest. 

“Any health recommendations to Americans must be based on a preponderance of sound science and research that is developed in a transparent manner without any potential for conflict of interest. ICCPUD’s study does not meet these standards.”

Washington – Today,  Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-04)  announced that the Department of Transportation has awarded a $25,221,639 federal grant to the City of Dixon to construct a new “complete street” grade-separated railroad overcrossing at Parkway Boulevard. 

“I’m proud to have helped secure this $25 million dollar grant to build a complete, elevated overcrossing at Parkway Boulevard in Dixon. By elevating the roadway over the train tracks, we can reconnect the eastern and western portions of the city, provide a safer route for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists, and improve access to local schools and planned housing developments. Thank you to Mayor Steve Bird and City Manager Jim Lindley for your work on this project,”  said Thompson. 

"We're thrilled residents will have this new avenue to get to the other side of town safely. This project has been a long time coming and there were many obstacles we've had to overcome — some within our control, some outside of our control. Now, thanks to all the hard work by Congressman Thompson, STA staff, and our Dixon City staff, we have the funding we need to move forward with building the Park Boulevard Overpass. The people of Dixon are the real winners here. This project will create a safe route to school for the high school, improve public safety, and reduce response times for emergency vehicles,"  said Dixon Mayor Steve Bird. 

“We would like to thank Congressman Mike Thompson and the Solano Transportation Authority for their help in securing funding for this vital infrastructure. The Parkway Boulevard Overcrossing will improve roadway safety, provide quicker access to first responders, and a safer route to school for many children in Dixon. This grant represents a monumental opportunity for Dixon to enhance safety and connectivity within our community. We are deeply grateful to the Federal Railroad Administration for their support and look forward to the positive impact this project will have on our community,”  said Dixon City Manager Jim Lindley. 

The Parkway Boulevard Overcrossing Project will provide a vital safety connection over a passenger and freight rail corridor, ensuring safer access to Dixon High School, John Knight Middle School, and the Historic Dixon Fairgrounds. 

This project is critical to community safety, as over 40 trains per day travel through the corridor at speeds nearly 80 miles per hour. As Dixon is expected to welcome over 1,000 new families to the city by 2026, the new Parkway Boulevard crossing will reduce safety risks for those traveling across the city. 

The new crossing will also improve emergency response times, facilitate the development of new housing to help address the area’s housing crisis, and encourage more active transportation with new bicycle and pedestrian crossings. 

The new grade separated east-west connection at Parkway Boulevard will allow for the closure of the existing crossing at Pitt School Road, which is ranked in the Top Three mileposts with the Highest Rate of Incidents in the Capitol Corridor’s Martinez Subdivision. 

Funding for this grant comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which Congressman Thompson proudly voted for to support, update, and improve our nation’s infrastructure.

Washington – Today,  Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-04)  applauded the  Biden-Harris Administration  for its record-breaking work expanding health care coverage for Americans. 

“A record 24 million Americans have enrolled in health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act since November,”  said Thompson  . “More people have health insurance today than ever in our nation’s history. Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris’ leadership, the number of Americans enrolled in health care coverage through the ACA has nearly doubled over the last four years. 

“I remain committed to building on this progress, starting with extending the ACA premium tax credit this year and extending my legislation providing telehealth access to Medicare beneficiaries. Extending the tax credit is especially critical. If Congress does not extend it, 28,000 residents in our district will face an average of $1,279 more in annual premiums.” 

BACKGROUND 

The Biden-Harris Administration has set another all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 24 million Americans signing up for coverage with one week left in the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. 

A total of 45 million Americans have coverage through the ACA, either through the Marketplace or Medicaid expansion. 

Today’s milestone builds upon a remarkable record of success over the last four years. More Americans have health insurance than ever before, with the uninsured rate at record lows. The Biden-Harris Administration has set a new all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment every year since the President and Vice President took office.

That’s why I am excited to re-launch the bipartisan Congressional Kidney Caucus as a Co-Chair to increase educational awareness of kidney illnesses and remove any barriers that may prevent patients, hospitals, and donors from accessing vital resources. I look forward to working with Co-Chair Congresswoman DelBene to improve health care for kidney patients within our districts and across the United States  ,”  said Congresswoman Miller.    
  
“The Kidney Caucus made important bipartisan strides during the first Trump administration and under President Biden to improve early education, prevention, and care for people living with kidney disease, as well as investments in artificial kidney developments. We must continue to build on this progress in the next administration by encouraging innovation and research and making sure we quickly proceed with the ongoing reforms to the organ transplant system. If Congress puts more of the right tools and resources into kidney care, we can meaningfully improve the quality of life for millions of Americans, give new hope to their families, and save significant taxpayer dollars in the long run,”  said Congresswoman DelBene.    
  
Background: 

  * Over 35 million Americans are currently living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). 
  * 3,714 West Virginians are currently living with kidney failure. 
  * In the 118th Congress, Congresswoman Miller introduced several bills such as the  Kidney PATIENT Act  ,  Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act  ,  Improving Access to Home Dialysis Act  , and the  Expanding Support for Living Donors Act  to help patients and kidney donors.

11:01:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Carol Miller (R-WV) along with Representatives Harriet Hageman (R-WY), Morgan Griffith (R-VA), and Dan Meuser (R-PA) re-launched the Congressional Coal Caucus for the 119th Congress. The Congressional Coal Caucus is the voice of American coal communities in Congress, representing mining states and all types of U.S. produced coal. 

“The coal industry provides thousands of jobs for hard working Americans and keeps our nation running. West Virginia produces around 166,000 lbs. of United States’ coal. Unfortunately, this critical energy resource is under attack from far-left climate activists. That’s why I am glad to re-launch the Congressional Coal Caucus with my fellow co-chairs. We will continue our work to implement policies that strengthen the U.S. energy industry as well as our economy. I am confident that with the support of the Trump-Vance administration and Congress’ efforts, U.S. coal production will thrive,”  said Congresswoman Miller.    
  
“I am honored to return as a co-chair of the Coal Caucus for the 119th Congress and work with my fellow caucus members to ensure Americans have access to affordable and reliable energy. Coal remains a cornerstone of that energy supply now and for generations to come. In the United States, coal-fueled power plants generate about 17% of all electricity—and Wyoming produced more than 40% of the nation’s coal. The Coal Caucus is committed to working with President Trump’s administration to reclaim our energy independence and drive down costs. We must defend affordable, reliable, and clean American coal to secure our nation’s energy future,”  said Congresswoman Hageman.    
  
“I am proud to continue serving as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Coal Caucus. The continuation of the Coal Caucus is recognition that America’s coal industry has much to bring to the table. In my roles as Co-Chair of the Coal Caucus and the Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Environment, I will continue advocating for policies that promote America’s natural resources, including coal, in the production of reliable, affordable energy. With a new administration, the Congressional Coal Caucus is an energized force ready to deliver solutions for Americans’ energy needs,”  said Congressman Griffith.    
  
"I look forward to the relaunch of the Congressional Coal Caucus and to once again serving as co-chair. Coal remains a vital resource, providing nearly 20% of electricity in the U.S. and playing a key role in steel production worldwide. Through the Caucus, my co-chairs and I will highlight coal's ongoing benefits, its impact on rural communities, and innovative uses in today's economy. We are committed to advocating for policies that support the coal industry and the hardworking men and women who power it, ensuring it continues to sustain jobs and businesses across the country,”  said Congressman Meuser.    
  
Background: 

  * In 2023, Congresswoman Miller joined as a co-chair of the Congressional Coal Caucus. 
  * Goals of the Coal Caucus include: Oversight on EPA's power plant agenda, grid reliability legislation, rail service reliability, support future coal use, promote policies to facilitate coal exports, oversight on DOI’s federal coal leasing program review, and support pro-coal tax policies. 
  * The Coal Caucus Co-Chairs have released statements on a variety of key energy issues including:  ruling to end moratorium on federal coal leasing  ,  bicameral resolution to block Biden’s plan to close American power plants  , and  SCOTUS’ decision to allow the EPA to implement their Power Plant Rule  .

11:01:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Carol Miller (R-WV) participated in a Ways and Means Committee hearing on the need to make the Trump Tax Cuts permanent for working American families, farmers, and small businesses.

Congresswoman Miller began by saying the Trump Tax Cuts should be reauthorized permanently and gave an example of a successful West Virginia company that utilizes the 199A small business deduction.    
  
“I don’t think there is a more appropriate way to kick off the 119th Congress, and the Republican leadership [in D.C.], than to discuss the great success of the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts. I’m thrilled that we have a strong leader [in President Trump] who understands business and the economy. American voters have given Republicans a mandate to make permanent the great work that was accomplished in 2017.”    
  
“I’m a West Virginian, we know small business because 98.9 percent of businesses in my home state are considered small businesses. The 199A small business deduction created in the Trump Tax Cuts was transformational for the hardworking small business owners in my district. The small business deduction allows pass-through entities to receive a tax rates comparable to larger corporations, allowing small businesses to stay competitive and to reinvest in their employees and their communities. Last year, we had Michael Ervin, the founder and CEO of Coal River Coffee Company in Charleston, West Virginia come and testify before this committee about how his business has been able to utilize benefits from this deduction. This business has been able to provide raises and promotions, purchase new equipment for label making [and design], and train new coffee roasters. They were also recognized with the 2024 Small Communities Big Solutions award for revitalizing communities across West Virginia. This type of growth helps small businesses level the playing field with bigger corporations – and is happening all over my state. Workers and businesses alike are much better off because of the 199A [small business deduction], and I look forward to extending this policy as part of our efforts this next year,”  said Congresswoman Miller.    
  
Congresswoman Miller proceeded to highlight the legal problems and burdens that the IRS’ 1099-K threshold requirements have placed on Americans. She then asked Alison Couch, owner of Ignite Accounting and Business Advisors, to describe the challenges taxpayers have had complying with the uncertainty created by the Biden administration.    
  
“Not only does Congress have the opportunity to make permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts this year, but we also have the opportunity to provide additional relief for working-class Americans that were harmed by President Biden’s disastrous economic policies. One such policy was the 1099-K reporting threshold. In the misnamed American Rescue Plan Act, the 1099-K reporting threshold was changed from the time tested standard of $20,000 over 200 transactions to $600 over a single transaction. As a result, Americans using eBay or Etsy to sell or resell products, or Venmo to collect rent, are considered small businesses and will be sent 1099-K forms this upcoming tax year. Since this disastrous policy was signed into law, the Biden administration’s IRS twice delayed implementation and last year illegally changed the thresholds without Congressional authority – all because they knew how catastrophic the policy would be for average Americans and gig workers. My bill, the Saving Gig Economy Taxpayers Act, to restore the 1099-K threshold to pre-ARPA levels was cosponsored by all Republican members of this Committee and favorably passed out of Committee last Congress. I look forward to again introducing legislation to fix this problem that the Biden administration created – and provide relief to working-class Americans. Ms. Couch, you help small businesses and individuals understand these onerous 1099-K reporting requirements. Can you speak to how difficult it has been for taxpayers to understand these new thresholds amidst all of the uncertainty from the Biden administration  ?  ”  asked Congresswoman Miller.    
  
“[The 1099-K] thresholds requirements are very burdensome for small business owners who already have a lot of compliance requirements that they must do on a regular basis. There will be confusion in our industry that folks won’t understand the difference between personal and business payments through Venmo vs payment to small business owners. There’s the potential for people to receive 1099-Ks who should not be receiving them. We would like to see the threshold move the opposite direction of where they’re headed now, and we appreciate your work and bill to help small business owners on this matter,”  responded Ms. Couch.

11:01:13 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:01:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Congresswoman Carol Miller (R-WV) joined her fellow co-chairs of the Congressional Coal Caucus, Congresswoman Harriet Hageman (R-WY) and Congressman Dan Meuser (R-PA), in introducing the  Combating Obstruction Against Leasing (COAL) Act  . The Biden administration has done everything in its power to cripple the coal industry these past four years, harming thousands of jobs and U.S. energy production. This bill will streamline the process for approving coal lease applications managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) upholding federal obligations under the  Mineral Leasing Act. 

“Coal is a powerful energy resource that keeps West Virginia and our country running, but the Biden administration has made it nearly impossible to obtain a permit to have a lease or mine. The Combating Obstruction Against Leasing Act requires the Department of Interior to take necessary steps to responsibly approve applications so companies can proceed with coal mining operations. For the United States to be energy dominant, we must increase our energy supply by allowing more permits and opportunities for extraction and mining,”  said Congresswoman Miller. 

“The Biden Administration ideological assault on coal is crippling Wyoming’s energy potential and setting our nation on a path to energy poverty. The COAL Act ensures the federal government fulfills its obligation to lease public resources fairly and efficiently. I am thrilled to work with the new Trump Administration to unleash America’s full energy potential. This is a win for Wyoming, for the economy, and for the energy independence that makes America stronger and more secure,”  said Congresswoman Hageman.

Background: 

  * Radical eco-extremists spent four years and millions of dollars lobbying the Biden administration, resulting in crippling anti-energy policies. This resulted in needless regulation and blatant sabotage of our energy industry. 
  * The COAL Act mandates the Department of the Interior to act on pending coal lease applications and grant necessary approvals for mining activities.

11:01:15 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:01:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Congresswoman Carol Miller (R-WV) joined Trade Subcommittee Chair Adrian Smith (R-NE) and 10 of their Ways and Means Committee colleagues in sending a letter to United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai. The letter expresses concern regarding reports USTR is negotiating new binding interpretations of key provisions within the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The lawmakers call on USTR to refrain from finalizing any new terms for these agreements and instead use President Biden's remaining days in office to seek input from Congress and American stakeholders.    
  
Joining Representatives Miller and Smith in signing the letter are: Representatives Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), Aaron Bean (R-FL), Jodey Arrington (R-TX), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), Ron Estes (R-KS), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Rudy Yakym (R-IN), Max Miller (R-OH), and David Schweikert (R-AZ).    
  
Click  here  (link is external)  for the full letter. 

On concerns regarding the impact negotiating new agreements could have on U.S. investors: 

We write to express concern regarding recent reports indicating that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is considering revisions or new binding interpretations of the existing investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions within the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. We urge you to halt any lame-duck negotiations with foreign governments on this or other trade or investment issues and instead seek stakeholder input, consult Congress, and refrain from taking any actions that may jeopardize our national interests or create confusion with trading partners about the positions held by the current administration versus the immediately incoming administration. 

USMCA made numerous changes to investor protections included in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). However, the agreement ensured pending NAFTA arbitrations would remain unaffected and established a three-year phase-out period during which investors could pursue claims under NAFTA rules. For instance, Vulcan Materials Company reportedly relied on this phase-out period to file an ancillary claim in a pending NAFTA arbitration against Mexico, seeking compensation for Mexico’s unlawful shutdown of Vulcan’s quarry and port in Mexico in May 2022. Any alterations or reconsiderations through binding interpretations of these critical provisions could undermine the positions of U.S. investors involved in pending arbitrations; therefore, USTR must seek comprehensive stakeholder input before proceeding with any joint interpretation. Rather than seek to reach an agreement with trading partners at the very end of the Biden Administration, USTR should make recommendations to the incoming Trump Administration on these issues. The incoming administration can then consult with Congress and stakeholders and determine whether to pursue such interpretations with Mexico and Canada during the upcoming 2026 USMCA review, which is approaching rapidly. 

On the importance of including the new Congress in conversations and pausing negotiations:    
  
It is unacceptable for USTR to attempt to change provisions of both trade agreements through lame-duck revisions or binding interpretations without adequately consulting Congress. The lack of communication and transparency during these last-minute, backdoor efforts and negotiations raises significant doubts about whether the proposals align with congressional intent and our national interest. Additionally, now that the 119th Congress is seated, it is only appropriate for you to consult with the new members, chairs, and ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction before engaging with foreign partners on any potential agreements. 

While robust consultation about priorities for negotiating new or improved comprehensive trade agreements would have been welcome earlier in President Biden’s term, it is too late in the term to conduct meaningful consultation that should be the precondition for any such agreements. We are deeply concerned that proceeding with these contemplated interpretations could unacceptably compromise the integrity of existing agreements, undermine the next administration’s trade agenda, and erode protections for U.S. investors. 

As the 119th Congress begins and our Nation prepares for a new presidential administration, we urge USTR to halt these negotiations immediately and provide timely updates on any relevant developments to Congress.

11:01:17 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:01:17 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congressman John Moolenaar, along with Congressmen Darin LaHood (R-IL) and Jared Golden (D-ME), reintroduced the bipartisan  No Official Giveaways Of Taxpayers’ Income to Oppressive Nations (NO GOTION) Act  in the House of Representatives  .  The bill will also be introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senator Rick Scott (R-FL). The legislation would prohibit companies affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from qualifying for green energy production tax credits implemented by the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act. If signed into law, the bill would prevent any company based in China, Russia, Iran or North Korea, and the subsidiaries of those companies from benefiting from these tax credits. 

“The NO GOTION Act is a commonsense, bipartisan measure that prohibits our adversaries from benefitting from the tax dollars of hardworking American families, and right now there is a loophole that allows IRA tax credits to go to Chinese companies. This legislation closes that loophole and makes sure CCP-affiliated companies will not be able to receive tax credits. The United States is in competition with the CCP and under no circumstance should we be giving taxpayer money to Chinese companies,”  said Moolenaar. 

“The Chinese Communist Party is working to replace the United States every day and as we continue to find ways to better protect U.S. businesses and workers from that effort, the least we can do in the short term is ensure we aren’t allowing CCP-affiliated competitors to benefit from our federal tax incentives,”  said LaHood.  “As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Select Committee China, I will not allow hard-working American taxpayers to fund the CCP’s development of energy and critical technologies that will be used to harm the United States. The NO GOTION Act will ensure that companies with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Russia, Iran, and North Korea cannot, in any way, benefit from the energy incentives in our tax code. I look forward to working alongside President Trump and my colleagues in Congress to promote pro-growth tax policy that supports American businesses, protect our national security, and cement U.S. leadership on the world stage.” 

“America’s push for domestic manufacturing should not be exploited for our adversaries’ gain,”  Golden said.  “These manufacturing credits are designed to strengthen our economy, and closing a loophole that allows them to be used to benefit China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a goal that all of us should be able to share. I’m proud to join a bipartisan coalition to fix this problem and ensure federal dollars aren’t being spent to enrich those who would undermine America.” 

Senator Rick Scott said,  “U.S. adversaries shouldn’t be allowed to benefit off American taxpayer dollars with incentives meant to build American businesses. Americans elected us to represent their best interests, and I’m proud to do that with our NO GOTION Act to crack down on companies owned by our adversaries attempting to take advantage of U.S. tax subsidies.” 

The legislation comes as a response to Gotion, a CCP-affiliated company, claiming it was reviewing and assessing how it can utilize the green energy production tax credits. Gotion is currently planning to build factories in Green Charter Township, and Kankakee, Illinois. In June 2024, investigations led by Moolenaar and the House Select Committee on the CCP uncovered Gotion’s close ties to the CCP, including its reliance on  forced labor  (link is external)  in Xinjiang Province. 

In federal filings Gotion has  admitted  (link is external)  it is “wholly owned and controlled” by its China-based parent company, Gotion High-Tech, and it is  subsidized  (link is external)  by the Chinese government. According to Gotion High-Tech’s by-laws it is required to “carry out Party activities in accordance with the Constitution of the [Chinese Communist Party].” 

The text of the NO GOTION Act can be found  here.  (link is external)  The legislation is cosponsored in the House by Representatives  Jack Bergman (R-MI), Tim Walberg (R-MI), Bill Huizenga (R-MI), John James (R-MI), Tom Barrett (R-MI), Mike Bost (R-IL), Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Ben Cline (R-VA), Mike Kelly (R-PA), David Rouzer (R-NC), David Schweikert (R-AZ), Rick Allen (R-GA), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Jake Ellzey (R-TX), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), Gary Palmer (R-AL), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Greg Murphy (R-NC), and Neal Dunn (R-FL) .

11:01:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer gave a speech at the Detroit Auto Show. In her address, Whitmer made hypocritical remarks on subsidies for Chinese companies in the auto industry. She pointed out that “Chinese electric cars and batteries are gobbling up market share” and said that these companies could “crush the core” of Michigan’s economy. 

“Governor Whitmer has given hundreds of millions of dollars to Chinese auto suppliers in Michigan. If she is ready to show she is serious about stopping the Chinese Communist Party from taking over our auto industry she will end the state subsidies she approved for Chinese auto suppliers and stop their projects from moving forward. She has subsidized the CCP’s efforts to make our automakers more dependent on China. Her concerns about Chinese auto suppliers hurting our economy are empty until she ends her subsidies for them,” said Congressman John Moolenaar. 

In her address on Wednesday, Governor Whitmer stated, “Chinese electric cars and batteries are gobbling up market share. European automakers are falling behind. More than 12 million European direct and indirect auto industry jobs are at risk. If we do not act, that could be our future. One where we allow  companies subsidized by the Chinese government  to sell at a loss and crush the core of our economy." 

Whitmer has approved hundreds of millions of dollars in state subsidies for CATL and Gotion, two companies affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Concerns have been raised about CATL for many years, and the Biden administration recently added the company  to the list of Chinese military companies  (link is external)  . Gotion has  admitted  (link is external)  in federal filings that it is “wholly owned and controlled” by its China-based parent company, Gotion High-Tech, and it is  subsidized  (link is external)  by the Chinese government. The company also has ties to  forced labor  (link is external)  in China. 

Moolenaar called it  a historic mistake  (link is external)  when the Michigan Senate approved funding for Gotion in 2023 at the behest of Whitmer and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation she controls. He has repeatedly called for state officials to end the subsidies it has provided.

11:01:24 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:01:24 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA-04) and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez introduced the  Reliability to Ratepayers Act  to address hiring and retention issues at the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This bill directs the BPA to develop a comprehensive compensation plan for all employees by allowing the administrator to review and update compensation plans without regard to civil service laws. 

“Ensuring reliable and affordable energy for our communities requires a strong and capable workforce at the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA),”  said Rep. Newhouse. 

Newhouse continues,  “This legislation provides BPA with the flexibility to offer competitive compensation, address hiring and retention challenges, and tackle the backlog of critical projects that impact families and businesses across the Pacific Northwest. By updating BPA’s compensation structure to match industry standards, we can ensure the agency is well-positioned to deliver the reliability ratepayers deserve while strengthening our region's energy future." 

Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez said,  “As a small business owner, I know how investing in high-quality work pays off over time. As I go out and speak with skilled workers across our communities, I see a lot of gray hair. When we can address critical workforce shortages in our federal power system, we’re able to address much-needed, overdue projects that can keep rates down for hardworking Southwest Washington families. I’m introducing the Reliability for Ratepayers Act with Congressman Newhouse to recruit and retain folks in essential public energy jobs by honoring their hard work and skill through appropriate compensation.” 

“The mission of the Public Power Council is to preserve and enhance the benefits of the Federal Columbia River Power System marketed by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for both consumer-owned utilities and the communities they serve. In recent years, the ability of BPA to recruit and retain talented employees has become increasingly more difficult given that BPA salaries are not commensurate with similar positions throughout the region,”  said Scott Simms, CEO and Executive Director of the Public Power Council.  “The legislation introduced today by Reps. Gluesenkamp Perez and Newhouse goes a long way toward encouraging a competitive and talented workforce for the betterment of the region. PPC applauds bipartisan work and the continued commitment of ensuring reliable, affordable power for the Northwest.” 

“Providing BPA with the authority to competitively compensate staff is critical to supporting the region's transmission system and creating new economic development opportunities,”  said Nicole Hughes, Executive Director of Renewable Northwest. 

“Providing BPA with the authority to competitively compensate its staff is one of the most important changes Congress can make to improve the power sector in the Northwest and ensure more transmission gets built,”  said Spencer Gray, Executive Director of the Northwest and Intermountain Power Producers Coalition.  “Independent power producers deeply appreciate the bipartisan leadership of Reps. Gluesenkamp Perez, Newhouse, and their colleagues in pursuing this legislation.”

“There is no excuse for a biological man being allowed to compete against a biological woman in athletic competitions. Outside of the disgrace for fairness and danger it poses to sports, accepting this idea fails women and girls who work hard to achieve excellence in their sport. I am proud to support this bill to put an end to this unacceptable concept,”  said Rep. Newhouse. 

This legislation provides women and girls equal opportunity in athletics and a fair playing field by ensuring that females compete against other females in women’s athletic activities. 

The bill requires Title IX to treat sex, for purposes of athletic activities, as “recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth” and bans recipients of federal funding from operating, sponsoring, or facilitating athletic programs that permit a male to participate in a women’s sporting event.

11:01:28 root         DEBUG    Desc: DES MOINES  — U.S. Representative Zach Nunn (IA-03) today announced he will serve as Vice Chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions. U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (OH-08) will chair the subcommittee. 

“Foreign adversaries, like China and Russia, take advantage of every opportunity to jeopardize our national security. As a former cyber intelligence officer, I’ve witnessed firsthand that these attacks don’t happen on a traditional battlefield,”  said Rep. Nunn  . “As the threats against our country evolve, I look forward to working with the Committee to prioritize combatting illicit finance, fostering technological innovation, and ensuring that our security measures stay ahead of emerging threats.” 

Rep. Nunn served our country for two decades in the United States Air Force. As an airborne intelligence officer, Rep. Nunn flew recon missions off the coasts of Russia and China. After 9/11, he deployed three times to the Middle East and flew over 700 combat hours. He served as Director of Cybersecurity at the White House’s National Security Council combating cyber-attacks from foreign adversaries. Rep. Nunn currently serves as a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. 

“As an U.S. Air Force veteran and service on our Committee in Congress, Rep. Nunn is a perfect member to help lead the National Security Subcommittee alongside Rep. Davidson,”  said Chairman Hill, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.  “Rep. Nunn understands the importance of protecting our nation’s national security, whether that is combating illicit finance or maintaining American leadership in the international financial markets. I look forward to watching Rep. Nunn thrive in his new role as Vice Chair of the National Security Subcommittee.” 

In the 118th Congress, Rep. Nunn  passed  bipartisan legislation into law to create transparency in the enforcement of current sanctions on the Iranian regime, allow for essential and targeted legislation when responding to Iranian aggression, and provide accountability for government management of sanctions. 

“As a veteran of the United States Air Force, still serving as Colonel in the Air Force Reserve, Rep. Nunn has devoted himself to securing America’s foreign and domestic national security interests,”  said Chairman Davidson.  “I am excited to have Rep. Nunn serve as my Vice Chairman, and I look forward to working closely together to strengthen our financial intelligence and national security protocols in the 119th Congress.” 

Building on his legislative efforts last Congress, Rep. Nunn will use his new leadership position to: 

  * Hold our adversaries accountable, including the Iranian “ghost fleet” and Russian oligarchs 
  * Modernize the Defense Production Act (DPA) as an arsenal for democracy 
  * Leverage technology to defeat foreign adversaries 
  * Counter China’s aggression with every possible tool 
  * Combat the financing of international terrorism 
  * Fight financial fraud that hurts Americans and funds our enemies 



In addition to serving as Vice Chair for the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions, Rep. Nunn will also serve on the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Capital Markets.

11:01:34 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:01:34 root         DEBUG    Desc: Union Beach, NJ – Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06) today announced a major win for New Jersey residents impacted by Superstorm Sandy during an event with survivors and advocates at Union Beach Borough Hall. After years of determined advocacy, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved Pallone’s request to waive disaster aid clawbacks for low- and moderate-income Sandy survivors, as well as individuals facing foreclosure or who lost loved ones. 

This federal waiver eliminates the unjust requirement to repay disaster assistance—a policy that has placed undue hardship on those still grappling with the storm’s aftermath. The relief is expected to be worth millions of dollars impacting hundreds of households. 

“Superstorm Sandy devastated our state, and for far too long, disaster aid clawbacks added unnecessary hardship for people still trying to recover,”  said Pallone.  “Every time I spoke with survivors, I heard stories of fear and uncertainty about how they would pay back money they used to rebuild their homes and lives. This relief is about justice for those who have endured so much—people who lost everything through no fault of their own—and ensuring they can finally move forward without this unfair financial burden. It’s a step toward helping our state heal, and I’m grateful to HUD for working with us to make this happen.” 

The waiver provides targeted relief to eligible low- and moderate-income households, allowing forgiveness of up to $27,000 in disaster assistance debt. It also benefits those who experienced foreclosure, bankruptcy, or the loss of a loved one after receiving federal disaster aid. The State of New Jersey will now determine eligibility among approximately 900 households who have been asked to return more than $30 million in federal disaster assistance. 

Joe Mangino, Board President of the New Jersey Organizing Project, joined Pallone at today’s event, saying, “This is major progress for us and low- and moderate-income Sandy families who will see forgiveness, survivors who have had to file for bankruptcy or are in foreclosure, and those heartbreaking cases where Sandy survivors have passed away. These are the folks who need the life jacket the most. It will mean everything. We are so grateful to Congressman Pallone for spearheading this major step forward and for fighting for clawback forgiveness alongside Sandy survivors for years. We know he'll continue to stand with us and work toward relief for all of us." 

Pallone’s sustained engagement with HUD, including direct discussions with Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman, was instrumental in securing the waiver. In 2022, he successfully advocated for an indefinite pause on federal recoupment deadlines, laying the groundwork for this breakthrough. 

This announcement underscores Pallone’s long-standing commitment to disaster recovery and his dedication to ensuring New Jersey residents receive fair and comprehensive support as they continue to rebuild their lives.

11:01:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:01:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06), a longtime advocate for Sandy survivors, announced today that  the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has agreed to waive the recoupment of federal disaster assistance for eligible survivors.  Pallone has fought tirelessly to ensure Sandy-impacted families are not burdened with repaying federal disaster aid. HUD agreed to Pallone’s request to provide relief to low- and moderate-income survivors, as well as those who have faced foreclosure or lost loved ones. 

These recoupment efforts known as clawbacks have blindsided homeowners because many New Jersey residents owe tens of thousands of dollars through no fault of their own after applying for loans and benefits offered by various federal programs at the recommendation of the government. Hundreds of New Jersey households are expected to benefit from this recoupment waiver. Pallone spoke to Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman by phone in November and December to urge her to approve the proposal, which will provide up to $27,000 in relief to low- and moderate-income households. The move will also provide relief to homeowners who received disaster assistance that then faced foreclosure, bankruptcy or died after receiving aid. There are more than 900 New Jersey households that owe over $31 million in clawbacks. The State of New Jersey will now work to determine eligibility. 

“New Jersey families were decimated by Superstorm Sandy and have been on the hook for millions of dollars in federal clawbacks through no fault of their own. It’s ridiculous that the government would try to take back disaster aid from people who have died, had their property foreclosed on, or are just scraping by after getting wiped out by Sandy. After years of effort, the federal government is finally giving New Jersey families the relief they deserve,”  said Congressman Pallone.  “I’m thankful to Acting Secretary Todman for taking this crucial step that will finally deliver relief to Sandy survivors who have been plagued by federal clawback efforts for years.” 

“This is major progress for us and low- and moderate-income Sandy families who will see forgiveness, survivors who have had to file for bankruptcy or are in foreclosure, and those heartbreaking cases where Sandy survivors have passed away. These are the folks who need the life jacket the most. It will mean everything,”  said Joe Mangino, Board President of the New Jersey Organizing Project.  “We are so grateful to Congressman Pallone for spearheading this major step forward and for fighting for clawback forgiveness alongside Sandy survivors for years. We know he'll continue to stand with us and work toward relief for all of us." 

On December 11, Pallone joined disaster survivors at the U.S. Capitol, including advocates from the New Jersey Organizing Project, to push for comprehensive and equitable disaster recovery solutions. 

In 2022, Pallone secured an indefinite legislative extension of recoupment efforts for debt owed to the federal government that was included in the Omnibus Fiscal Year 2023 package but did not absolve homeowners of the funds owed.

11:01:36 root         DEBUG    Titles: Pallone Secures $10 Million for Port Monmouth Beach Renourishment from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
11:01:36 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:01:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: Port Monmouth, NJ –  Congressman Frank Pallone (NJ-06) today announced $10 million in funding from the landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support critical beach renourishment efforts in Port Monmouth. This federal investment builds on Pallone’s leadership in drafting and passing the historic infrastructure law, which has delivered vital resources to strengthen infrastructure and bolster resilience across New Jersey and the nation. 

The $10 million will address significant erosion that has occurred over the past decade, reinforcing dunes and fortifying the town’s defenses against future storms. Combined with the community’s comprehensive flood control infrastructure—including flood walls, levees, pumps, and flood gates—the beach renourishment project will create a robust line of protection for Port Monmouth residents. This marks another milestone in the community’s recovery from Superstorm Sandy 12 years ago, as the final contract for the large-scale flood control project initiated after the storm is set to be completed. 

“Port Monmouth has come a long way since the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, but our work is far from over,”  said Pallone.  “The $10 million investment I’ve secured through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will strengthen our shorelines and protect homes, businesses, and the local economy. This law, which I was proud to help author and pass, is a testament to what we can achieve with federal investments that deliver real benefits for families here in New Jersey. We’re building resilience and ensuring the vibrancy of Port Monmouth for generations to come.” 

“Port Monmouth’s resilience and recovery since Superstorm Sandy is a testament to the strength and determination of our community,” said Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown. “This $10 million investment secured by Congressman Pallone will play a critical role in fortifying our coastline, protecting homes and businesses, and ensuring the safety of our residents.” 

"As a longtime resident of Port Monmouth, I am thrilled that Congressman Pallone was able to secure these crucial funds for beach replenishment to help safe guard our residents from future storms and rising sea levels", said Cathy Rogers, resident of Port Monmouth and longtime advocate for storm protection. We called on the Congressman to help protect the residents here and he delivered. We are thankful for his leadership.“ 

Port Monmouth, part of Middletown Township, was among the hardest-hit communities during Superstorm Sandy. Since then, Pallone has championed federal support for coastal resilience, ensuring New Jersey communities have the resources needed to recover and prepare for future climate impacts. The flood control project, funded through Sandy Disaster Relief allocations also secured by Pallone, has been central to these efforts. However, ongoing exposure and erosion have made this beach renourishment project a critical next step. 

As the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Pallone played a pivotal role in shaping and advancing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is one of the most significant infrastructure investments in U.S. history. The law has provided billions of dollars for infrastructure upgrades, climate resilience, and community safety across the country. Today’s announcement underscores Pallone’s commitment to leveraging federal resources to protect and enhance New Jersey’s coastal communities.

11:01:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.—Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06) today issued the following statement on the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel: 

“For 15 agonizing months, families of hostages like Edan Alexander from Tenafly, NJ, have endured unimaginable pain. Today’s agreement offers a glimmer of hope with the release of 33 hostages, including women, children, and the elderly—a critical step forward. Yet, we must not lose sight of Hamas’ ongoing atrocities, including the use of human shields and oppression of innocent civilians in Gaza. 

“The October 7 attacks reminded the world of Israel’s existential threats and Hamas’ heinous tactics. This agreement, with its temporary ceasefire and phased release of hostages, underscores Israel’s commitment to safeguarding its citizens while prioritizing the safe return of every hostage. 

“True peace requires disarming Hamas and ensuring safety for all innocent lives. The release of Palestinian prisoners, some linked to Israeli deaths, highlights the painful complexities of these negotiations. My thoughts are with those still waiting for news. America must remain steadfast in supporting Israel.”

11:01:38 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06) celebrated the signing of a strategic partnership agreement planned for later today between the United States and the Republic of Armenia. As Co-Chair and founder of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, Pallone will meet with an Armenian government delegation this afternoon after the historic signing ceremony. This agreement is the product of months of discussions kicked off by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James O’Brien’s visit to Yerevan, Armenia, in June. During that visit, O’Brien announced the U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue Capstone meeting to review the significant progress made in deepening bilateral relations and discuss next steps. The strategic partnership agreement is the next step in the process to bring closer cooperation and collaboration between the countries in economic and energy sectors, security and law enforcement, and democratic and justice reforms. 

“This agreement highlights the remarkable progress in the U.S.-Armenia relationship, a cause I have passionately championed in my role as Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues,”  said Pallone.  “It demonstrates the growth and important reforms the Armenian government has made since the Velvet Revolution in 2018 and shows the promise the nation has as a reliable American partner in the South Caucasus. Most importantly, a strategic partnership means closer bilateral ties between our countries, further American investments in the future of Armenia, and an overall stronger link between our people. I’m pleased the Biden Administration has made this partnership official, and I look forward to working closely with the State Department and the Armenian government to continue this positive momentum.”

11:01:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: The New Hampshire delegation is welcoming $14,110,558 in federal grants for New Hampshire organizations that provide housing assistance and supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. This funding comes through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) Program and the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program (YHDP), which work with nonprofits, states and local governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals, families and youth, as well as individuals fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. 

“Far too many Granite Staters continue to experience homelessness or a lack of safe shelter. Our state and local governments, nonprofits, and community partners are on the frontlines of this crisis, and this federal funding will provide them with resources to support families and individuals experiencing homelessness,”  said Congressman Pappas.  “Housing is fundamental to one’s health and wellbeing, and more work must be done to grow our housing supply, expand mental health resources, and help people find safe and affordable housing.” 

“Every Granite Stater deserves a roof over their head, and that requires federal funding working hand in hand with communities to get resources where they’re needed most,”  said Senator Shaheen.  “I'm glad to see federal funding coming to organizations in our state that work to house Granite Staters and provide critical supportive services.” 

“Granite Staters who are homeless – including those fleeing heartbreaking circumstances like domestic violence – should know that there are resources to help,”  said Senator Hassan.  “I am pleased to see more than $14 million in federal funding heading to New Hampshire to provide safe temporary and permanent housing for Granite Staters in need, and help people build more stable futures.” 

“Having a home is a cornerstone of the American Dream but across New Hampshire, lack of access to safe, reliable housing has put that dream out of reach for far too many Granite Staters,”  said Representative Goodlander.  “I’m proud to help announce these federal resources heading to our state to address our housing crisis and support the important work of extraordinary organizations across New Hampshire.” 

The New Hampshire Congressional delegation is committed to ensuring Granite State communities have the resources needed to tackle the housing affordability crisis. Last year, Senators Shaheen and Hassan and Representative Pappas  celebrated more than $30 million in federal grants  (link is external)  for New Hampshire to build more affordable housing across the Granite State.

11:01:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata  is an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Representative Ed Case (HI-01) to end what he called “the 

discriminatory and exclusionary shipping practices faced by residents and businesses in Hawai‘i, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and other U.S. territories.” U.S. Representative James Moylan (R-Guam) is the co-lead on the measure, with original co-sponsors U.S. Representatives Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R-American Samoa), Pablo José Hernández Rivera (D-Puerto Rico), and Kimberlyn King-Hinds (R-Northern Mariana Islands).

“The people of our islands depend heavily on shipping for many goods, from basic necessities to construction materials, so cost increases in shipping can severely impact family budgets,” said  Congresswoman Aumua Amata Radewagen  . “Thank you to Congressman Case, and I’m happy to cosponsor and support this bipartisan effort that protects the economies that rely on shipping the most.” 

Case said H.R. 380, the Affordable Shipping for All Act, “will ensure that no shipping company, including the United States Postal Service, can impose discriminatory rates or exclude non-contiguous areas from receiving shipments. It will also require that shipping rates for non-contiguous areas reflect the actual cost of service, rather than arbitrary price increases.” 

Case continued: “This blatant discrimination and exclusion is illustrated by Hawai‘i, my home state. We are over 2,500 miles from the West Coast and depend on shipping to bring in more than 90% of the products we need. Like our other non-contiguous family, we do not have the same manufacture, transport and delivery options as does the contiguous continental U.S.” 

“I’d like to thank Rep. Case for his leadership in the matter of fair shipping practice, and I’m honored to co-lead the Affordable Shipping for All Act with him,” said Rep. Moylan. “Guam and Hawaii naturally share many similarities, but all non-contiguous areas are at a severe disadvantage in domestic shipping. I fully support this bill as it represents a step in the right direction in solving maritime disparities in the U.S.” 

“We introduced legislation so that USPS and companies like Amazon, which sell products online, don’t charge more for shipping to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and other jurisdictions outside the 48 contiguous states,” said Rep. Hernández Rivera. 

“One of the most significant challenges shared by those living outside the Lower 48 is the unaffordable cost of goods and materials,” said Rep. King[1]Hinds. “In the Northern Marianas, the people I represent work hard to live lives comparable to their fellow Americans in the states, but the reality is that the very basic necessities of food, consumer goods, and essential materials are far more expensive. A dollar simply doesn’t stretch as far in non-contiguous areas as it does in the mainland. I want to thank Congressman Case for shining a spotlight on this disparity in Congress, and I am proud to join him in advocating for solutions to lower costs for Americans outside the Lower 48, including those in the Northern Marianas.” 

Case said rather than treating us equally, residents and businesses of the non-contiguous U.S. face four persistent and unfair shipping practices that drive up costs and make life harder for millions of Americans:“First, as confirmed by the Federal Trade Commission, many online retailers outright refuse to ship basic products our parts of the United States, effectively treating our areas as if we are foreign countries. This exclusion prevents millions of Americans from even accessing essential goods. 

“Second, even when retailers do offer shipping to the non-contiguous areas, they frequently deny customers free shipping options, even though such options are readily available for customers in the contiguous U.S. This is true even when the actual cost of shipping from the continental U.S. to a non-contiguous area is higher than to another location in the continental U.S. This leaves residents in these areas at a distinct disadvantage when trying to purchase products online. 

“Third, when private shipping services are made available, the prices are often inflated and bear no reasonable relation to the actual distance. For example, the cost to ship a 2-pound package from Los Angeles to Hawai‘i can exceed $45, while the same package from Los Angeles to New York City, the same distance, costs only $14. This price disparity is both unreasonable and unjust. 

“Fourth, the United States Postal Service (USPS) also treats the noncontiguous areas unfairly. It recently created a new Zone 10 for shipments to Hawai‘i, Alaska and other non-contiguous areas, which will increase shipping rates for Priority Mail Express, Priority Mail and USPS Ground Advantage packages to and from those locations by 5%. The introduction of Zone 10 fundamentally discriminates against the non-contiguous parts of our country, which runs directly counter to the foundational USPS charge to provide equal access to the U.S. mail.”

“This important credit has bolstered American Samoa in the past and will strengthen our largest local industry, while bringing stability to the many small businesses that rely on the presence of the cannery, as well as be available to future employers for confidence about investing in American Samoa,” said Congresswoman Aumua Amata. “I will continue working to renew this policy, and the start of a new year and a new Congress is the right time to introduce this effort.” 

The American Samoa Economic Development Credit was initiated in 2006, following the phase out of prior tax policies, and helps American Samoa’s largest private employer continue to do business in the Territory and make plans for the future. 

“The Star-Kist tuna from American Samoa is a U.S. product from the catch to the canning, and as an affordable source of quality protein, it is an important link in American food security, which is part of national security. This ‘Buy American’ product is perfect for school nutrition, purchases by our military and more,” concluded Congresswoman Amata. “Through 30A renewal, U.S. policy can recognize the challenges of a small island economy with a single primary industry, while supporting the future of U.S. food security.”

HVAC has oversight of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and jurisdiction over legislation concerning Veterans. 

Within the Committee’s activities, Congresswoman Amata will serve on two key Subcommittees: the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is the congressional starting point for all oversight of the VA, and the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs (DAMA) focuses on much-need Veterans’ services, such as the provision of disability assistance, headstones, funeral honors, and national cemeteries. 

The full Committee is led by Chairman Mike Bost of Illinois, a Veteran who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and is a lifelong public servant, to include service as a firefighter, in the Illinois legislature, then Congress, where he leads HVAC and sets the Committee’s overall agenda for the next two years.

I grew up in a military family, as my father served in World War II, and I had brothers who served, and a grandfather who served. I am committed to our Veterans and continuing to listen to their needs. I appreciate my colleagues for a bipartisan desire to see real improvements made in VA services to them.” 

“Among the host of issues, the Committee will continue to emphasize reforms to reduce backlogs and modernize records, efforts to improve mental health services, prevent tragic Veterans’ suicides, strengthen services across the board, and better attract and retain skilled professional employees to the VA.” 

Congresswoman Amata has already announced her continued service in the House Natural Resources Committee as well, including a new leadership role as Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs, with jurisdiction over legislation related to the Insular Areas. The details of her third committee are expected in the week ahead.

The amendments are already approved by the people of American Samoa, and Amata’s recent legislation, H.R. 6062, signed into law by President Biden on January 4  th  , provided for the completion of these amendments to become officially part of American Samoa’s Constitution, and streamlines any future amendments following approval by the people through a vote. 

“I so appreciate Secretary Haaland’s invitation and especially her prompt signature to complete our people’s amendments. I know from working with her both in Congress and DOI that indigenous self-determination issues are close to her heart,” said  Congresswoman Aumua Amata.  “American Samoa can now implement the constitutional amendments that our people voted for, and that’s a great start to 2025.”

At the signing,  Secretary Haaland  read from the document’s purpose, then said, “This is such a wonderful example of, not only bipartisanship, and being a Member of Congress at one time I know how important that is, but also a fervent desire to improve the lives of Americans everywhere, so we’re very proud to have the opportunity to sign this today, and Congresswoman I’m really honored that you’re here.” 

Final passage of Amata’s bill by the U.S. Senate was in December, in the last group of bills finished the 118th Congress, after several months of work. The House had already passed the bill in July. At each step, the bill passed by unanimous consent. Amata’s legislation fulfilled the unanimous request of American Samoa’s elected leaders expressed by Fono resolution to remove unnecessary steps in Washington, D.C. Under the law, the Interior Secretary can approve American Samoa’s constitutional amendments that have been approved by the people without extra hurdles and delays that other territories do not have.

“His message of equality for all is now a flourishing ideal that the American people seek to uphold, to the lasting benefit of people of any heritage and the ongoing strengthening of the country. 

“In Washington, D.C., his Memorial on our National Mall includes some of his many powerful quotations from his famous speeches, sermons, and letters. One of his briefest quotations is a personal favorite of mine, that he said in several major public speeches: ‘The time is always right to do what is right.’ 

“Martin Luther King, Jr., was a dedicated preacher as well as our most prominent civil rights leader. We honor his commitment to achieving change through peaceful efforts and persuasion, and as a result, his message is timeless.”

11:01:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  — Today,  Congresswoman Delia C. Ramirez  (IL-03), the Vice Ranking Member of the 118th Homeland Security Committee, released the following statement: 

“This week, millions found hope in the promise of a ceasefire agreement. Since I co-introduced the resolution calling for a ceasefire, I have longed for the end to the bombings in Gaza, the safe return for hostages and prisoners, the consistent delivery of humanitarian aid, and a pathway to safety and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. While I am relieved the agreement has been ratified, I mourn the lives lost, grieve with families, and lament the destruction we have witnessed the last 1 year, 3 months and 9 days.    
  
Our commitment to peace and safety can't end with the announcement of a ceasefire agreement. We must recognize the preciousness of peace and continue to demand that the deal holds and is honored - from Netanyahu to Hamas to the incoming Trump administration. It is fitting that we be reminded today that true peace isn’t just the absence of violence, but the presence of justice. We must continue to address the systemic causes of violence, instability, and uncertainty in the region. We must affirm Israelis and Palestinians a self-determined future, free of systems of occupation, apartheid, and extremism. 

To all the advocates, pursuers of peace, diplomats, and courageous dissenting voices from Congress to the Department of State to college campuses: thank you for leading us in this fight for peace, freedom, safety, and dignity for all. The world we envision is possible.”

11:01:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  — Today,  Congresswoman Delia C. Ramirez  (IL-03) announced she will serve as Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee during the 119th Congress. Congresswoman Ramirez returns to the committee after successfully introducing and passing legislation to restore education benefits for defrauded veterans during the last Congress.

“The Trump Administration and DOGE’s mission to paint vital VA services as a money drain is not a coincidence. Theirs is a laser-focused effort to privatize and dismantle the best blueprint we have to implement people-centered policies popular among working Americans – from health care to housing to education. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I am ready to fight against their efforts to dismantle the organized labor force, divert money to the pockets of Trump’s billionaire friends, and convince us that healthcare and housing for ALL are impossibilities,"  said Congresswoman Ramirez.  ”Whether it is funding to house our veterans in Puerto Rico, defending education benefits, or ensuring health care for veterans in my district, I am ready for round 2 in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and honored to continue the work we started last Congress. I want to thank Ranking Member Takano and my colleagues for their leadership and for entrusting me with this new role. I look forward to our work to center an agenda for our veterans that honors their service with action and treats them with dignity.”

"I'm pleased to welcome Representative Ramirez back to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for the 119th Congress and congratulate her on being elected Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. We have significant work ahead of us to hold the Trump Administration accountable and ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs is working in the best interests of veterans. Rep. Ramirez is well-suited to undertake this important work, and I look forward to continuing to work with her to make sure all veterans can receive the care and benefits they have earned,"  said Ranking Member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee Mark Takano. 

“Rep. Delia Ramirez will be an outstanding Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation in the 119th Congress, and her appointment is a testament to her exceptional capabilities and dynamic leadership. Collaborating closely with Ranking Member Mark Takano and the entire Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Rep. Ramirez will address critical challenges and advance meaningful initiatives for the American people. I look forward to witnessing all she will achieve in this role,” said  Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse. 

“On behalf of Cook County’s veteran community, I want to congratulate Congresswoman Delia Ramirez on her selection as Ranking Member of the HVAC Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,”  said Veterans Assistance Commission of Cook County Superintendent Elizabeth D. Soto.  “I’m confident that in this role, the Congresswoman will continue her deep commitment to serving veterans and defending their public benefits. As threats of cuts and privatization to veteran services are in the federal conversation, the Veterans Assistance Commission of Cook County and I look forward to continuing to partner with Ramirez in our efforts to improve and protect the services we have earned.”

11:01:53 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:01:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  — Today,  Congresswoman Delia C. Ramirez (IL-03), U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL),  and  U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)  announced $13,100,000 in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Railroad Crossing Elimination (RCE) Grant Program funding for grade crossing improvements on Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) infrastructure in the Village of Elmwood Park, Illinois. The Grand Avenue Proposed Grade Separation project would reduce traffic, improve Metra reliability, and ensure commuters’ safety by eliminating a dangerous crossing where 160 crashes occurred between 2018 and 2022. 

“The benefits of investing in public infrastructure go beyond economic development, creation of good-paying jobs, and opportunities. We achieve cleaner environments, better family health outcomes, and safer commutes,”  said Congresswoman Ramirez  .“I’m proud that through an intergovernmental approach with Mayor Saviano, Village Manager Volpe, and our senators, Durbin and Duckworth, we have secured $13.1 million for a transformative project for the residents of Elmwood Park and Cook County at large. I look forward to continuing delivering the funding needed to improve safety, reliability, and efficiency in IL-03.” 

“Today’s funding is a major investment in Illinois’ future. Our state’s communities will be safer and better connected because of these infrastructure projects that support Illinois’ rail industry, roads, and pedestrian paths,”  said US Senator Dick Durbin  . “Senator Duckworth and I will continue working with our Congressional colleagues to ensure our state has the federal resources to improve and expand Illinois’ infrastructure.” 

“Investing in our rail infrastructure is about growing our economy and helping make it safer and more efficient for folks to get around,”  US Senator Tammy Duckworth said.  “This significant federal investment will help us modernize our rail system in Elmwood Park so all Illinoisans can access the commuter rail they need to go to work, go home and everywhere in between. I’ll keep working with Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Ramirez to help ensure our communities receive the much-needed federal resources they deserve.” 

“The awarding of this $13.1 million grant by the federal government for the Grand Avenue underpass is great news for our community,”  said Elmwood Park Mayor Angelo “Skip” Saviano  . “We are deeply grateful not only to the Federal Railroad Administration but especially to Congresswoman Ramirez and the entire Illinois Congressional delegation for their unwavering support for this project. Today, we take a significant step toward making this quality of life enhancement a reality. Improved safety, less traffic congestion, and new opportunities for economic development are just some of the benefits that await us once the Grand Avenue underpass comes to fruition.” 

“The Grand Avenue underpass project is more than just an Elmwood Park project. The benefits of this grade separation will flow to our entire region,”  said Elmwood Park Village Manager Paul Volpe  . “And it is only happening because of the strong support and teamwork we have from our partners in Washington, the State of Illinois, and Cook County. I also extend special thanks to the ICC and Metra for their support and cooperation.” 

The Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois Commerce Commission, and Cook County Department of Transportation and Highways will provide the required 20% non-federal funding match. 

“The Grand Avenue underpass project will be built by the hands of workers from our communities. I am thankful for Congresswoman Ramirez, Mayor Saviano, and the Illinois Congressional Delegation for their unwavering commitment to deliver this funding to create good-paying union jobs in Elmwood Park,”  said IUOE Operating Engineers Local 150 President-Business Manager James M Sweeney.  “The men and women of 

IUOE Operating Engineers Local 150 are ready to continue our work together for the safety, security, and economic development of the region.” 

Metra CEO/Executive Director Jim Derwinski said  , "This investment from the Federal Railroad Administration will help deliver safer rail infrastructure to the Village of Elmwood Park, and travelers through the region. The Village's leadership has been diligent in securing support from the Congressional delegation, as well as coordinating with local stakeholders. Metra has already proudly committed $10 million toward this project, and we look forward to seeing this safety upgrade completed." 

“We’re proud to once again work with our federal and local partners to modernize infrastructure in an important part of Illinois,”  said Jason Osborn, Director of IDOT’s Office of Intermodal Project Implementation  . “Projects like these not only make the movement of people and freight over rails more efficient and reliable, but improve safety and quality of life for residents who walk, bike and roll.” 

BACKGROUND: 

Congresswoman Ramirez has ensured the delivery of needed funding back to IL-03 to improve transportation infrastructure. In FY24: 

  * Ramirez secured $8 million in federal funds from the Department of Transportation’s Rail Crossing Elimination program to support the separation of Metra train traffic from pedestrians and cars in the Franklin Park community– a project that will improve safety and mobility for residents. 
  * Ramirez secured $840,000 in Community Project Funding for the Pace Suburban Bus Division of the Regional Transit Authority to implement transit signal improvements on Harlem Avenue between Irving Park Road and North Avenue, a corridor with one of the heaviest bus ridership rates in Cook County, Illinois. These transit signal improvements help facilitate shorter travel times for bus riders. 
  * Ramirez successfully advocated for $809,000 from the US Department of Transportation for the Village of Bensenville to conduct a demonstration activity pilot program to explore technology solutions centered around motor vehicle safety and emergency response times for at-grade rail crossings.

Press Release 

WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21) announced the reintroduction of legislation to block taxpayer dollars from funding the United Nations’ so-called “Human Rights Council.” 

“The U.N.'s "Human Rights" Council is a long-running joke. This body has the audacity to lecture the world about human rights while giving seats to some of the worst abusers in the world — like China, Cuba and Sudan,”  said Representative Roy  . “  Further, it disproportionately attacks our ally Israel as part of the U.N.'s overall leftist crusade against Western Civilization, while letting monstrous and authoritarian regimes like Iran get away with little more than a slap on the wrist by comparison — if that.” 

Members of the UNHRC include countries with abhorrent human rights records such as China and Cuba. While UNHRC regularly ignores atrocities committed by many of these nations, it consistently and disproportionately targets the State of Israel. 

For example, from 2006-2024 the council adopted only four resolutions on Venezuela, 14 on Eritrea, 15 on Iran, 17 on North Korea, and 45 on Syria, but issued 108 condemning Israel. 

During the same period, there were zero resolutions targeting countries like China and Cuba — countries that repeatedly violate the rights of women, religious and ethnic minorities, journalists, and political dissidents. 

“This globalist, anti-western propaganda machine doesn't deserve a dime of our money or an ounce of our credibility,”  continued Representative Roy  . 

Cosponsors of the bill include Reps. Andy Ogles (TN-5), David Rouzer (NC-7), Ben Cline (VA-6), Diana Harshberger (TN-1), Andy Biggs (AZ-5), Riley Moore (WV-2). 

Text of the bill is available  here  .

WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21) announced the reintroduction of the “No Taxpayer Funding for the World Health Organization Act,” legislation prohibiting U.S. funding to the World Health Organization. 

“The World Health Organization (WHO) doesn't serve our interests and doesn't deserve our money. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic this body ran interference for the Chinese Communist Party — arguably helping that regime make the entire outbreak worse.”  Rep. Roy said,  “Taking money from hardworking families struggling with the aftermath of Biden's inflation crisis to send it to a bunch of leftist "health experts" and bureaucrats in Geneva is unacceptable. I have full confidence that President Trump will cut the WHO's funding off — as he did last time — but this legislation will ensure that no future administration can restart it. Let's get this done.” 

Time and time again, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proven to be a puppet of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO parroted false claims made by the CCP such as that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,” praised the CCP for its “transparency” while covering up evidence to the contrary, and ignored the silencing of Dr. Li Wenliang—an early whistleblower in China—all the while leveraging its influence in WHO against Taiwan. And nothing has changed. Today, WHO is still refusing to seriously consider the possibility that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab and will not apologize for perpetuating fake and destructive practices of social distancing and masking. 

This bill is cosponsored by Reps. Clay Higgins (LA-3), Andy Biggs (AZ-5), Claudia Tenney (NY-24), Andy Ogles (TN-5), Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14), John Moolenaar (MI-2), Ralph Norman (SC-5), Eric Burlison (MO-7), Diana Harshbarger (TN-1), Pat Fallon (TX-4), Barry Moore (AL-1), Anna Paulina Luna (FL-13), and Harriet Hageman (WY-AL).

Press Release 

WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21) and Rep. Seth Magaziner (RI-1) announced the bipartisan reintroduction of the TRUST in Congress Act to ban Members of Congress and their families from engaging in insider trading. 

“The American people should have faith that Congress is at work for the good of the country, not for their own bank accounts. For years I have been working to address the problem of stock trading in Congress, first introducing the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act with Rep. Abigail Spanberger back in 2020,”  said Representative Roy.  “Now that Abigail has retired, I am proud to reintroduce this critical and bipartisan legislation alongside my friend Rep. Magaziner (D-RI). We have a long road ahead to address this Congress, but we can and should fix the problem during this term. We have the will and the mandate of the American people to do this. Let's deliver.” 

The Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act would require Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependents to place certain investment assets into a qualified blind trust while serving in office. That way, Representatives and Senators cannot leverage their power as public servants to line their pockets. 

“Trust in Congress is at an all time low, but we can strengthen the integrity of our government by ensuring Members of Congress are serving their constituents and not their stock portfolios,”  said Rep. Seth Magaziner.  “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan, commonsense bill with Representative Chip Roy to ban Members of Congress — and their families — from trading individual stocks, so that we can hold Washington accountable to the people it serves.” 

The bipartisan  TRUST in Congress Act  has been endorsed by many key advocacy and government accountability organizations, including the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen, Protect Democracy, Government Accountability Project, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, Issue One, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and Americans for Prosperity. 

Specifically, the TRUST in Congress Act would: 

  * Require all Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, to put certain investment assets into a qualified blind trust within 180 days after the enactment of this legislation. New Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, would be required to place covered investments into a qualified blind trust within 90 days of assuming office. Affected individuals can remove assets from the blind trust 180 days after the Member leaves Congress. 
  * Require all Members to either 1) certify to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate that they have established a blind trust to include covered investments or 2) certify to the Clerk or the Secretary that they do not own any covered investments. The status of these certifications would be made publicly available by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. 
  * Define covered investments as the following: a security, commodity, future, or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means such as the use of a derivative. 
  * Clarify that the following do not qualify as covered investments for the purpose of this bill: a widely held investment fund (such as a mutual fund) or a U.S. Treasury bill, note, or bond. These investments would not have to be placed in a blind trust. 



This bipartisan bill was co-led by Rep. Seth Magaziner (RI-2), and cosponsored by Reps. Alma Adams (NC-12), Don Beyer (VA-8), Greg Casar (TX-35), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-6), Emanuel Cleaver (MO-5). Angie Craig (MN-2), Elijah Crane (AZ-2), Jason Crow (CO-6), Sharice Davids (KS-3), Suzan DelBene (WA-1), Christopher Deluzio (PA-17), Robert Garcia (CA-42), Jared Golden (ME-2), Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-6), Jared Huffman (CA-2), Dusty Johnson (SD-AL), William Keating (MA-9), Young Kim (CA-40), Greg Landsman (OH-1), Michael Lawler (NY-17), Teresa Fernandez (NM-3), Mike Levin (CA-49), Nancy Mace (SC-1), Betty McCollum (MN-4), Frank Mrvan (IN-1), Gregory Murphy (NC-3), Jerrod Nadler (NY-12), Joe Neguse (CO-2), Eleanor Norton (DC-AL), Marie Glusenkamp Perez (WA-3), Scott Perry (PA-10), Brittany Pettersen (CO-7), Mark Pocan (WI-2), Andrea Salinas (OR-6), Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Eric Sorensen (IL-17), Greg Stanton (AZ-4), Hayley Stevens (MI-11), Dina Titus (NV-11), Paul Tonko (NY-20), Gabe Vasquez (NM-2), and Nikema Williams (GA-5).

11:02:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON - Today, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) issued the following statement on the ceasefire-hostage deal reached between Israel and Hamas: 

“I am relieved by President Joe Biden’s announcement that a ceasefire and hostage agreement in the Israel-Hamas war has been reached. This is a critical step towards permanently ending the catastrophic war in Gaza. The U.S. and our allies must continue their aggressive diplomacy to bring lasting peace in the region. 

“For 15 and a half months, hostage families have been living an agonizing nightmare of not knowing whether their loved ones are still alive and whether they will ever return home. Innocent families in Gaza have endured incomprehensible pain and loss. And both Israelis and Palestinians will be reeling from the trauma and carnage of this war for decades to come. 

“Today’s agreement is long overdue, and we must do everything in our power to ensure it is upheld and that the horrors of the past 467 days are never repeated. Going forward, every single hostage, living and deceased, must be released. All IDF troops must be pulled out of Gaza. The U.S. must work with our allies to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza, ensure that a viable post-war plan is in place, and that rebuilding can begin. And the work must continue towards securing a long-term peace plan that resolves the underlying conflict between Israelis and Palestinians; one that guarantees Israel’s safety and security and self-determination for the Palestinians.”

11:02:05 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON - Today, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, a Chief Deputy Whip, released the following statement after being named the Ranking Member on the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee: 

“It is an honor and a privilege to be able to continue to serve as the top Democrat on the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee, formerly known as the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, for the 119  th  Congress. This Subcommittee has a long and consistent history of bipartisanship and effectiveness and is tasked with protecting American consumers, holding companies accountable, and empowering our federal agencies to better serve our constituents. My political career began as a consumer advocate when I led the successful campaign in 1969 to put freshness dates on products sold in the supermarket. This type of consumer-centered advocacy has guided me throughout my time in Congress. 

“For years now, I have worked closely with my friend, Republican Chair Gus Bilirakis (FL-12), to pass legislation that empowers consumers and keeps Americans safe. Together, we have worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the INFORM Consumers Act, which has helped curb the onslaught of dangerous, counterfeit, and stolen products available to Americans shopping on online marketplaces, and the STURDY Act, which is keeping dangerous furniture products that can injure and kill children off the market and out of our homes. 

“Last Congress, Chair Bilirakis and I nearly got our bipartisan TICKET Act signed into law which would have restored fairness and transparency to the ticketing marketplace. This Congress, we are looking forward to getting this bill over the finish line. Further, I would still like to see a bipartisan bill that would protect consumers’ online data privacy and ensure America’s global competitiveness. There is a lot of work to do to protect consumers from dangerous businesses and products, and I am ready to get back to work.”

United States, a landmark constitutional climate lawsuit. 

The youth plaintiffs  filed  (link is external)  a petition asking the Court to clarify the proper role of the judiciary in addressing constitutional questions when children have demonstrated ongoing harm to their physical health and safety caused by federal fossil fuel policies. The amicus brief filed by members of Congress emphasized that all citizens, including young people, should have the right to access the courts to obtain relief and protect themselves from government policies that harm them. 

In their brief to the Supreme Court, the members of Congress are calling on the Supreme Court to correct the Ninth Circuit's overreach and allow the Juliana plaintiffs to proceed to trial. The lawmakers argued they have a "special interest in preserving the separation of powers" and the laws that Congress enacted giving federal courts the power to declare constitutional rights. The members also filed the brief to ensure "that the federal government fulfills its obligations to respect fundamental rights of life and liberty by safeguarding the environment for current and future generations." 

“[Juliana plaintiffs] seek a declaration that their Fifth Amendment rights depend upon a viable climate and that the federal government’s ongoing conduct violates their fundamental rights to life and personal security. This question of constitutional construction is one that the federal courts have the competence and the responsibility to answer,”  they continued. 

“[T]he federal courts have a vital role in declaring the scope of the petitioners’ Fifth Amendment rights and the government’s constitutional obligations as a trustee of the climate for America’s youth,”  the lawmakers concluded.

11:02:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:02:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC —  Representatives Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), and Jahana Hayes (CT-05) reintroduced the  Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act  , bipartisan legislation to expand labor union participation on state and local workforce boards that allocate labor development and job training funds. 

The  Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act  is the first pillar in Rep. Sherrill’s Expanding Economic Opportunities in New Jersey Agenda, a legislative package she is beginning to introduce to bring back good-paying jobs to the Garden State, support businesses and the workforce, and make New Jersey a global hub of cutting-edge research and innovation. 

“Unions built the American middle class and continue to support New Jersey families with good wages and fair working conditions. However, I hear too often from our unions that low-quality workforce training programs are hurting workers and setting projects back. I am reintroducing the  Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act  to ensure that labor unions can have more of a say in how federal workforce training funds are allocated. With this bill, we can make sure that New Jerseyans get first-rate job training that will lead to good-paying job opportunities, while building the innovative projects that will launch New Jersey’s economy into the future,”  said Rep. Sherrill. 

“Labor unions have been unjustly sidelined for far too long in critical decisions about workforce funding and training—decisions that directly impact their members’ livelihoods and opportunities,”  said Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1)  . “Our bipartisan  Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act  corrects this imbalance by increasing labor representation on workforce boards and ensuring taxpayer dollars are invested where they matter most: in empowering workers and strengthening our economy. I will always have the backs of the hardworking men and women of PA-1 and across this nation who are the driving force behind our country’s prosperity.” 

"Workforce development programs connect workers with good-paying jobs and address labor shortages. To ensure these programs fulfill the needs of workers, labor unions must be represented on state and local workforce boards,"  said Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05).  "This bipartisan legislation will help amplify the voices of workers in decision making that directly impacts their communities." 

The bill has also been endorsed by the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. 

A Workforce Development Board acts like a Board of Directors for a region’s job training system; it determines the needs of the local job market and employers, delivers resources to those looking for work, oversees One-Stop Career Centers, and manages workforce investment programs in the community. Other members on these boards include employers, educators, and local government officials. 

Sherrill’s  Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Ac  t will expand labor representation on state and local workforce development boards from 20% to 30% of board positions. It will also add a definition of “labor organization” to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that allocates federal job training resources, to ensure that workforce funding is going toward legitimate labor groups. 

Rep. Sherrill is a fierce advocate for organized labor as a member of the Labor Caucus and as a granddaughter of a UAW worker. Rep. Sherrill is a strong advocate for the landmark Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which will expand collective bargaining rights nationwide and crack down on labor violations. She worked hard to secure critical prevailing wage requirements and labor protections within the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, as a member of the newly created House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, Rep. Sherrill introduced the  American Jobs and Competition Plan  — which aims to strengthen U.S. economic and national security and level the global playing-field for American workers and businesses.

11:02:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC —  Representatives Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) and Don Bacon (NE-02) reintroduced the bipartisan  Auto Theft Prevention Act  to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with federal funding to help combat auto thefts and stolen vehicle trafficking. 

The  Auto Theft Prevention Act  is the first pillar in Rep. Sherrill’s Improving Public Safety in the Garden State Agenda, a legislative package she is beginning to introduce this week to keep New Jersey families safe and support first responders. 

“Last year, I worked with police chiefs, local leaders, and residents across the district to bring home Community Project grants for automated license plate reader systems in Essex and Morris Counties — funding that will help us stop car thefts, high speed car chases, and associated home invasions. And we’ve seen positive results, including more cars recovered safely by the police. But our work is far from done, which is why I’m introducing the  Auto Theft Prevention Act  once again. This bipartisan, commonsense legislation will invest federal dollars into tools that are efficient and effective at keeping New Jerseyans safe,”  said Rep. Sherrill  . 

"We've got to pump the brakes on the rate of car thefts,"  said Rep. Bacon.  "Rep. Sherrill and I are partnering on the  Auto Theft Prevention Act  to equip our police forces with resources to find, stop, and deter car thieves from harming our communities. Thieves belong behind bars, not behind the wheel." 

This legislation will create a new competitive grant program within the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) to fund state and local law enforcement efforts to combat auto thefts. In addition, the legislation creates a new eligible use of funds within the existing COPS grant program that allows police departments to use funds on new equipment, hiring, and compensation to help combat auto thefts. It is designed to direct funding to areas of the country that are most impacted by auto thefts. 

Grants can be used by police departments to purchase equipment used to combat auto theft, such as law enforcement vehicles and license plate readers, hire additional law enforcement officers and support staff, fund overtime costs and additional compensation for law enforcement officers and support staff, provide resources for joint task forces, and fund law enforcement data collection and research activities related to combating auto theft. 

The legislation has been endorsed by the National Troopers Coalition, New Jersey State Troopers Fraternal Association, and New Jersey Association of Counties. 

Rep. Mikie Sherrill has been a leader in bringing back federal dollars for law enforcement agencies throughout New Jersey. She secured $1.9 million in  Community Project funding  for automated license plate readers (ALPRs) in Morris and Essex Counties to combat auto thefts and violent crime. Through the American Rescue Plan, she delivered $10 million in federal funding for the New Jersey State Police and local law enforcement agencies to install ALPRs. Over the past four years, she has also brought back almost $200 million in federal funding for New Jersey law enforcement, including through the COPS and Byrne-JAG programs.

11:02:12 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:02:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC —  Representative Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) introduced her first new piece of legislation in the 119th Congress to boost New Jersey’s housing supply and lower costs for families. Sherrill’s  INCREASE Housing Affordability Act  would bring federal tax credits back to New Jersey to help convert underutilized commercial and office space into residential units, as well as provide federal technical assistance to municipalities to help them identify and advance promising commercial-to-residential conversion opportunities. 

The  INCREASE Housing Affordability Act  is the first pillar in Rep. Sherrill’s Lowering Costs for New Jersey Families Agenda, a legislative package she is beginning to introduce this week to make life more affordable and put money back into New Jerseyans’ pockets. 

“I hear from families all across the Garden State that life is just too expensive — and in particular that the cost of housing is far too high. That’s why the very first bill I am introducing this Congress is the INCREASE Housing Affordability Act — legislation to provide federal tax credits for projects that convert vacant commercial and office spaces into affordable residential units, while incentivizing developers to keep prices low and use union labor for construction. I was proud to work with housing advocates, elected officials, and labor leaders across the state to develop this bill to boost our housing supply for the ‘Missing Middle’ — so working families can find homes in their communities, our kids can find housing units in New Jersey as young adults, and our seniors can afford to retire with dignity in the communities they love and call home,”  said Rep. Sherrill  . 

Sherrill’s INCREASE Housing Affordability Act has earned endorsements from the Laborers' International Union of North America, Greater Middlesex & Morris Habitat for Humanity, Family Promise, New Jersey Realtors, JBWS, Mental Health Association of Morris and Essex, and SchoolHOUSE Connection. 

“LIUNA thanks Congresswoman Sherrill for her leadership to create more affordable housing in New Jersey. What's more, by incentivizing strong labor standards on affordable housing projects, this legislation will help protect workers, stabilize the construction industry, and ensure that public funds are reaching the workers who build and not the dishonest contractors who cheat the system, exploit workers, and line their pockets with public funds gained through illegal and unethical means,”  said Michael Hellstrom, Vice President and Eastern Regional Manager of the Laborers' International Union of North America.  “New Jersey needs more affordable housing options, and Mikie Sherril's proposal will not only help bridge the gap between household income and housing costs, but will lead to stronger communities by promoting economic stability, stronger families, and fairer business practices.” 

“The ‘INCREASE Housing Affordability Act’ offers a practical and innovative solution to the housing crisis. By encouraging the conversion of underutilized commercial buildings into affordable residential units, this new legislation will increase the housing supply and leverage existing infrastructure improvements, with little to no impact to natural resources. We applaud Representative Sherrill’s commitment to addressing the housing crisis with a solution that will revitalize communities, create jobs and promote sustainability,”  said Liz DeCoursey, CEO of Greater Middlesex & Morris Habitat for Humanity. 

“Each year in the Unites States, over 2.5 million children experience homelessness, a crisis exacerbated by the growing affordable housing crisis. Family Promise applauds Rep. Sherrill’s efforts to bring innovative solutions to the table, and we are proud to endorse this legislation, which would expand housing supply for those who need it most,”  said Cheryl Schuch, CEO of Family Promise. 

“This legislation will create new pathways for residential housing, while addressing the issue of vacant commercial spaces. This will directly impact New Jersey's housing supply and affordability issue. NJ Realtors® applauds Rep. Sherrill for her leadership on this issue,”  said Angela Sicoli, Federal Political Coordinator, New Jersey Realtors  . 

“A lack of affordable housing can cause survivors to stay in or return to abusive relationships. Affordable housing empowers victims of domestic violence to escape abuse, support their children’s well-being, and regain independence. Rep. Sherrill’s legislation providing tax credits for the conversion of commercial to affordable residential housing projects will not only improve futures for survivors and their children, it will save lives,”  said Diane M. Williams, President & CEO of JBWS. 

“Safe, affordable, and stable housing is essential for good mental health. Our long experience at the Mental Health Association has taught us that housing helps reduce anxiety and lift depression. The stress of inadequate housing is all encompassing, especially for our children,”  said Bob Davison, CEO of the Mental Health Association of Essex and Morris, Inc.  Congresswoman Sherrill’s bill is an innovative solution and an important tool in the mental health tool box. These concrete and actionable steps will make a difference.” 

“Lack of affordable housing undermines children’s health, development, and education,”  said Barbara Duffield, Executive Director of SchoolHouse Connection.  “By incentivizing the conversion of underutilized commercial spaces into affordable housing, Congresswoman Sherrill’s legislation offers a critical opportunity to increase affordable housing options for those who need it most. This innovative approach will help ensure that more children and youth have access to a stable home, giving them a chance to grow, learn, and thrive.” 

The INCREASE Housing Affordability Act supports commercial-to-residential building conversions to help boost the supply of affordable housing and lower costs for families. The legislation provides a tax credit for projects that convert underutilized commercial office space into residential units (with bonus credits for new units that are affordable for families at 100%, 80%, and 60% of area median income, as well as for projects that pay prevailing wages to their workers) and creates a federal advisory board to help state and local housing agencies identify and advance promising office conversion opportunities. 

Rep. Mikie Sherrill has been a leader in lowering housing costs and expanding housing supply in New Jersey. She secured $3 million in federal Community Project funding to help  Morris Habitat for Humanity  complete the construction of 25 affordable homes in Morris County. She has brought back millions of dollars to New Jersey in federal Housing Choice Vouchers to help families afford their rent and Public Housing Fund assistance to help New Jersey build and maintain affordable housing units. Sherrill has led the bipartisan  Homeless Children and Youth Act  , federal legislation that would ensure that children have a safe place to call home every night. Additionally, she has  spearheaded legislation  to provide incentives for brownfields cleanup and remediation in order to repurpose vacant lots.

11:02:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:02:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC —  Representative Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) joined Representative Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06) to reintroduce the Head Start Education and Development Workforce Advancement and Yield (HEADWAY) Act. This bipartisan bill will help address staffing shortages at Early Head Start programs, and in turn, expand access to high quality, affordable early childhood education. 

The HEADWAY Act is the first pillar in Rep. Sherrill’s Protecting Our Jersey Quality of Life Agenda, a legislative package she is beginning to introduce this week to make life easier and tackle the biggest challenges facing New Jersey families. 

“Head Start is a critical program that ensures parents can find high-quality early education and get back to work without breaking the bank. However, I hear from Head Start and other child care providers across New Jersey time and again about the challenges they face trying to find staff, limiting the number of families they can serve which creates financial hardship for parents and providers. The HEADWAY Act will address staffing shortages at Early Head Start programs and provide job opportunities to New Jerseyans pursuing a career in early childhood education. This bill is an important step in the right direction as we work to lower costs and expand high quality child care access to every New Jersey family,”  said Rep. Sherrill 

“As a dad of six, I understand firsthand the critical role early childhood development programs play and the need to expand access for students and families in need,”  said Rep. Ciscomani  . “With 22 Head Start programs across 500 locations in Arizona, these programs are critical to the well-being of our families and students. However, too often families in need are unable to access these programs due to the shortage in the childcare workforce. The HEADWAY Act makes great strides to address the staffing shortages by investing in our educators and ensuring that students and families in need have access to these vital programs.” 

“The HEADWAY Act will empower Early Head Start programs by reducing entry-level hiring barriers and supporting new early childhood educators in their professional development. Encouraging programs to ‘grow their own’ will help ensure they have the qualified staff necessary to serve as many eligible children and families as possible,”  said National Head Start Association Executive Director Yasmina Vinci.  “We applaud Reps. Ciscomani and Sherrill for introducing this bipartisan legislation which will provide a critical first professional stepping stone for staff while improving Early Head Start's capacity and ensuring we remain competitive and adaptable in an ever-changing workforce market.” 

The HEADWAY Act would allow Early Head Start classroom teachers to teach while earning their Child Development Associate (CDA) credentials. Doing so would give Head Start programs greater hiring flexibility while supporting education professionals and increasing program spots available to families in need of child care. The legislation has been endorsed by the National Head Start Association, and championed by Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA). 

Rep. Sherrill is a fierce advocate for child care and early education programs which are essential to New Jersey’s economy and workforce. She introduced the  Child Care for Every Community Act  (link is external)  , to ensure access to high-quality, affordable child care and early learning opportunities by establishing a network of federally-supported, locally-administered child care options modeled after the Head Start program. Additionally, she is fighting for the  Child Care Stabilization Act  , which would extend critical federal grants to child care facilities in New Jersey and across the country and has co-led multiple letters to Congressional leadership urging the inclusion of critical child care funding in upcoming appropriations packages.

11:02:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  Oil and Gas Executive Chis Wright makes clear he will unleash energy policies that will threaten the climate in his confirmation hearing 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today,  Representative Melanie Stansbury (NM-01)  released a statement following the Senate confirmation hearing of Donald Trump’s nominee for Energy Secretary, Chris Wright. 

“Donald Trump has made clear he will dismantle U.S. climate policies and has nominated a climate denier and oil and gas executive to lead the Department of Energy—which is why Chris Wright is unfit to be Secretary of Energy, period,” said  Rep. Melanie Stansbury (NM-01)  . “As the nation is grappling with devastating wildfires and increasing natural disasters, all we have to do is look outside to understand we are in the midst of a climate crisis. We need leaders who will follow the science and who are not beholden to the oil and gas industry. 

“Wright has said, ‘The hype over wildfires is just hype,’ and that ‘There is no climate crisis' or 'energy transition either.’ It is clear Wright is here to advance Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ agenda. As we reach critical climate tipping points, we must prioritize clean energy—not kowtowing to corporate interests and their friends. 

“Americans deserve leaders who will protect their health, their safety, their lives, and the planet. Chris Wright is not that leader.” 

Rep. Stansbury is a climate leader on Capitol Hill and nationally. She has served on the House Committee on Natural Resources since being elected to Congress in 2021 and worked in the field of water and climate sustainability for more than 20 years. Last year, Rep. Stansbury helped lead climate justice work on the Committee and back home with numerous roundtables with state, local, and tribal leaders, and industry, labor, and community advocates.

11:02:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Melanie Stansbury (NM-01)  released the following statement pushing back on false claims made by House Republicans during the first full hearing of the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee. GOP leadership claimed the hearing would address the implications of telework within the federal workforce when in reality it was the continuation of Trump’s Project 2025 plan to fire thousands of hard-working federal employees: 

“It’s time to pull back the curtain on the bigger agenda,” said  Rep. Melanie Stansbury (NM-01)  . "This hearing is about setting the stage for dismantling the federal workforce. House Republicans want to dismantle the federal workforce and leave thousands of hardworking federal employees out to dry. 

“Federal employees are dedicated professionals who continue to serve the American people day in and day out, regardless of their work environment. Our federal workers have adapted to telework with resilience and innovation to ensure that essential services remain uninterrupted. 

"We need to make sure that the federal government can provide essential services and that the American people can put food on the table and a roof over their heads, and I will continue to fight to protect federal employees every step of the way. We must continue investing in the federal workforce because when we support our workers we strengthen our nation and our economy.”

11:02:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24)  today released the following statement on her appointment to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). 

Established in 1977, HPSCI is responsible for overseeing the U.S. Intelligence Community, which encompasses the intelligence and related activities of the U.S. Government, including the Military Intelligence Program. 

"I am honored to have been named to serve on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for the 119th Congress, and thank Speaker Johnson for this prestigious appointment. At this pivotal moment in our nation's history, I am committed to ensuring that our intelligence community has the resources and support necessary to strengthen our national security capabilities. Facilities such as Fort Drum, Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, and Rome Lab in upstate New York are critical to our national security. I am dedicated to advocating on behalf of these premiere defense sites as a part of our critical national security asset base. I look forward to working with President Trump, Speaker Johnson, HPSCI Chairman Crawford, and my colleagues to strengthen our defense capabilities and uphold essential oversight of our nation's intelligence operations,"  said Congresswoman Tenney. 

“In an increasingly dangerous world with hot wars around the globe, multi-faceted threats from China, and terrorists within our borders, the mission of our intelligence community is vitally important. Congress has a responsibility to conduct thorough oversight of these intelligence systems to ensure we are safeguarding the American people and our national interests while also strictly adhering to the Constitution,"  said Speaker of the House Mike Johnson  .

11:02:27 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:02:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24)  today introduced the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA) to ensure that states are prohibited from banning the manufacture, sale, importation, or possession of any rifle or shotgun that is lawfully permitted under federal law. 

Additional cosponsors of this legislation include Representative Doug LaMalfa (CA-1) and Nick Langworthy (NY-23). 

New York's SAFE Act, signed into law under disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo, prohibits law-abiding New Yorkers from purchasing, transferring, and owning certain firearms. If signed into law, this SAGA Act would nullify the SAFE Act and prevent New York and other states from passing unconstitutional gun bans. 

"The Constitution clearly established our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The SAGA Act nullifies New York's unconstitutional SAFE Act and prevents other states from enacting laws that violate the Second Amendment. This legislation upholds our country's founding principle of protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans, even from liberal states with anti-gun policies,"  said Congresswoman Tenney. 

"No matter how hard radical Democrats in Albany attempt to limit lawful gun ownership, the New York Congressional delegation will stand firm to protect law-abiding New Yorkers and manufacturers in protecting their constitutional rights. I am proud to join Rep. Tenney and my New York colleagues in Congress to ensure these rights ‘shall not be infringed, and I will never back down in my fight to protect the Second Amendment,”  said Congressman Langworthy. \ufeff

11:02:33 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:02:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Representative Young Kim (CA-40) joined Reps. Andrew Garbarino (NY-02), Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Rob Menendez (NJ-08), Chris Smith (NJ-04), Brad Schneider (IL-10), Mike Lawler (NY-17), and Tom Suozzi (NY-03) to cut taxes by introducing the Securing Access to Lower Taxes by ensuring (SALT) Deductibility Act. 

This bipartisan bill would provide Californians much-needed tax relief by fully repealing the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. 

Rep. Kim serves as co-chair of the bipartisan SALT Caucus and introduced this bill in the  117  th  and  118  th  Congresses. She recently  visited  Mar-a-Lago with SALT Caucus members to meet with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss SALT. 

“The cap on SALT deductions unfairly punishes our Southern California communities, who are already burdened enough by high state and local taxes and rising living costs,”  said Rep. Kim, SALT Caucus Co-Chair.  “Repealing the SALT cap isn’t bailing out blue states – it’s providing relief to middle class families I represent and allowing hardworking American taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money. I’ll keep fighting to get this done.” 

“Since the SALT deduction cap was implemented, hardworking Americans from states like New York have been suffering from unfair double taxation—all while receiving a fraction of what they contribute in federal funds,”  said Rep. Garbarino, SALT Caucus Co-Chair.  “Enough is enough. We are calling for a full repeal of the cap that disproportionately impacts middle-class families in our districts.” 

“I am pleased to join my bipartisan SALT Caucus Co-Chairs, Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), Young Kim (R-CA), and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) to introduce the bipartisan SALT Deductibility Act to reinstate the full SALT Deduction!”  said Rep. Suozzi, SALT Caucus Co-Chair.  “The SALT cap has been a body blow to my constituents, and I will continue to fight to restore this important deduction.” 

“For nearly a decade, New Jerseyans have been disproportionately impacted by the cap on SALT deductions,”  said Rep. Menendez  . “As we work to combat the rising cost of housing, childcare, and everyday living, it’s vital that we give families and individuals access to every available tool to make life more affordable. I’m grateful to be working on a bipartisan basis to bring real tax relief to New Jerseyans and look forward to getting this across the finish line.” 

“The unfair cap on the SALT deduction has hurt families and communities in my district in Illinois for the last 6 years,”  said Rep. Schneider.  “Capping the SALT deduction has resulted in double taxation by forcing constituents to pay federal tax on money they have already paid to state and local governments. I’m proud to join this bipartisan bill to restore the full deduction and bring much-needed relief to the communities I represent.” 

“I’m proud to be introducing bipartisan legislation with Republicans and Democrats from across the country to fix the unfair cap on SALT. We are going to get this done in the 119th Congress, and I’m proud to be partnering with Rep. Garbarino and other colleagues on this important effort,”  said Rep. Lawler. 

Additional cosponsors of the SALT Deductibility Act include Representatives Sean Casten (IL-06), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Danny Davis (IL-07), Tom Kean Jr. (NJ-07), Judy Chu (CA-28), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Jerry Nadler (NY-12), Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Laura Gillen (NY-04), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Pat Ryan (NY-18), Jamie Raskin (MD-08), and Jimmy Gomez (CA-34).

Rep. Kim served on these subcommittees in the 118  th  Congress and is co-chair of the bipartisan Financial Literacy and Wealth Creation Caucus. 

“Policies from Congress should make lives easier for Americans who are hurting from persistent inflation, rising living costs, and burdensome regulations,”  said Rep. Young Kim.  “I look forward to working with Financial Services Committee Chairman Hill and colleagues on both sides of the aisle on policies to cut federal red tape and empower Americans to grow their wealth and achieve their dream.” 

“As a member of the House Committees on Financial Services and Foreign Affairs, Rep. Kim brings her wealth of knowledge on business and global affairs to the Financial Institutions and National Security Subcommittees on Financial Services. The intersection of finance when it comes to our national security is critical, and I am confident Rep. Kim will continue to be a champion for safeguarding our national security and use her background as a former small business owner to fight against burdensome regulations and ensure our small businesses thrive across America,”  said Chairman French Hill.

11:02:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: Chino Hills, CA – The Office of U.S. Representative Young Kim (CA-40) announced that Troy High School students Stanley Wang, from Chino Hills, and Jack Liu are the winners of the 2024 CA-40 Congressional App Challenge. 

Their app, “Gluconnect,” aims to support those with diabetes by turning any standard blood-sugar meter, or glucometer, into a Bluetooth-enabled one to allow for the transmission of blood data over Bluetooth. The app also allows users to view, manage, and share data with trusted family members and healthcare providers. 

The students were inspired to create “Gluconnect” after hearing family members with diabetes express frustration with manually inputting and tracking data from their glucometers. 

“Stanley and Jack’s app ‘Gluconnect’ not only demonstrates an impressive use of coding concepts but also could improve the lives of diabetes patients. They truly went above and beyond, and I’m proud to name this year’s CA-40 Congressional App Challenge winners,”  said Rep. Young Kim.  “As always, I’m so impressed by this year’s Congressional App Challenge submissions and amazed by the caliber of talent among students in California’s 40  th  District.” 

Congresswoman Young Kim is the Co-Chair of the Women in STEM caucus and served as co-chair of the Congressional App Challenge in the 117th Congress. 640 students have participated in the Congressional App Challenge and 293 apps have been submitted from students for her district since 2021.

Rep. Kim is one of the first Korean American women to serve in Congress. She led a similar resolution in the 118  th  Congress, 117th Congress, and during her time in the California State Assembly to honor her heritage and the more than 2 million Korean Americans in the United States. 

“For 122 years, Korean Americans have found success in the classroom, the workplace, and even right here in the halls of Congress, working to make our nation a better place,”  said Rep. Young Kim.  “I’m proud to help lead a bipartisan resolution honoring Korean American Day as one of the first Korean American women in Congress and the representative of a vibrant Korean American community in Southern California. I’ll keep fighting in Congress to ensure the American dream I have lived remains alive for future generations.” 

“Korean Americans have made incredible contributions to our nation in art, business, education, as well as the private and public sectors, and their story continues to inspire communities across the country,”  said Rep. Jimmy Gomez.  “I’m introducing this resolution with Representative Young Kim and Senator Andy Kim to commemorate Korean American Day and celebrate the hard work, family bonds, and unbreakable spirit of Korean Americans. As the representative of LA’s Koreatown, the largest population of Korean Americans in the U.S., I’ll continue to work alongside the Korean American community to achieve more progress in LA and across the country.” 

54 colleagues joined Reps. Kim and Gomez as original cosponsors of the resolution, including fellow Korean American Reps. Dave Min (CA-47) and Marilyn Strickland (WA-10). Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK).

11:02:40 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  The bill, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), was marked up by the Committee on Oversight & Accountability last Congress. 

WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) condemned a bill introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) that would exempt certain organizations doing business in D.C. from registering with the District, the same requirement states regularly enforce. The bill appears to be politically motivated, introduced in response to a reported investigation by the D.C. Attorney General into a conservative legal activist for misusing charitable funds for the activist’s personal benefit. 

“The D.C. Attorney General apparently did something Rep. Biggs considers radical: He enforced D.C.’s Nonprofit Corporation Act,” Norton said. “The D.C. Attorney General is reportedly investigating nonprofits affiliated with a conservative legal activist for misusing charitable funds for the activist’s personal benefit. 

“In response to D.C.’s Attorney General doing his job, Rep. Biggs reintroduced this anti-home rule bill that violates the District of Columbia’s right to self-government. It would amend a D.C. law to exempt certain business organizations doing business in the District from registering with D.C., even though each state requires business organizations, whether for-profit or nonprofit, doing business in that state to register there. The intent of this bill is to reduce D.C.’s authority to apply its laws to nonprofits that are formed under the laws of another jurisdiction doing business in D.C., and I strongly oppose it.”

11:02:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: ##  The House passed the bill in the 117th and 118th Congresses. 

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) announced that her bill to revoke the independent real estate leasing authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and direct the Government Accountability Office to update its 2016 report on independent real estate leasing authority has passed the House. The House  passed the bill  for the first time in 2022. 

"House passage brings the federal government a step closer to eliminating the inefficient, wasteful, and redundant involvement of the Securities and Exchange Commission in real estate decisions when the General Services Administration exists for that very reason," Norton said. "The SEC should focus on its core mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation — not on real estate procurements. Congress created this problem by granting the SEC leasing authority, and now Congress must fix it by revoking that authority. I look forward to Senate passage of this important bill." 

Under the bill, the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal government's civilian real estate arm, would handle SEC real estate procurements. Congress granted the SEC independent leasing authority in 1990, before Norton was in Congress. Since then, the SEC has wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars as it has stumbled through leasing mistake after leasing mistake. 

Norton first introduced this bill after the SEC engaged in an improper sole-source procurement of nearly one million square feet of leased space. Then-SEC Chairwoman Mary L. Schapiro promised in a congressional hearing that the SEC would allow GSA to handle its real estate procurements to avoid such issues in the future. However, the SEC effectively vetoed a multi-million-dollar procurement completed on its behalf by GSA. The SEC then refused to document its concerns to Congress, and justified its actions using the leasing authority it had previously promised not to use. In September 2021, after much back and forth between the two agencies, GSA entered into a headquarters lease for the SEC, and the SEC said it will use GSA in future real estate procurements. Norton's bill would ensure that while the SEC would continue to have input in the decision-making process, the ultimate real estate authority would lie with GSA in the future.

11:02:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) introduced a bill to create a local prosecutor's office, designated under local law, to prosecute all local crimes in the District of Columbia. Under federal law, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, a federal entity, is responsible for prosecuting almost all local crimes committed by adults here, the greater part of its caseload, in addition to prosecuting federal crimes. Norton noted that the territories of the United States all have local prosecutors to prosecute local crimes. Her bill would effectuate a 2002 advisory referendum, approved by 82 percent of D.C. voters, to create a local prosecutor's office. 

"A U.S. Attorney has no business prosecuting the local crimes of a jurisdiction, an out-of-date status quo that harkens to pre-home-rule D.C.," Norton said. "The overwhelming majority of the U.S. Attorney's current caseload is local crimes. The U.S. Attorney for the nation's capital should be committed solely to the important federal matters that come to this office. D.C. should solely be responsible for prosecuting local crimes. My bill would simply give D.C. the same authority that the states and U.S. territories enjoy as an essential element of self-government." 

Norton’s introductory statement follows. 

Statement of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton 

on the Introduction of the 

District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act 

January 13, 2025 

Today, I introduce the District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act, which would give D.C. the authority to prosecute all crimes committed under its laws. Congress already allows D.C. to write D.C. criminal laws and allows D.C. to enforce them against some violators. Congress should allow D.C. to enforce D.C. laws against all violators. This bill would effectuate a 2002 advisory referendum, approved by 82 percent of D.C. voters, to create a local prosecutor’s office. 

Currently, the U.S. Attorney for D.C. has the authority to prosecute most D.C. crimes committed by adults and some by juveniles, while the D.C. Attorney General has the authority to prosecute most D.C. crimes committed by juveniles and some by adults. Giving D.C. the authority to prosecute all D.C. crimes would not only give D.C. residents a say in the enforcement of all their laws, it also would save the federal government tens of millions of dollars a year by reducing the number of assistant U.S. attorneys in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. 

In the 117  th  Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill as part of my District of Columbia Home Rule Expansion Act of 2022. 

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

“Fighting for workers must be the north star for any Secretary of Labor. As one of the only Republicans to cosponsor the PRO Act, Representative Chavez-DeRemer recognizes the importance of strengthening unions, and we met today to discuss her vision for the Department. I pressed her on how she plans to strengthen protections for workers and raise wages while serving in an administration that has repeatedly prioritized billionaires and corporations at the expense of working people. If confirmed, I’m hopeful we can work together to create more jobs in Connecticut and defeat efforts to roll back the progress we’ve made in the past four years.”

11:02:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:02:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—  U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)  on Wednesday spoke on the U.S. Senate floor to call out Republicans' proposed tax plan, which would disproportionately benefit the top 1% at the expense of working-class American families. Murphy warned ~~that~~ the plan would be financed by deep cuts to essential services like Medicare and Medicaid, with 80% of the benefits going to corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers. 

“The tax cut we're talking about extending gives a tax cut for the top 1% of earners in this country. That isn't ten times bigger than working families at the bottom of the income scale. It's not 100 times bigger. It's not 500 times bigger. Taxpayers in the top 1% will get a tax cut 852 times larger than working families at the bottom of the income thresholds. Eight hundred fifty-two times bigger,"  said Murphy. 

Murphy continued:  “What we have seen coming out of the pandemic is that while the broad middle of the country has been struggling, the wealthy have gotten richer and richer and richer. We have more billionaires than ever before in this country. The folks that don't rely on salaries, that can just plow their income and their earnings into the capital markets, have reaped huge, huge rewards. The very, very wealthy in this country right now, at this moment in time, don't need any more help. And yet the average family that is in that top 1% bracket is going to get a tax cut, on average, of $70,000. Well, if you make $30,000 in this country, you're going to get about $100 back in your pocket.” 

Murphy emphasized that to pay for their tax bill, Republicans will make devastating cuts to essential programs:  “At the end of last year, as a means of passing the continuing resolution, there was a deal apparently cut–this was reported in the press–in which there was a promise made to finance the tax cut with $2 trillion of cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid: poor kids, poor families. Medicare: seniors in this country. Two trillion dollars is a hard number to get your head wrapped around. But there's no way to enact $2 trillion, $2 trillion, a “T,” worth of cuts in Medicare and Medicaid without hundreds of thousands of people, senior citizens and poor kids, losing access to care. Two trillion dollars in cuts means the nursing homes are shut down. People are put out on the streets. It means that poor kids don't get access to mental health services. And so, what happened eight years ago was cruel. A tax cut put on the American public's credit card. 80% of the benefits going to the very, very richest, none of it trickling down.” 

Murphy concluded:  “This version that Republicans are talking about passing in a matter of weeks is even more cruel. Because it is the same balance, the benefit going to the very, very wealthy – President-elect Trump's friends who pay to get in and out of Mar-A-Lago – but financed immediately by cuts that are going to be devastating for the people in this country who get up every day relying on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. So, I agree with my friend from Hawaii: we've got to be down on the floor talking about this every single day. Folks thought it was an inevitability eight years ago when Republicans made it a priority to steal health insurance from 20 million Americans, and by the skin of our teeth, we were able to save health insurance for 20 million Americans. Maybe, if we raise enough of a fuss about this massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very, very wealthy, we can stop this egregious policy as well.” 

A full transcript of his remarks can be found below: 

MURPHY:  “Thank you very much, Senator. I just can't believe we're talking about something that nobody wants. That's what this comes down to. The number one priority for Republicans is extending, and likely expanding, a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest 1%, 0.1%, in this country at a rate that dwarfs –  dwarfs  – the help for anyone else. 

“The tax cut we're talking about extending gives a tax cut for the top 1% of earners in this country. That isn't ten times bigger than working families at the bottom of the income scale. It's not 100 times bigger. It's not 500 times bigger. Taxpayers in the top 1% will get a tax cut 852 times larger than working families at the bottom of the income thresholds. Eight hundred fifty-two times bigger. 

“And what we have seen coming out of the pandemic is that while the broad middle of the country has been struggling, the wealthy have gotten richer and richer and richer. We have more billionaires than ever before in this country. The folks that don't rely on salaries, that can just plow their income and their earnings into the capital markets, have reaped huge, huge rewards. 

“And so, the very, very wealthy in this country right now, at this moment in time, don't need any more help. And yet the average family that is in that top 1% bracket is going to get a tax cut, on average, of $70,000. Well, if you make $30,000 in this country, you're going to get about $100 back in your pocket. 

“And of course the theory is that if you just layer on tax cuts for corporations and for billionaires and millionaires, that money will eventually trickle down to everybody else. That's a lie. That's not true. That's a fraud. It's never been true. It's been perpetuated on the American public because it's a great way to rationalize giving the bulk of tax cuts to the very, very wealthy. The idea is that somehow that will make it down to the rest of us. 

“Go on to any main street of this country, go into any subdivision in your state, you won't find many of your constituents who make $50,000 or $100,000 or even $200,000 that have had much of that trickle down to them. 

“And to Senator Schatz' point, eight years ago when the tax cut was first put into place, it was egregious not because of the balance only, but also because the whole thing was borrowed. All that money was just put on the American credit card, a credit card that comes due and ends up getting paid by middle-class families one way or the other. 

“This time around, I guess the good news is they're talking about paying for it, not borrowing to give a huge tax cut to corporations and to billionaires and millionaires. Instead, they're talking about immediately taking money out of the pockets of working families and seniors and poor people. Instead of borrowing money and have the bill come due for middle-class families later, this new tax cut for billionaires and corporations is going to be financed by an immediate cut to services and benefits to some of the most vulnerable people in this country. 

“At the end of last year, as a means of passing the continuing resolution, there was a deal apparently cut–this was reported in the press–in which there was a promise made to finance the tax cut with $2 trillion of cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid: poor kids, poor families. Medicare: seniors in this country. Two trillion dollars is a hard number to get your head wrapped around.

11:02:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—  U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.),  a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday questioned U.S. Senator Marco Rubio at a hearing on his nomination for U.S. Secretary of State. Murphy voiced concerns about the Trump family’s foreign business dealings and challenged Rubio on how he would navigate corruption, national security priorities, and America’s standing as a global leader. He also pressed Rubio on his plans for addressing competition with China, promoting Middle East security, and combatting foreign disinformation to safeguard democracy and human rights around the world. 

A full transcript of Murphy’s exchange with Rubio can be found below: 

MURPHY:  “Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. That is, indeed, good news. Senator Rubio, I want to talk to you about a topic that I think is going to be real trouble for you and for U.S. national security interests, at least for the first few minutes of my time, and that’s the growing personal financial entanglement of President Trump, his family, and Middle East governments. I’ll give you an example of what I’m talking about. 

“For nearly eight years, the Trump Organization has been pursuing a real estate deal to build a hotel complex in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. During President Trump’s first term, the Trump Organization actually voluntarily committed to refrain from pursuing real estate deals with foreign companies, especially those that are backed by foreign governments. So the deal didn’t go through. And then it remained stalled for the entirety of the Biden administration. And then, magically, 30 days after the November election, Saudi Arabia’s biggest construction company, that’s affiliated with the government, announced that the deal was going forward, alongside an additional $200 million deal for a Trump property in Oman. 

“Now, it used to be that somebody with these big financial business interests would come into government and take actions, like setting up a blind trust or divestment, in order to make sure there was no connection between their personal financial interests and the business they were conducting in government. But President Trump has just done the opposite. 

“Over the last eight years, while he was in office and since he’s been out of office, he and his family have become more deeply dependent on revenue from governments in the Middle East. During his last presidency, Middle East interests sent around $10 million to Trump properties. After he left office, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was his primary Middle East envoy, was handed $2 billion in investment by the Saudis, even though a Saudi investment board said the investment was a bad business decision. That investment actually comes up for renewal in 2026, giving the Saudis massive leverage over the Trump family. 

“And then to make matters worse, right after the election, the Trump Organization said that in this term – the president-elect’s second term – it would drop its previous prohibition on doing new deals in the Middle East with private foreign companies aligned with foreign governments. So, the Trump Organization is going to be signing new business deals in the Middle East with private companies that have connections to foreign governments at the very moment that you are going to be conducting sensitive diplomacy in these countries. 

“That’s just extraordinary. Never before in the history of this country has a president been literally receiving cash from foreign governments, and from foreign companies that are backed by foreign governments in the middle of their term. If you or I had done this as Senators, we would be in violent violation of Senate ethics rules. That’s not permitted on the Foreign Relations Committee. 

“So I guess my question to you is a pretty simple one. Do you see how this fundamentally compromises your diplomatic efforts? Do you have an issue, or will you raise an issue with the President, about his growing financial connection with the governments that you are going to be negotiating with?” 

RUBIO:  “Well first of all, I am neither authorized nor in any position to give you any insights into any of these arrangements you pointed out. You mentioned Jared Kushner as an example. He is a private citizen, happens to be a Floridian. I don't know what if any engagement he has in the work that’s going on now. I can tell you what I know – obviously I’m not at the State Department yet – but I can tell you as an example, the President's envoy to that region, Steve Witkoff, who was charged with being an envoy towards reaching an accommodation between the Israelis and the Saudis, has been working cooperatively and together with the Biden administration. And, in fact, I dare to say that all involved deserve credit for the ceasefire that the Chairman’s just announced, but Steve Witkoff has been a critical component of it, and he has been involved in it from day one. 

“I think the broader consideration about whether we want to see a Saudi-Israeli mutual recognition and relationship would be one of the most historic developments in the history of the region for all of the factors we discussed here today. It would be – and one of the impediments to it has been this conflict and the ongoing conflict, and the lack of a ceasefire. I also think it’s going to be important for the Saudis and others to be participants in post-conflict stabilization efforts in Gaza and beyond. So, all I can tell you is what I have said from the very beginning, from my opening statement, and that is our foreign policy is going to be driven – as the President has made abundantly clear – by whether some action is in the interest of the United States and our national security. And that is what it is going to be driven by, and that’s how all these policies should be judged by, and that’s certainly the job that I have been tasked with executing on.” 

MURPHY:  “Well let me then simply ask you this question: Do you believe that the President should refrain from doing new business deals with Middle East governments during his term in office?” 

RUBIO:  “The President doesn't manage that company. His family members do, and they have a right to be in the business. That’s the business that they are in. They’re in the real estate business. They’ve been for a very long time, both domestically and abroad. They have properties in multiple countries. So at the end of the day, his family is entitled to continue to operate their business. The fundamental question is not whether his family’s involved in business, the fundamental question is whether that is in any way impacting the conduct of our foreign policy in a way that’s counter to our national interests. And the President has made it abundantly clear that every decision he makes and every decision we are to make at the State Department should be driven by whether or not it serves the core national interests of the United States. And that is how I hope our policies will be judged by, not what business his family is conducting while the President is here in Washington working, not on his business, but from the Oval Office.” 

MURPHY:  “You are correct, that is the fundamental question, whether or not a policy is being pursued in U.S. national security interests or due to the President's personal financial interest. That is the reason why, as United States Senators, we are not allowed to have complicated existing financial arrangements with foreign governments, because you do not want to create the impression that there is a conflict of motivation, and I just wished that this President applied to this incoming administration the same rules that we hold ourselves to as United States Senators. 

“Senator Rubio, in the time I have remaining, I just want to tackle two other topics. One that I know is of mutual concern to you and I, and that’s the need to confront China in non-military ways as they try to exert influence around the world. Last time President Trump was in office, he was calling for pretty massive cuts to the State Department's budget. But as you know, China uses all sorts of non-kinetic tools, like misinformation, economic diplomacy, around the world, to exert influence. I am hopeful that you are going to be an active voice to try to make sure that you have the tools, including when it comes to combating Russian and Chinese misinformation, to be able to confront all of the ways, many of them asymmetric, that China in particular, but Russia as well, presents challenges to U.S. interests. Just wanted to get your commitment to make sure to build that full comprehensive foreign policy toolkit.” 

RUBIO:  “Not only have I been so concerned about foreign disinformation, I’ve been the target of it, from multiple nation-states. And I have learned over time that the best way to confront disinformation is through a flood of free speech that allows the counter points of view to be heard and understood. I think where we get ourselves into trouble – and we have learned this now, and I think multiple U.S. companies are now admitting [this] – is when we get ourselves into a position of determining what is true and what is not, and then using the tools of government to go after them, particularly when it implicates domestic entities. But yes, it is one of the tools that they have in their toolbox. 

“By the way, it’s not just disinformation. It is flat out influencing nation-states’ views of the United States writ large by promoting conspiracy theories internally and [in] other countries that undermine us, and that undermine our standing, whether it is in Africa – and increasingly you see it in the Western Hemisphere as well. One of the best ways to combat that is to be present, to be there, to show what we do and to brag about what we do. One of the things that frustrates me the most is there are literally programs within USAID where they do not allow us to label it as ‘made in America’ or ‘a gift of the American people’ because it might offend someone locally. I think it’s important for the world to know what the United States is doing to help their societies. We do not do a good enough job of promoting what we have done historically, and continue to do, to help our fellow man around the world.” 

MURPHY:  “Yeah, China is spending $10 billion per year on that propaganda and misinformation operation. They celebrate when budgets get sent up to the Hill that propose big increases in military spending and giant decreases in the kind of tools that are available to you, so I do look forward to working with you to make sure that we’ve given you that full suite of tools necessary to confront our adversaries.”

“  After the horrors of October 7  th  and 15 agonizing months of war, this ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas is overdue, great news. I deeply appreciate the negotiators’ countless hours of diplomatic work to reach this agreement. It is a tragedy that it has taken this long to secure a deal whose parameters have been well known for months, but I am relieved that innocent hostages will be returned to their families and the suffering of millions of Palestinians can end as they start rebuilding their lives. This is the first tentative step towards peace, but there is still a long road ahead. I urge the new administration to remain actively engaged with all parties to support the ceasefire and ensure its phased and complete implementation to make it permanent.”

11:02:50 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:02:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: HARTFORD—  U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)  and  Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  and  U.S. Representative John B. Larson (D-Conn.-01)  on Monday joined Governor Ned Lamont, CTDOT Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto, and Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam to announce $2 million in federal funding for the Connecticut Department of Transportation for the City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study. The federal funding comes from the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program through the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  . 

"This project is about more than just rebuilding roads in Hartford—it’s about unlocking opportunities for local communities and creating a more connected future,” said Murphy. “This $2 million in federal funding will help improve traffic flow on I-84 and enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists, while opening up space for affordable housing and strengthening our neighborhoods' resilience to climate change for generations to come,"  said Murphy. 

“This $2 million in federal funding is a significant milestone for North Hartford, signaling strong support to reconnect a neighborhood that has for far too long been disconnected and divided. This investment supports a collaborative and inclusive vision that will revitalize the community, create good-paying jobs, and provide relief for residents. I’m proud to have fought for this funding and will continue to work to deliver federal resources that encourage economic development across our state,”  said Blumenthal. 

“With its focus on reconnecting communities, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we passed in Congress has created an opportunity to end the racial isolation in North Hartford and build a transportation system that connects residents across the Capitol Region,” said Larson. “By funding engineering efforts to realign and cap Interstate 84 in Hartford, this $2 million federal investment will move us one step close to finally fixing the egregious design flaws that have robbed our communities of their potential for far too long. Revitalization will not happen overnight, and it remains one of my top priorities to correct the injustices of the past by securing funding to modernize infrastructure and promote economic opportunity for the residents of North Hartford,”  said Larson. 

“As we are making necessary upgrades to our infrastructure, we should use this as an opportunity to review how our highways are impacting the local host communities and make adjustments that think ahead for long-term improvements with an eye toward economic growth for people who live in these neighborhoods. Our interstates have divided Hartford’s North End from the rest of the city for generations now, and this study will give those who live in the area a voice in how we can improve these roads so they work for everyone,”  said Lamont. 

“Funding for this study will help us advance the recommendations in the Greater Hartford Mobility Study as we look to reconnect the North End of Hartford to downtown, and undo some of the disruptions caused by the current highway system. Thank you to USDOT, Secretary Buttigieg, and our Congressional Delegation for the ongoing support on this project,”  said Eucalitto. 

"The City Link project represents a critical opportunity to heal historical divides in North Hartford. By reimagining our infrastructure, we're not just rebuilding roads, but reconnecting communities and creating pathways for economic opportunity. This $2 million federal investment will help us address long-standing inequities and give North Hartford residents a voice in shaping their neighborhood's future,"  said Arulampalam. 

The City Link – Reconnecting North Hartford planning study would complete collaborative visioning and analysis and preliminary engineering for the realignment, lowering and capping of Interstate 84 and the Hartford Line rail corridor in Hartford. The surrounding neighborhoods have long experienced historic disinvestment and are home to disadvantaged communities that have borne the brunt of the negative effects associated with the construction of the original highway in the mid-20th century.

11:02:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—  U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)  and  Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  joined  U.S. Representatives John Larson (D-Conn.-01), Joe Courtney (D-Conn.-02), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.-03), Jim Himes (D-Conn-04),  and  Jahana Hayes (D-Conn-05)  on Monday in urging farmers in Connecticut to report losses from extreme weather ~~s~~ events in 2023 and 2024 to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture (CT DoAg). Farmers can report losses  here  . 

The  Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant  , created by Representative DeLauro and championed by members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, provides $220 million to states in New England, Alaska, and Hawaii to help small and medium-sized farmers receive agricultural relief or aid for losses they experienced in 2023 and 2024 from any weather event. This block grant does not require farmers have crop insurance or a national disaster declaration to receive aid. This ensures that farmers left out of our farm safety net and those who suffer losses due to an extreme and localized weather event are able to recoup their losses. 

"We strongly encourage farmers in Connecticut to participate in the CT DoAg survey on weather-related losses from 2023 and 2024,”  the delegation said.  “This is a critical opportunity to ensure your needs are accounted for as the state prepares to distribute disaster funding for farmers. The Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant provided $220 million in disaster relief funding for farmers impacted by extreme weather events in 2023 and 2024 and is intended to help affected farmers recoup their losses from these unexpected disasters. Farmers sharing the challenges they faced—whether it’s production losses, infrastructure damage, or increased costs due to invasive species—can help CT DoAg understand the scope of the need to address it as best as they can as soon as funding is ready. Please fill out the survey if you experienced these losses – help will soon be available.” 

The survey will help the CT DoAg collect information from farmers regarding weather-related losses incurred in 2024 and 2024, as well as losses related to long-term stresses worsened by weather conditions during these two years. The data will help CT DoAg fully understand the scope of the losses so they can quickly divide and disburse funding when it is available.  The deadline to complete the survey is Sunday, January 19, 2025.

11:02:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: HARTFORD—  U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)  and  Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  , and  U.S. Representative Joe Courtney (D-Conn.-02)  , on Monday applauded the U.S. Navy’s decision to name the third Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, the largest and most capable submarine built by the United States, the “USS GROTON” after Groton, Connecticut. The USS GROTON is scheduled for delivery in 2032. U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, also announced that Cynthia Blumenthal will serve as the sponsor of the future USS Groton. Sponsors are selected by the Secretary of the Navy and hold a unique role by maintaining a lifelong relationship with the ship and crew. 

“It’s only fitting the U.S. Navy is naming our next Columbia Class submarine after Groton, Connecticut— the Submarine Capital of the World,”  said Murphy.  “This is a well-deserved recognition of Groton’s rich history as a global leader in submarine technology and innovation, and a home to the thousands of Electric Boat workers and small businesses who power our nation’s naval defense. I will continue to use my seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to make sure the next administration advances our submarine programs quickly and cost-effectively, supports our maritime industrial workforce, and ensures the full and timely delivery of the cutting-edge submarines we need to uphold our national security.” 

“Naming the USS GROTON recognizes this iconic Connecticut town as the submarine capitol of the world— honoring the unsurpassed skill and dedication of men and women who work there. Groton has a rich shipbuilding legacy, and proven commitment to our national defense— manufacturing and maintaining vital weapons platforms, and sustaining our undersea superiority. It is a proud community of hard workers, veterans, patriots, and public servants, and this honor celebrates them. I am proud that my wife, Cynthia, will be the sponsor of the USS GROTON and serve as a bond between the vessel, her crew, and our nation – an honor and privilege Cynthia is perfectly qualified to take on,”  said Blumenthal. 

“Today’s decision by the US Navy to honor Groton, Connecticut as the name of its next submarine is welcome news. Groton is the birthplace of the modern nuclear-powered Navy under Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and home to our nation’s oldest submarine base, as well as the Electric Boat shipyard whose talented shipbuilders have played a leading role since World War II where they constructed 74 submarines to fight the Axis powers. The naming of the third Columbia class submarine as the future USS GROTON is a well-deserved badge of honor that rightly acknowledges our community’s historic role in the United States submarine force,”  said Courtney. 

Groton, Connecticut is commonly referred to as the “Submarine Capital of the World” and is home to the United States Naval Submarine Base, General Dynamics Electric Boat, and the historic USS Nautilus and Submarine Force Museum. Groton is a leader in the country in designing, manufacturing, and sustaining the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet. Groton became known as the “Submarine Capital of the World” when the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics delivered 74 diesel submarines to the Navy in World War II.

11:02:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: HARTFORD—  U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)  and  Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  and  U.S. Representatives John Larson (D-Conn.-01), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.-03), Jim Himes (D-Conn-04),  and  Jahana Hayes (D-Conn-05)  joined Governor Ned Lamont to announce the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is awarding Connecticut approximately $11.6 million from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to increase and extend service along the CT  rail  Hartford Line. 

This funding is being awarded to the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) under the FRA’s Restoration and Enhancement Program to further expand rail services and improve customer service for riders along the corridor. The federal grant will be matched by approximately $13.4 million in state funds from CTDOT. 

“Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this $11.6 million federal investment in the Hartford Line will help cut down on travel times and pump billions of dollars into Connecticut’s economy, all while creating good-paying union jobs and reducing our carbon footprint,”  said Murphy.  “This is a big win for Connecticut commuters and for communities along the Hartford Line who will enjoy the benefits of more convenient, reliable transportation and sustained economic growth for years to come.” 

“This major grant is a monumental boost for Connecticut rail – more service, more reliably and safely. It’s great news for job growth and economic progress,”  said Blumenthal. 

“I am glad to join Governor Lamont and the Connecticut delegation to announce more than $11 million in federal infrastructure funding to expand passenger rail service along the Hartford Line,”  said Larson.  “Over a decade ago, our state and delegation secured the first federal funding to build the Hartford Line. Now, it is serving 600,000 riders annually. Today’s funding is another example of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law connecting our region and expanding transit options for residents and commuters alike. We will continue to work together to create good-paying jobs and make affordable, reliable transit more accessible for all along our ‘Knowledge Corridor.’” 

“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help Connecticut get to an economy with more jobs and higher wages to deal with the cost of living,”  said DeLauro.  “Today’s announcement of $11.6 million for the Hartford Line is just one more example of the benefits of federal, state, and local collaboration on transportation projects. Totaling $300 million so far from BIL, these rail investments will expand services from Hartford south to New Haven and north to Windsor Locks and Springfield, supporting our transit-oriented development goals and connecting people with jobs while bolstering our local economies.” 

“With a stop in Meriden, the Hartford Line provides accessible transit options for people living in the Fifth District and those traveling across Connecticut,”  said Hayes.  “The Federal Railroad Administration funding announced today will continue to expand rail services and connect more travelers to safe, reliable public transit. I am thrilled to see yet another investment for our state made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.” 

“The Hartford Line is not only providing a valuable and convenient public transit resource for people who live in central Connecticut, but it is also helping create new opportunities for economic growth and development in the towns it serves,”  said Lamont.  “Expanding service on this line will further make travel on this rail line even more convenient, and I appreciate President Biden and the FRA for partnering with our state to make this happen.” 

The overall $25 million project will increase service and reliability across the entire Hartford Line, including the rail stations in New Haven, Hartford, Windsor Locks, and Springfield, Massachusetts. 

In total, the CT  rail  Hartford Line Expanded Enhancement Project will: 

  * Add one weekday round trip from New Haven to Hartford, addressing a midday service gap of up to three hours. 
  * Increase customer service hours at Hartford Union Station by 75%. 
  * Extend the weekend 6456, 6457, 6458, and 6459 trains to Windsor Locks station. 
  * Extend the weekday 4401 train from Windsor Locks to Springfield. 
  * Continue previous 2020 funding for the addition of two weekdays trains between New Haven and Springfield. 
  * Enhance connectivity of the existing rail service along the Northeast Corridor. 



Since its inception in 2018, the CT  rail  Hartford Line has grown significantly, spurring economic development and investments throughout the corridor. More than 750,000 passenger trips were expected in 2024, the highest ridership year since the service began. 

By 2030, the CT  rail  Hartford Line Expanded Enhancement Project is projected to increase ridership by about 90,000, and saving motorists more than 100 million miles traveled, over 3.5 million gallons of fuel annually, and over 25,000 metric tons of reduced carbon emissions per year.

11:02:54 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:02:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) is applauding the newly  released report  from the United States Trade Representative outlining how China has used unfair trade practices to undercut American shipbuilding, hurting American workers, businesses, and national security. Senator Baldwin called on the administration to fight China’s unfair trade practices, leading her colleagues  in support  of the United Steelworkers’ (USW)  effort  to have United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai initiate a full investigation into China’s maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Today’s report – which lays out China’s unfair, targeted efforts to dominate the shipbuilding and maritime industry – paves the way for the incoming administration to implement remedies and level the playing field. 

“Wisconsin workers carry on a proud tradition of building the world-class ships that protect our nation at home and abroad. This report shows what I knew all along: China has been undercutting these hardworking men and women and cheating the system, threatening an industry that is critical to our economy and keeping Americans safe,”  said Senator Baldwin.  “Looking ahead to the next administration, I’m calling on President-elect Trump to crack down on these cheaters, level the playing field for American workers, and safeguard our national defense by supporting Made in America shipbuilding.” 

The report released today by the USTR found that China targeted the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance, concluding that the PRC’s targeted dominance in these sectors is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce, and is therefore “actionable” under Section 301. The report lays out China’s efforts to target the shipbuilding and maritime industry for dominance – using state-sponsored financial support to elevate their own industry, imposing barriers for foreign firms, and stealing intellectual property to give China’s shipbuilding and maritime industry an advantage. According to the report, China also severely and artificially suppressed labor costs in the maritime, shipbuilding, and logistics sectors, undercutting American workers. 

Senator Baldwin has been leading the charge to level the playing field for Wisconsin workers. In March, Senator Baldwin joined USW and other labor leaders for a  press conference  in support of the American shipbuilding industry and to  call on  Trade Representative Tai to conduct a full investigation. In April, the USTR announced they were heeding that call and  launching  an investigation into China, resulting in today’s report that lays the groundwork for the Trump Administration to impose appropriate penalties on China to support American workers. 

Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost industrial shipbuilding capacity while China’s subsidized shipbuilding has only grown. State-owned enterprises and other facilities in China are now capable of producing over 1,000 ocean-going vessels a year, while the United States currently produces fewer than ten. While shipbuilding capacity, suppliers, and shipyards remain vital to the U.S. economy and national security, China’s uncompetitive trade practices have led to 25,000 domestic shipbuilding suppliers leaving the U.S. market over the past 20 years. 

“The USTR’s comprehensive investigation of Chinese trade practices exposed a slate of tactics designed to dominate and control the maritime, shipbuilding and logistics sectors,”  said USW International President David McCall.  “We’re grateful for Sen. Tammy Baldwin and our other congressional allies who helped advance this vital work. Now, we have the chance to hold China accountable, rebuild our domestic shipbuilding sector and create good, community-sustaining jobs across the supply chain.” 

“As a shipbuilder by trade, I’ve seen firsthand how China’s unfair trade practices have decimated the U.S. shipbuilding and maritime industry,”  said International Association of Machinists Union International President Brian Bryant.  “It is well past time to take swift and bold action to restore U.S. shipbuilding to a position of strength. As the largest shipbuilding union, the IAM stands ready to work with all partners in this fight to protect our national security, reinvigorate this critical industry, and defend the dedicated and skilled American workers who build these vessels for our military, commercial industry and more.” 

Senator Baldwin has long championed Buy America policies to support American businesses and workers. She fought to advance her  American Made Navy Act  in last year’s annual defense legislation, which would ensure by 2033 any new Navy ship purchased uses 100% domestically produced materials, like propulsion systems, shipboard components, couplings, shafts, support bearings, and more. She also worked to  include  strong Buy America standards in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

“Today, I met with RFK, Jr. because Wisconsinites expect that I give all the incoming President’s nominees a fair shake. Unfortunately, I left the conversation more concerned than when I walked in, and he did nothing to ease my grave concerns about his long list of conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine positions. His previous statements that ‘there is no vaccine that is safe and effective’ or that he is going to fire 600 scientists who are working to find cures to diseases like cancer are not only wrong, but if this guy gets into power, it will be downright dangerous for Wisconsin families. 

“Wisconsin parents don’t want their kindergarteners coming home with mumps or measles. Wisconsin families don’t want cancer and Alzheimer’s to keep taking our loved ones. Wisconsin women don’t want RFK, Jr. stopping them from getting birth control at the pharmacy. Wisconsinites don’t want higher health care costs and more garbage insurance plans that don’t cover the things they need. But, this could be our reality with RFK, Jr. leading our nation’s leading health agency. 

“Wisconsinites deserve someone who is fighting to keep them safe and healthy, not someone fighting to push vaccine conspiracy theories and stop research on cures to deadly diseases.”

11:02:57 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:02:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) announced that she successfully pushed the Biden administration to fully implement stronger Buy America standards for federally funded highway projects to support domestic manufacturing and create good-paying jobs. For years, Senator Baldwin has called for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to end the 40-year policy that has allowed the federal government to skirt Buy America rules when constructing highways. This week, the FHWA announced a final rule to end the longstanding waiver that allowed federal-aid highway projects to sidestep Buy America rules and put in place stronger requirements that support American manufacturing. 

“To me, it’s always been simple: when we use taxpayer dollars to build things, we should use those dollars to invest in American businesses, American jobs, and American workers,”  said Senator Baldwin.  “I have long fought to ensure that when we rebuild our roads, we Buy America, and I am proud to bring home this win. In his first administration, President Trump and I found common ground on Buy America policies – and I fully expect that he will continue to support these requirements that are a win for Wisconsin workers and manufacturers.” 

“We are grateful for Senator Baldwin’s tireless work to end the Buy America waiver for manufactured products. Since 1983, tax dollars spent on infrastructure projects have been used to purchase imported products rather than those made here in America by U.S. companies and their workers,”  said Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul.  “This egregious loophole has been a colossal, missed opportunity to strengthen supply chains and build a stronger, more resilient economy. It is time to close this loophole without any further delay.” 

Senator Baldwin has led the charge in advocating for stronger Buy American standards to prioritize American workers and products when U.S. taxpayer dollars are used. In May of 2023, Senator Baldwin  called on FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt  to end its 40-year Buy America waiver and “begin the long overdue process of developing FHWA’s guidelines for the purchase of American-made manufactured products in Federal-aid highway projects.” 

In January 2021, Senator Baldwin  pushed Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg  at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee to commit to changing or rescinding the blanket waiver that has made foreign manufactured products eligible for FHWA projects. 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will provide approximately  $350 billion  for Federal highway programs over a five-year period. Senator Baldwin successfully included key provisions of her  Made in America Act  and  Build America, Buy America Act  in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to boost the use of American-made goods in infrastructure projects, including ensuring that this 40-year old waiver be reviewed. Combined, these two provisions will ensure that many common construction materials, like iron, steel, plastic, concrete, glass, and others, used in construction products are from the United States when rebuilding many parts of our infrastructure.

11:02:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) announced she helped deliver a $7 million investment to expand affordable housing in Dane County. The federal investment, which Senator Baldwin supported in annual funding legislation for 2024, will help build nearly 50 affordable homes, help address zoning and building codes, engage with new developers, and support infrastructure and affordable multi-family rental development. 

“In almost every community in Wisconsin I visit, I hear from hard-working families who are struggling to find housing in their budget, and I’m committed to being part of the solution to boost the housing stock and bring down costs across the Badger State,”  said Senator Baldwin.  “This investment for Dane County will help build nearly 50 homes for Wisconsin families, remove barriers and lay the groundwork for future affordable housing development so more families can live in the communities they love.” 

The federal funding will be used to help build 47 new affordable housing units. The investment will remove barriers to affordable housing by implementing a countywide strategy to address municipal building codes that restrict affordable and multi-family unit housing. The funding will also go towards supporting nonprofit and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) developers – who historically struggle with access to capital – therefore building capacity for future affordable housing development. 

"I want to extend my gratitude to Senator Tammy Baldwin for her commitment to ensuring Dane County remains a place where everyone has access to safe, affordable housing. Senator Baldwin’s efforts in helping secure the federal resources needed to empower Dane County’s Housing Access and Affordability team will have generational impacts,”  said Dane County Executive Melissa Agard.  “This funding will equip our team with the tools necessary to collaborate with local governments in removing barriers to housing while expanding capacity for affordable and inclusive development.” 

The investment comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing), which empowers communities to remove barriers to affordable housing – including restrictive zoning designations, land use policies, or regulations; deteriorating or inadequate infrastructure; or challenges to preserving existing housing stock such as increasing threats from natural hazards, redevelopment that reduces the number of affordable units, displacement pressures, or expiration of affordability requirements.

11:02:59 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:02:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C  . – U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced their  Health Care Affordability Act  —legislation to make permanent the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits (PTCs) for Marketplace coverage, which would prevent millions of Americans’ health care costs from increasing at the end of 2025. In Wisconsin,  231,000 Wisconsinites  –  over 85%  of ACA Marketplace enrollees – saved  $573 each month on average  with these enhanced tax credits in 2024. If these tax credits expire at the end of this year, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites will face significantly higher premium costs, with an  estimated  30,000 Wisconsinites losing health insurance. 

“Every Wisconsinite should be able to get the health care they need. Period. Our Affordable Care Act put health care within reach for millions of Americans who could for the first time afford and access the comprehensive care they need to stay healthy, but there’s more work to do,”  said Senator Baldwin.  “I’m looking at every way we can further lower costs and expand access to good health care for families – and that starts with not jacking up costs on Wisconsinites. If we don’t make these tax breaks permanent, thousands of working families will see their health care bills skyrocket, potentially leaving some without the lifesaving care they need.” 

Nationally, an average enrollee  saved an estimated $700 in 2024  because of the PTC enhancements, with average monthly premiums over 32 percent lower than in 2021, before the enhancements took effect. According to the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  , if the PTCs are allowed to expire at the end of this year, health care premiums would increase by 7.9 percent and 3.8 million Americans would lose their health insurance altogether. 

Last week, the Biden Administration  announced  that with a week left to go in the 2025 enrollment period, nearly 24 million consumers – including a record-breaking  306,470 Wisconsinites  – have signed up for ACA Marketplace coverage. This year’s open enrollment period ends on January 15, 2025. 

The  Health Care Affordability Act  would make permanent the ACA PTCs for Health Insurance Marketplace coverage as passed in the  American Rescue Plan Act  and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which Senator Baldwin supported. Those enhanced tax credits increase the value of the tax credits available to people with income between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) while expanding eligibility for premium tax credits to include individuals with income above 400 percent of FPL.

11:03:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.--  At the nomination hearing of Scott Bessent to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) praised Mr. Bessent’s exceptional qualifications to lead the agency and reaffirmed his commitment for a swift confirmation. 

At the conclusion of the hearing,  Crapo  said  , “When it comes to your qualifications to be the next Secretary of the Treasury, there’s no room for debate. Your background and training are tailor made for this role, and your character and demeanor are self-evident. You have satisfied our due diligence process. In prior congresses, I have joined with many of my Republican colleagues in voting for well-qualified Treasury Secretary candidates put forward by a Democrat president, even though I didn’t agree with all the positions for which they advocated. Your candidacy ought to enjoy similar support, and I’m going to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in advancing your nomination.” 

Chairman Crapo also underscored the critical need to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to avert a devastating tax hike of more than $4 trillion that would disproportionately hit lower- and middle-income Americans. Echoing Senator Crapo’s concerns, Mr. Bessent praised the TCJA's role in driving economic growth, calling its extension “the single most important economic issue of the day.”

Crapo and Bessent on the importance of preventing a more-than $4 trillion tax hike on working-class Americans: 

Crapo countered a mischaracterization of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which is current law, as being a “tax cut for the wealthy:” 

I appreciate you, Mr. Bessent, for noting that there will be a more than $4 trillion dollar tax increase if we do not extend this law. And a point that I would remind all of my colleagues is if that more than $4 trillion dollar tax increase happens, it's not just going to be something that impacts the wealthy. $2.6 trillion of it, the majority of it, falls on people who make less than $400,000. That's the number that President Biden chose to say he wanted to protect. $2.6 trillion of this tax [increase] hits those making less than $400,000. . .  This is not a tax cut for the wealthy that we're talking about, it is a tax increase on all Americans, the majority of whom are in the lower- and middle-income categories. 

Bessent: 

This is the single most important economic issue of the day. This is pass / fail. But if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity, and as always, with financial instability, that falls on the middle- and working-class people.  We will see a gigantic middle class tax increase. We will see the child tax credit halve. We will see the deductions halve. So—it will be what we call in economics—it has the potential for a sudden stop. And as I said, traditionally, with these sudden stops, it falls among working Americans. 

Crapo: 

It seems to me that as we are talking about what to do for America, that protecting America from a 1 percent reduction versus a 1 percent growth in GDP is a critical objective.  Could you just give a little bit of perspective? 

Bessent: 

Senator, I will just say that we saw the power of these tax cuts in 2018, 2019 and going into January of 2020 before they were interrupted by COVID-19, and the great success that we had.

11:03:02 root         DEBUG    Titles: Crapo, Wyden, Bipartisan Senators Call on President Biden to Stop Rushing Trade Negotiations Behind Closed Doors
11:03:02 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:02 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  \--U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) led a bipartisan group of senators calling on the Biden Administration to direct United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to cease secret negotiations with foreign trading partners. The USTR is attempting to change at least three major trade agreements in secret, while simultaneously sacrificing valuable leverage that the USTR could use to win concessions from trading partners that would benefit Americans. 

USTR is seeking changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) by the end of the presidential term. 

“Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation,”  the senators wrote  . “USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies.” 

The senators warned that making concessions to trading partners would sacrifice leverage to make progress on a number of U.S. priorities. In USMCA negotiations, for example, USTR should use any available leverage to address Mexico’s restrictions on U.S. corn and energy, as well as Canada’s unfair dairy policies and taxes on digital services. USTR should also push to resolve the United States’ many outstanding concerns with Colombia, including labor standards and workers’ rights, corn and dairy market access and auto regulations. 

The senators continued  , “Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred.” 

Crapo and Wyden have repeatedly called on USTR to make trade agreements more transparent by working closely with Congress. 

  * In January 2022, Crapo and Wyden  called  on the Biden administration to enforce USMCA and hold Canada and Mexico to their commitments that were intended to benefit American workers, farmers and businesses. 
  * In May 2022, Crapo and Wyden  made clear  that Ambassador Tai was failing to abide by the Administration’s own transparency guidelines. 
  * In November 2023, Crapo and Wyden  called  on the White House to engage in comprehensive consultations to ensure that U.S. digital trade policy combats the repressive policies of Russia and China and promotes open markets for digital goods exported by American creators and businesses. 



Chairman Crapo strongly opposes any attempt by the Biden Administration to unreasonably tie the incoming Trump Administration or Republican Congress’s hands on trade policy. 

In addition to Crapo and Wyden, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Katie Britt (R-Alabama), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), Todd Young (R-Indiana), Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada), Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), Alex Padilla (D-California) and Mark Warner (D-Virginia).

11:03:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.--  U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) delivered the following remarks at a hearing to consider the nomination of Scott Bessent to be Secretary of the Treasury. 

As prepared for delivery: 

“Before we begin, let me extend a welcome to our new Finance Committee Members: Senators Marshall, Luján, Sanders, Smith, Warnock and Welch. They bring expertise that will serve the Committee well. 

“I am honored to lead this Committee alongside Ranking Member Wyden. 

“We have a proven track record of working together to improve the lives of our constituents in the Pacific Northwest and America writ large. We can—and will—do so again in this Congress. 

“This Committee’s jurisdiction—tax, trade and health care policy—reflects some of the most challenging matters that Congress confronts. 

“The Finance Committee will continue its long tradition of addressing these matters in a manner that invites bipartisanship and delivers results to create opportunities for Americans. 

“Turning to today’s hearing, let me extend a warm welcome to Mr. Scott Bessent, President Trump’s nominee for the Secretary of the Treasury, as well as his family. 

“Congratulations, Mr. Bessent, on your well-deserved nomination, and thank you for your willingness to serve and for your extensive cooperation with the Committee. 

“It has already been a great pleasure to work with you. You have been transparent, candid and insightful with me and my colleagues. 

“You have spent countless hours meaningfully answering our questions and accorded yourself with great courtesy, dignity and professionalism. 

“Throughout the Committee’s rigorous vetting process, you have worked tirelessly to meet our longstanding diligence standard. 

“It is clear that you followed applicable law and provided thousands of pages of documentation that substantiate your positions—positions supported by major law and accounting firms. 

“Thank you for your transparency and responsiveness throughout the Finance Committee’s exacting process. I look forward to continuing to work together. 

“Mr. Bessent has worked for the last three decades as one of the sharpest minds in the global finance industry, including as an entrepreneur who started his own asset management firm. 

“He taught economic history at Yale University, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, has served on the board of universities and non-profits and engages in a variety of philanthropic endeavors. 

“Mr. Bessent, based upon your background, experience and character, President Trump made an excellent choice in nominating you to be a Secretary of the Treasury. 

“As you have described it, the position for which you are nominated is at the heart of the American economy, which in turn is the heart of global economic growth. 

“A Treasury Secretary heads the agency charged with supporting economic growth, representing U.S. interests before foreign nations and global financial markets and organizations, managing the federal treasury, and overseeing financial institutions, to name a few responsibilities. 

“Past successful Treasury Secretaries have understood business and financial markets, as well as foreign policy, national security, budgets and regulation. 

“They have worked collaboratively with Congress to enact the President’s policy priorities. 

“Additionally, they have been forthright and communicative. 

“The next Treasury Secretary will have to work with Congress to preserve and build on pro-growth Republican tax policies that have greatly benefitted all Americans, as well as improve our global competitiveness through trade deals that create market access and combat China’s unfair practices. 

“As seen in the results of our most recent election, American voters resoundingly support a return to the robust economy we enjoyed during President Trump’s first term. 

“If you are confirmed, I look forward to working closely with you to achieve these and other essential aims. 

“Mr. Bessent, on behalf of my colleagues, I thank you for your willingness to serve and again congratulate you on your nomination, which I intend to support. 

“With that, I recognize Ranking Member Wyden for his opening remarks.”

11:03:03 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.--  U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) joined Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) to introduce  legislation  to prevent the World Health Organization (WHO) from repeating past pandemic failures at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. 

The Defending American Sovereignty in Global Pandemics Act would mandate Senate approval for the U.S. to enter any WHO agreements related to pandemic prevention or response and suspends funding for the WHO until such agreements are ratified. 

“Protecting Americans’ individual freedoms and liberties must remain paramount.”  Crapo said  . “The WHO’s poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic has left lasting negative impacts on our economy. The United States should not give up its sovereignty to global bodies without congressional approval.” 

“We cannot allow the World Health Organization (WHO) to spend American tax dollars on another failed pandemic response,”  said Senator Barrasso  . “Its blatant partisanship and incompetence during COVID-19 was inexcusable. The mishandling of the pandemic has caused lasting damage to our country’s health and economy. Any pandemic-related WHO agreements must receive Senate approval before using the hard-earned money of American taxpayers.” 

This bill stops the U.S. from entering any international agreement, convention or instrument under the WHO related to pandemic prevention or response without ratification by the United States Senate. Additionally, the WHO would be prohibited from spending U.S. funds on such agreements until it is ratified by the Senate. 

Co-sponsors of this legislation include U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee).

11:03:04 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.--  U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), John Boozman (R-Arkansas) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced the  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  . This legislation would allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any state that permits concealed carry, while following that state’s laws. 

"Idahoans and Americans nationwide should not be deprived of their fundamental right to self-defense,”  said Crapo.  “Ensuring concealed carry reciprocity would enable law-abiding citizens to uphold this right while traveling or residing temporarily outside their home state." 

“Allowing Idaho’s law-abiding gun owners to travel from state to state with their valid concealed carry permit is commonsense,”  said Risch.  “The  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  honors Americans’ right to bear arms and recognizes the authority of the States.” 

“I am proud to support Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms,”  said Boozman  . “This legislation is a commonsense solution to protect concealed carry privilege across all 50 states and uphold the rights of lawful, responsible gun owners.” 

“The Lone Star State has long championed our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and gun owners in Texas and across the country should not have that fundamental right violated when they cross state lines,”  said Cornyn.  “This legislation would reduce unnecessary burdens for law-abiding citizens and allow them to carry a concealed firearm in every state that permits it and I’m grateful for the overwhelming support from my fellow Republican colleagues on this commonsense bill.” 

The  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  : 

  * Would allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any state with concealed carry laws; 
  * Would treat state-issued concealed carry permits like driver’s licenses where an individual can use their home-state license to drive in another state, but must abide by that other state’s speed limit or road laws; and 
  * Would protect state sovereignty by not establishing a national standard for concealed carry. 



This legislation is endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and Gun Owners of America (GOA). 

The legislation is also co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and Senators Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kansas), Rick Scott (R-Florida), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Katie Britt (R-Alabama), Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-Louisiana), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Ted Budd (R-North Carolina), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), Tim Sheehy (R-Montana), John Kennedy (R-Lousiana), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Eric Schmitt (R-Missouri), Todd Young (R-Indiana), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), Jim Banks (R-Indiana), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), John Curtis (R-Utah), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

11:03:07 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:03:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas-19) introduced legislation to repeal an Executive Order issued by President Biden on January 6, 2025 that banned American energy exploration on over 625 million acres of offshore territory. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “President Biden’s ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling is an attack on American energy independence, jobs, and national security. His action is a gift to our adversaries and once again confirms that this President has failed to protect the livelihood of American energy workers. I am introducing legislation to overturn this executive action. Under President Trump, we achieved energy dominance and I am committed to leading the fight to restore it and protect Texas jobs.” 

Rep. Arrington said,  “In the final hours of his presidency, President Biden finished off four years of self-inflicted disasters by continuing his all-out assault on domestic energy production. Banning oil and gas production on millions of acres of offshore waters takes direct aim at American energy producers, threatening national security, and empowering adversaries like Russia, all just to take one last bow for the woke and climate obsessed mob. Senator Cruz and I are fighting to repeal this dangerous policy, unleash American energy, and ensure a clear path for President Trump's America First agenda on day one.” 

Oil & Gas Workers Association (OGWA), President & Founder, Matt Coday said,  “Producing all our nation's vast natural resources creates millions of good-paying USA jobs and lowers gas, grocery, and utility costs for every American. Joe Biden's ban on Outer Continental Shelf drilling hurts our jobs, hurts every American, and funds terrorists. USA oil and natural gas exports help free our friends and allies around the world from dependence on Russia, China, and Iran. We are grateful Senator Cruz and Representative Arrington are leading the fight to overturn the Biden ban and ensure we achieve American energy dominance under President Trump.” 

EnerGeo, Vice President of Global Policy & Government Affairs, Dustin Van Liew said,  “We applaud Chairman Cruz’s leadership introducing the Overturn Biden's Offshore Energy Ban Act to reverse a short-sighted, political, and harmful decision by the outgoing Administration to ban vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf from future exploration, undermining America's ability to meet its future energy needs. It is essential to recognize that increased exploration of natural gas and petroleum is required to maintain a stable and balanced energy mix for the country. The Gulf of Mexico, in particular, plays a crucial role in America’s energy production and is a critical source of supply for global allies, and restricting access to these resources could harm?the nation’s?energy security and economic stability. Continued exploration and innovation are crucial for addressing both environmental and energy demands in a way that ensures long-term sustainability and balance.”? 

American Petroleum Institute (API), Vice President of Upstream Policy, Holly Hopkins  said,  “Our nation’s vast offshore resources are a critical source of affordable energy, government revenue and stability around the world. We welcome the efforts of Sen. Cruz along with those of Rep. Arrington to reverse the Biden administration’s disastrous 11th hour decision to ban new oil and natural gas activity across millions of acres of federal waters.” 

National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), President, Erik Milito said,  “NOIA applauds Senator Cruz and Congressman Arrington for their efforts to repeal the Biden Administration’s politically driven offshore oil and gas ban. By lifting these restrictions, Congress restores the nation’s ability to leverage its offshore energy resources, strengthening the economy and protecting our national security. The Overturn Biden’s Offshore Energy Ban Act will drive confidence in U.S. investment and energy policy, rather than our adversaries’, ensure adaptability to geopolitical changes, and protect American interests. This bill is a prime example of the long-term, strategic approach to energy policy the U.S. needs.”

BACKGROUND 

On January 6, 2025, President Biden announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of federal waters, including the East and West Coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and parts of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea. The administration cited environmental, health, and economic risks, highlighting opposition from over 2,300 officials and coastal communities. 

A coalition of energy organizations agree the ban undermines domestic energy production, job creation, and national security.

11:03:08 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), joined by Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D), introduced the  No Tax on Tips Act  to exempt tips from being subject to taxation under the federal income tax. Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.-16) was joined by Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.-19) in introducing the companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “American workers in many industries rely on tipped wages to make ends meet. Today, I’m introducing my bipartisan No Tax on Tips Act—legislation I authored to fulfill President Trump’s promise to end the wrongful practice of taxing voluntary tips. I’ve long believed the GOP should be the party of bartenders, of waiters and waitresses, and this bill is an important step to ensure we are addressing the economic needs of working Americans. This pro-worker bill will deliver relief to families facing rising costs caused by the Biden administration’s inflationary policies.” 

Sen. Rosen said,  “Nevada’s service and hospitality workers are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve financial relief at a time when they are getting squeezed by rising costs. This bipartisan bill will ensure tipped workers in Nevada can keep more of their hard-earned money. I’ll also keep fighting to raise the minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage for service employees, lower costs, and cut taxes for all hardworking Nevadans.” 

Sen. Cortez Masto said,  “Working families in Nevada deserve a break, and this bipartisan bill will put more money in their pockets. This is one part of my comprehensive work to lower costs for working families and deliver for Nevadans across the state.” 

Sen. Daines said,  “Hard-working Montanans have been hit hard with Biden’s inflation, and by making tips tax-free we’re delivering on President Trump’s promise to lower taxes and bring back American prosperity. ‘No Tax on Tips’ will bolster the workforce and I’m looking forward to working with President Trump on more ways to unleash our economy.” 

Sen. Rick Scott said,  “During my time as Governor of Florida, I worked to cut taxes over 100 times to help businesses thrive, families keep more of their hard-earned dollars and turn our entire economy around. After four years of President Biden’s skyrocketing inflation making life harder for families, it’s about time we follow Florida’s turnaround playbook and take significant action to cut taxes with the No Tax on Tips Act. President Trump is laser-focused on getting our economy back on track, and passing this bill ASAP will be a great start.” 

Rep. Buchanan said,  “Florida’s tourism-driven economy thrives because of the hardworking men and women in our restaurant and hospitality industries, many of whom rely on tipped wages to support their families. I’m introducing the No Tax on Tips Act with Congressman Donalds to ensure that these essential workers are able to keep more of the money they’ve earned, without interference from Washington. As Vice Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and a former chairman of the Tax Subcommittee, cutting taxes for working Americans is my top priority.” 

Rep. Donalds said,  “For far-too-long, Washington’s focus has been on how much of your paycheck politicians and unelected bureaucrats will take to fund their destructive agendas. Americans deserve to take home more of what they have earned, especially given the self-inflicted economic hardships created by the Biden administration. I am proud to have introduced the ‘No Tax on Tips Act’ last Congress alongside Senator Cruz (R-TX) and look forward to its swift passage in the 119th Congress. Hardworking Americans across our Southwest Florida community, the Sunshine State, and the nation deserve a government that will put them first.” 

National Restaurant Association, Executive Vice President for Public Affairs, Sean Kennedy said,  “Eliminating taxes on tips would put cash back in the pocket of a significant number of workers in the restaurant and foodservice industry and could help restaurant operators recruit industry workforce. The No Tax on Tips Act of 2025is sensible legislation that includes refinements and protections to make it fiscally responsible while still benefiting our employees. We appreciate Sen. Cruz’s efforts to refine his legislation, and look forward to working with him on this and other legislation to support restaurant vitality in Texas and across the country.” 

Professional Beauty Association, Executive Director, Nina Daily said,  “We thank Senator Ted Cruz and his team for acknowledging the contributions of beauty and barber professionals, as well as small business owners in our industry. As the second most-tipped sector after restaurants, we deeply value the Senator’s efforts to support the 1.3 million licensed beauty professionals and the employers who sustain this vital industry across the United States. Ensuring tax fairness across sectors and advocating for the working class are fundamental to our nation’s tax principles. We look forward to working together to turn this legislation into a meaningful reality for the hardworking individuals and businesses that make up our Main Street economy.” 

International Franchise Association, Chief Advocacy Officer, Michael Layman said,  “  We commend Senator Cruz for re-introducing this balanced ‘No Tax On Tips’ proposal that helps workers and small business owners alike. Many of the 830,000 franchises and nine million workers we represent will benefit from this federal payroll tax credit. We appreciate this effort to bring parity across industries with tipped employees and level the playing field for small businesses on Main Street nationwide.” 

BACKGROUND: 

The bill exempts “cash tips”—cash, credit and debit card charges, and checks—from federal income tax by allowing taxpayers to claim a 100% deduction at filing for tipped wages. The updated text includes guardrails to ensure only traditionally tipped employees will benefit from  No Tax on Tips.

Sen. Cruz has consistently prioritized making sure American taxpayers keep their hard-earned income and Texans have access to jobs: 

  * Sen. Cruz helped enact historic  tax reform  in 2017, which gave a tax cut to virtually every taxpayer in America. It reduced taxes on small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and job producers, which has helped bring jobs to Texas. 


  * He has  fought  to make permanent the 2017 historic tax cuts for individuals. 


  * Sen. Cruz also helped pass the  USMCA trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump  , a decisive victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, businesses, and manufacturers. 


  * For his efforts to support Texas businesses large and small, Sen. Cruz  received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s prestigious “Spirit of Enterprise” award  .

11:03:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced legislation today to repeal the Biden administration’s Natural Gas Tax in the Inflation Reduction Act. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “  Democratic policies have forced Americans to endure historic inflation and economic pain, and have jeopardized American energy independence and national security. It’s time to unleash American energy. The 2024 election was a mandate for new policies. My legislation eliminates what would be a crippling tax. I urge my colleagues to expeditiously take up and pass my legislation.” 

Sen. Marshall said,  “The Democrats' relentless attacks on American energy have killed good paying jobs, ceded power to foreign nations, and caused energy bills to skyrocket. Fortunately, in a few short days, President Trump will right the wrongs of the Biden Administration’s failed energy policies. We will unleash American energy and ensure Americans can power their communities into the future.” 

Sen. Tuberville said,  “The Biden administration has once again prioritized woke climate activists over the American people. Since day one in office, Joe Biden has waged war on American energy – driving up costs and sending American jobs overseas. The last thing Americans need right now are higher taxes and more government red tape. I am proud to join this legislation, which puts American families first and works toward American energy independence.” 

Sen. Britt said,  “The American people voted resoundingly in November for an America-first approach to energy policy. Repealing the Natural Gas Tax is an important step towards ensuring affordable, reliable energy for all. I look forward to working with the incoming Trump Administration and his strong cabinet to reestablish American energy independence and dominance, starting with eliminating these costly fees driving up our energy prices.” 

American Energy Institute, CEO, Hon. Jason Isaac said,  “The Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act is a vital step toward reducing energy costs for American consumers and eliminating an unnecessary tax on the key to ending poverty. By removing this burden, we empower American energy producers—the most responsible on the planet—to deliver affordable, reliable energy that fuels economic growth, lifts millions out of poverty, and strengthens our national security.” 

Sen. Cruz introduced the legislation with Sens. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), and Katie Britt (R-Ala.).

11:03:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced the Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2025. The legislation provides remedies for military servicemembers harmed by the Department of Defense’s (DOD) COVID-19 vaccine mandate. It is language from legislation Cruz previously introduced to repeal DOD’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “Our military is still dealing with the consequences of the Biden administration’s wrongful COVID-19 vaccine mandate. I led the successful charge for Congress to repeal that mandate, and there is still more to be done. My AMERICANS Act provides remedies for servicemembers punished by the Biden Department of Defense for standing by their convictions.” 

Rep. Harrigan said,  “The Biden Administration’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate wasn’t about science or readiness—it was about control. It was a betrayal of our service members, punishing thousands of patriots for standing by their values and weakening our military at a time of global uncertainty. Over 8,400 men and women were discharged, their benefits stripped, their careers ruined—not because they failed to serve with honor, but because of a political overreach that had no place in our armed forces. As a Green Beret, I’ve seen the sacrifices our service members make firsthand, and I will not stand by while their honor is tarnished. The AMERICANS Act does what this administration refused to: it restores justice. It reinstates the careers and benefits of those wrongfully discharged, clears their records of political retribution, and ensures they are treated with the dignity they’ve earned. This bill guarantees that no administration, now or in the future, can weaponize mandates to sideline those who protect our freedom.” 

Sen. Cruz was joined by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.) in introducing the legislation. 

Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.-10) is leading a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.

BACKGROUND 

Sen. Cruz’s AMERICANS Act of 2025 would require the DOD to:   
  


  * Offer reinstatement to any servicemember separated solely for COVID-19 vaccine status, crediting such service member with the time of involuntary separation for retirement pay calculations; 


  * Restore the rank of any servicemember demoted solely for COVID-19 vaccine status and compensate them for any pay and benefits lost as a result of that demotion; 


  * Adjust to “honorable” any “general” discharge given to a service member due solely to COVID-19 vaccine status; 


  * Make servicemembers whole for any bonuses they were forced to repay or did not receive based solely on their COVID-19 vaccine status. 


  * Expunge from a servicemember’s record any adverse action based solely on COVID-19 vaccine status, regardless of whether or not such service member previously sought an accommodation; 


  * Make every effort to retain servicemembers not vaccinated against COVID-19, providing them with professional development, promotion, and leadership opportunities equal to that of their peers; and 


  * Provide a COVID-19 vaccine exemption process for servicemembers with natural immunity, a relevant underlying health condition, or a sincerely held religious belief inconsistent with being vaccinated.

They push these policies both because they believe in them and to undermine the incoming Trump administration and Republican Congress. These moves do incredible damage to American national security and send a message to our adversaries that they can rely on outgoing Democrat administrations – and wait out pressure from Republican administrations – to continue engaging in terrorism and other aggression against Americans. 

“Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits. The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.”

11:03:11 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:03:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.-16) introduced the  Thin Blue Line Act  to increase penalties for criminals who target law enforcement. Federal law already makes the targeting, killing, or attempted killing of federal law enforcement officers, judges, and correctional officers, an aggravating factor in the decision whether to impose the federal death penalty. The  Thin Blue Line Act  would expand this list to include state and local police, firefighters, and other first responders. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “Violent crimes targeting law enforcement demand immediate action. These crimes should never be tolerated. Every day, members of law enforcement risk their lives to protect our communities and they deserve the full protection of the law. I am proud to introduce this common-sense legislation to ensure that acts of murder or attempted murder against law enforcement will be met with maximum penalties.” 

Rep. Buchanan said,  “Police officers and first responders risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe. After four years of an administration that prioritized protecting criminals and illegals over our brave men and women of law enforcement, it’s time to show that we have their backs. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, which previously passed the House with broad bipartisan support, and make it clear to would-be cop killers that if you target an officer, there will be severe consequences.” 

Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National President, Mathew Silverman  said,  “Our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers risk their lives daily to protect the citizens of this great nation. While they work tirelessly to safeguard our communities, their families remain at home, burdened with concern for their loved ones’ safety. In 2024, 144 law enforcement officers tragically lost their lives in the line of duty—heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety of others. The ‘Thin Blue Line Act’ seeks to strengthen penalties for those who target law enforcement officers, underscoring the gravity of crimes against those who serve in these vital roles. This legislation is a powerful statement of national support, honoring their dedication to justice and reinforcing the profound respect owed to their unwavering commitment to public safety.” 

National Sheriffs’ Association, President, Sheriff Kieran Donahue said,  “The Thin Blue Line Act is a vital step in ensuring those who target our public safety professionals face the full weight of justice. Law enforcement officers and first responders risk their lives daily to protect our communities, and this legislation sends a clear message that violence against them will not be tolerated. As sheriffs, we are committed to standing up for those who stand in harm's way to keep us safe.” 

United States Deputy Sheriff’s Association, Executive Director and National Trainer, David Hinners  said,  “The United States Deputy Sheriff’s Association is honored to support the Thin Blue Line Act. With the current atmosphere of anti-law enforcement in America this bill is a great step forward in supporting law enforcement and other first responders. These are the men and women who not only put their lives on the line every day but are dedicated to advancing their communities. The ThinBlue Line Act is a great way to support these heroes that go unnoticed every day.” 

Fraternal Order of Police, National President, Patrick Yoes said,  “Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on duty—it is nothing new. Although we go to work each day to protect others, over the last within the past few years, officers have become a target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear. It should not be “part of the job” to be a target for someone who is looking to simply kill or injure a cop. The ‘Thin Blue Line Act’ aims to reduce these attacks by expanding the list of aggravating factors in death penalty determinations for those who target, kill, or attempt to kill a law enforcement or other public safety officers, which sends a clear message to those who target, kill, or attempt to kill a law enforcement or other public safety officer that they will be held accountable and punished to the fullest extent of the law.” 

NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), President, Vincent Vallelong said,  “For too long, members of the NYPD and law enforcement officers across this nation have been subjected to targeted acts of violence as they work to protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear. While we know that these brave men and women will continue to face threats regardless of the uniform they wear, on duty or off, active or retired, the ‘Thin Blue Line Act’ sends the long-overdue message that any action to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence will be met with the harshest of penalties. The SBA is grateful for the continued leadership of Rep. Buchanan and Sen. Cruz on this important legislation.” 

Sen. Cruz was joined by Sens. John Kennedy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Hoven (R-N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.) in introducing the legislation. 

Rep. Buchanan introduced the companion legislation in the House of Representatives and was joined by Reps. Mike Ezell (R-Miss.-4), Troy Nehls (R-Texas-22), Clay Higgins (R-La.-3), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.-1), Randy Weber (R-Texas-14), Nick Lalota (R-N.Y.-1), Mike Bost (R-Ill.-12), Monica De La Cruz (R-Texas-15), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.-9), Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.-13), Richard Hudson (R-N.C.-9), Don Bacon (R-Neb.-2), and David Valadao (R-Ca.-22) in introducing the legislation.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reintroduced his legislation to designate the Iran-controlled Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The bill would also impose additional sanctions on the Houthis’s top three leaders, contingent upon the President’s determination of their affiliation with the group. The Biden administration removed the FTO designation from the Houthis in 2021. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “The Biden administration made a day one politically-driven decision to dismantle terrorism sanctions against the Houthis and their leaders. They knew the decision was unjustified, lied about portions of it on camera to the American people, and deliberately limited access to the full announcement. That decision was an obvious and catastrophic mistake from the very beginning, and contributed to enabling the Houthis to relaunch their assault on civilians in Yemen, to launch missiles at Israel and our Gulf allies, and over the last year to consistently attack commercial ships and American servicemembers in the Red Sea. The administration was unwilling to full reveres their day 1 decision. I believe that President Trump will reimpose those sanctions as part of restoring maximum pressure on the Iranian regime, and this bill ensures that the decision is backed and locked in by Congressional action.” 

The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).

BACKGROUND 

The Houthis, or Ansarallah, are an Iranian-backed Shia terrorist organization that currently control northwestern Yemen.In the final days of the Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated the Houthis as an FTO and an SDGT entity, which imposed sweeping sanctions on the terrorist group. Pompeo also designated three Houthi leaders – Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al Hakim – as SDGTs. 

However, in February 2021, Secretary Blinken revoked the FTO and SDGT designations. Lifting these designations and associated sanctions enabled the Houthis to receive financial and material support necessary to wage a military offensive against U.S. and allied assets in the region. Their capabilities have become increasingly sophisticated, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, suicide drones, and precision-guided weapons systems capable of reaching Israeli territory – capabilities that previous FTO sanctions could have helped suppress. 

While the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a SDGT entity in January 2024 in response to the Red Sea attacks, Secretary Blinken did not redesignate the group as an FTO. That designation would trigger far more effective sanctions that target third parties supplying the Houthis. Blinken also declined to re-designate the three Houthi leaders as SDGTs.

11:03:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas-22) introduced the Justice for Jocelyn Act. The bill enhances the detention and tracking of illegal aliens entering the United States. It was written in response to the brutal murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray by two illegal aliens in Houston, Texas last year. 

Upon introduction,  Sen. Cruz said,  “Last year, I began the fight for justice for 12-year-old Jocelyn. The aliens responsible for her murder crossed the southern border illegally and should have been detained by ICE. Democrats’ reckless open-border policies prevented ICE and Border Patrol agents from acting, left thousands of detention center beds empty, and allowed these criminals to go free. Congress should act with urgency to ensure no other American family ever has to endure what Jocelyn’s mother, Alexis Nungaray, has been forced to face. Standing alongside Alexis in this fight for justice has been an immense privilege, and I will not stop fighting until our communities are safe and justice is served.” 

Rep. Nehls said,  “I am proud to join my Texas colleague in the Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, in reintroducing the Justice for Jocelyn Act. Jocelyn Nungaray’s death was entirely preventable. The Justice for Jocelyn Act would improve the detention and tracking of illegal aliens released into the United States and would put the safety of the American people first. Congress, meaning the House and Senate, must immediately pass this legislation and get it to President Trump’s desk as soon as possible.”

Sen. Cruz was joined by Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in introducing the legislation. 

Rep. Nehls was joined by Reps. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas-38) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.-5) in introducing the legislation. 

BACKGROUND 

Sen. Cruz first  introduced  the Justice for Jocelyn Act in July of 2024. 

On June 17, 2024, two Venezuelan illegal aliens assaulted and brutally murdered 12-year-old Houston resident Jocelyn Nungaray. Both suspects were enrolled DHS’s “Alternative to Detention” (“ATD”) program. They were released into the interior of the United States despite the availability of thousands of ICE detention center beds. One of the suspects was wearing an ICE GPS monitor at the time of Jocelyn’s assault and murder. 

The Justice for Jocelyn Act would crack down on ATD by requiring every ICE detention bed to be filled, and, if filled, would require the Secretary of DHS to exhaust all reasonable efforts to keep an alien in custody. Should the Secretary nevertheless release an alien pursuant to ATD, the alien would be subject to continuous GPS monitoring until either their removal from the country or the completion of all immigration proceedings. Finally, Justice for Jocelyn would empower immigration officials to immediately deport illegal aliens who violate the terms of their release. 

In 2007, then-Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz argued before the United States Supreme Court in Medellín v. Texas, defending the right of the Texas courts to sentence a foreign national to death for the heinous rape and murder of two American teenage girls. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with Sen. Cruz, agreeing that the president could not usurp the authority of Congress and force Texas courts to abide by international rules that Congress had not been ratified. It was Sen. Cruz’s most notable win before the Supreme Court.

11:03:17 root         DEBUG    Titles: Schatz, Senators: Republican Tax Plan Will Help Billionaires By Ripping Off Working People
11:03:17 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:17 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) today joined Senate Democratic colleagues to highlight Republicans’ disastrous plan to cut taxes for billionaires by making enormous cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other critical assistance that everyday Americans rely on. Schatz underscored the wide range of cuts being proposed to pay for the tax bill, including nearly $500 billion from Medicare and $150 billion from Affordable Care Act funding. 

“After months of swearing up and down that they were focused on lowering the price of eggs, the price of groceries, the price of gas, the price of insurance, the very first thing that Donald Trump and the Republicans have decided to do is to cut taxes for billionaire corporations, and they're going to pay for it by ripping off working Americans,”  said Senator Schatz. 

Senator Schatz continued,  “They are literally cutting Medicare, Medicaid, possibly Social Security, and the Affordable Care Act. And they're going to take all these resources – these are their pay-fors – and shovel it to people so that they can continue their private jet subsidies, pay a lower tax rate, eliminate the 15 percent minimum billion-dollar corporation tax. I don't know anybody who thinks the solution to people paying too much out-of-pocket is to make them pay more out-of-pocket.” 

Schatz was joined on the floor by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky Rosen (D- Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.). 

A transcript of Senator Schatz’s remarks is available below. Video is  available here  . 

After months of swearing up and down that they were focused on lowering the price of eggs, the price of groceries, the price of gas, the price of insurance. That was what the last election was about, right? It was about inflation. It was about the amount that people were paying. That's what the last election was about. Interestingly, the very first thing that Donald Trump and the Republicans have decided to do is to cut taxes for billionaire corporations, and they're going to pay for it by ripping off working Americans. 

Now, that might sound like a political talking point. It sounds too convenient, too absurd. How can you spend four years pounding on the party in power about how much people are getting hit in the pocketbook? The price of eggs, the price of utilities, the price of gasoline…which is still in Hawai‘i around $4.59 a gallon. People are still paying too much. And yet the first order of business is not to do anything about that. It's not to do anything about that. It is to cut taxes for the wealthiest international corporations in human history. 

I'm here today with my Senate Democratic colleagues, and I want to make a sort of broader point. As Democrats struggle through, learn about, argue about what went wrong over the last 2 to 4 years politically, one of the things that we did not do well enough is stay on the same theme. This place gets crazy, and it's especially crazy with Donald Trump president. I remember. And it's distracting. 

And even in the best of circumstances, people fly home and then they arrive on Monday. There's a 5:30 vote. And oftentimes the last vote is on Thursday at 1:45. And so we talk about one thing from Monday at 5:30 until Thursday at 1:45. And the thing we talk about is often whatever is on the floor or whatever is in committee. We're going to do that. We have to do that. We have to comment on what we're working on. But we're also going to talk about this rip-off tax bill, because that illustrates the difference between the parties. It is going to illustrate in three dimensions that all of this talk about lowering costs was a lie. 

I'm here with Senate Democratic colleagues, including members of the Senate Finance Committee, led by Senator Wyden on the Democratic side, who will be on the forefront of this particular fight. And we're not here because we're surprised that Republicans are going to raise and not lower costs, because we know that was the plan all along. We're not here because we're shocked that Republicans want to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy. They do that like clockwork every time they win the House and the Senate and the presidency. We're here because nothing can distract us from the reality of what is about to happen. This will be a giveaway of the worst kind at a time when people can least afford it. 

So how do they plan to do it? And this is a little technical, so bear with me. So House Republicans are saying you got to pay for these tax cuts, right? You reduce revenue to the government. In order to pay for it, you have to find savings. You have to either get new revenue. That's kind of off the table for Republicans. They don't like new revenue unless it's tariffs, which Americans pay or you got to cut something. 

And so last Friday this document was released. And I understand if you're watching this on your phone or even on C-SPAN, it’s kind of small, right? I get it. But this document listed these so-called pay-fors. In other words, how are they going to pay for these massive tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals, the wealthiest privately held and publicly held corporations in human history? And here are just a couple of the things that they're using as so-called pay-fors. 

$700 billion in cuts, kicking millions of people off of Medicaid. $500 billion out of Medicare, reducing access to care for seniors everywhere. More than $150 billion in cuts to the Affordable Care Act subsidies. And what does that mean? If you're on ACA, if you get your health care through ACA, the subsidy goes away, your monthly insurance bill is about to skyrocket. Tens of millions of Americans who pay for their health insurance through the ACA exchange and receive that subsidy are going to have to pay more. And what happens with that money? It doesn't go for roads. It doesn't go for fire houses. It doesn't go for public health. It goes to this tax cut. 

I am not exaggerating. This is not a rhetorical flourish. This is not a political talking point. They are literally cutting Medicare, Medicaid, possibly Social Security, the Affordable Care Act. And they're going to take all these resources, these are their pay-fors, and shovel it to people so that they can continue their private jet subsidies, pay a lower tax rate, eliminate the 15 percent minimum billion-dollar corporation tax. 

When we were in charge, there were lots of the wealthiest corporations, international corporations in the history of the planet that paid zero taxes. Zero taxes. And so what did we do both to generate money – but also because it's a question of basic fairness – we established a minimum rate for these wealthy corporations. And they want to eliminate that too. Why? Because this is what they do. Because that is actually their governing philosophy. 

You know, they say campaign in poetry govern in prose. That's not what's happening here. They campaigned on misleading people. That they're abiding concern – their main concern – was, gosh, people are paying too much for a dozen eggs. And I don't mean to diminish that. People were paying too much for a dozen eggs. But right now, and, inflation is 2.7 percent, and gas in a lot of places across the country is below three bucks. And so people were paying too much and people were rightly pissed off, by the way at Democrats too, for not recognizing how acute this problem was for a lot of American families. I get it. But I don't know anybody who thinks the solution to people paying too much out of pocket is to make them pay more out of pocket. 

There's not a single voter that I know, not a single voter that I know, that I've interacted with, who says, ‘You know what? Gosh, I wish the highest corporate tax rate were just a little bit lower. Gosh, I wish the 15 percent minimum billion-dollar corporation tax were rescinded. Gosh, I wish people who are being subsidized that they can afford health care, I wish we would eliminate that. And gosh, I wish we would use all that money and shovel it back to the wealthiest people in the world.’ 

And so we're not going to stop talking about this. I just had two hearings with Sean Duffy and Marco Rubio. I know Pam Bondi was today. Lots of very exciting and interesting things are happening, and we're going to have to comment on that. We're going to have to engage in that. But every week, we're going to be talking about this rip-off. Every opportunity we get, we are going to be talking about this. Because this is the difference between the two political parties.

11:03:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON — At today’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee nomination hearing for Secretary of State nominee, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) questioned Rubio on his approach to strengthening relations with key Pacific Islands partners, elevating the U.S. alliance with the Philippines, and rethinking the United States’ North Korea policy. 

Schatz requested Rubio’s views on continuing to strengthen the United States’ relations with Pacific Island nations, asking,  “I’d like your theory of the case here about how to have some continuity… [regarding] specifically these small island nations with whom we want stronger ties.” 

In response, Rubio said,  “The first, obviously, is the ability to engage bilaterally with each of these individual nation states. And that opportunity is already there, and I think we should continue to build on it, and it’s important and bears great fruit.” 

Schatz then questioned Rubio about the U.S.-Philippines alliance, asking  , “How [do] you see that growing democracy, one of our best allies on the planet? How [do] you see that as strategically important for the United States?” 

In response, Rubio said,  “It’s always been strategically important for the United States… There are long ties between the United States and Philippines that date back to 1899 and the Spanish-American War. So I think it’s important to build on that as well. I think there are real economic opportunities that are worth exploring.” 

Schatz also raised the issue of North Korea, asking,  “I think our North Korea policy is broken… Is there an appetite for a rethinking of this – in my view – totally failed policy?” 

In response, Rubio said,  “I think there has to be an appetite for a very serious look at broader North Korea policies.” 

Schatz has led efforts to advocate for closer ties to Pacific Island nations and the Philippines, which would help expand economic and political prosperity and counter China’s growing aggression in the region. He has also pressed for a re-examining of the United States’ strategy towards North Korea.

11:03:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – During a nomination hearing for Sean Duffy, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) secured commitments to continue the longstanding tradition of bipartisanship at the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as to keep funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law flowing to states. 

Schatz, a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, asked Duffy,  “I’d like for you to offer clarity to this whole committee and to your staff, your future staff, that you’re going to continue in that long tradition of bipartisanship, and really nonpartisanship as it relates to transportation policy.” 

In response, Duffy said,  “Infrastructure is not partisan. I am committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to make sure we are looking at the best projects and the safest record. I look forward to doing that…We can do that together in Hawai‘i.” 

On funding from the infrastructure law Congress passed in 2021, Schatz said,  “It’s a federal law, it was a bipartisan law, and I just want your assurance that in terms of releasing funds, that this will all be done on the level and not be intermediated by political concerns.” 

In response, Duffy said,  “Absolutely, you have my commitment. We will be on the level.” 

Schatz, who is Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, also raised the importance of meeting the specific transportation needs of Native communities. 

Duffy assured Schatz,  “I think you’re right, providing assistance, simplifying the process to make sure that our Tribes can access money that’s available to them to make sure they can build their Tribal infrastructure and roads. It’s an important part of the way I think about transportation and would welcome the chance to work with you on that.”

11:03:26 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. – Today, House Budget Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced  legislation  to reverse President Biden’s  ban  on offshore oil and gas drilling. 

“In the final hours of his presidency, President Biden finished off four years of self-inflicted disasters by continuing his all out assault on domestic energy production,”  said Chairman Arrington.  “Banning oil and gas production on millions of acres of offshore waters takes direct aim at American energy producers, threatening national security, and empowering adversaries like Russia, all just to take one last bow for the woke and climate obsessed mob. Senator Cruz and I are fighting to repeal this dangerous policy, unleash American energy, and ensure a clear path for President Trump's America First agenda on day one.” 

"President Biden’s ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling is an attack on American energy independence, jobs, and national security,”  said Senator Cruz.  “His action is a gift to our adversaries and once again confirms that this President prioritizes green special interest over the livelihood of American energy workers. Today, I am introducing legislation to overturn this executive order. Under President Trump, we achieved energy  dominance  and I am committed to leading the fight to restore it and protect Texas jobs.” 

“Our nation’s vast offshore resources are a critical source of affordable energy, government revenue and stability around the world,”  said Holly Hopkins, American Petroleum Institute VP of Upstream Policy.  “We welcome the efforts of Sen. Cruz along with those of Rep. Arrington to reverse the Biden administration’s disastrous 11th hour decision to ban new oil and natural gas activity across millions of acres of federal waters.” 

“NOIA applauds Senator Cruz and Congressman Arrington for their efforts to repeal the Biden Administration’s politically driven offshore oil and gas ban,”  said Erik Milito, President of the National Ocean Industries Association.  “By lifting these restrictions, Congress restores the nation’s ability to leverage its offshore energy resources, strengthening the economy and protecting our national security. [The bill] will drive confidence in U.S. investment and energy policy, rather than our adversaries’, ensure adaptability to geopolitical changes, and protect American interests. This bill is a prime example of the long-term, strategic approach to energy policy the U.S. needs.” 

"We applaud Chairman Cruz and Representative Arrington’s leadership introducing the Overturn Biden's Offshore Energy Ban Act to reverse a short-sighted, political, and harmful decision by the outgoing Administration to ban vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf from future exploration, undermining America's ability to meet its future energy needs,”  said Dustin Van Liew, EnerGeo Vice President of Global Policy & Government Affairs.  “  It is essential to recognize that increased exploration of natural gas and petroleum is required to maintain a stable and balanced energy mix for the country. The Gulf of Mexico, in particular, plays a crucial role in America’s energy production and is a critical source of supply for global allies, and restricting access to these resources could harm the nation’s energy security and economic stability. Continued exploration and innovation are crucial for addressing both environmental and energy demands in a way that ensures long-term sustainability and balance.” 

"Producing all our nation's vast natural resources creates millions of good-paying USA jobs and lowers gas, grocery, and utility costs for every American,”  said Matt Coday, President and Founder of Oil & Gas Workers Association.  “Joe Biden's ban on Outer Continental Shelf drilling hurts our jobs, hurts every American, and funds terrorists. USA oil and natural gas exports  help free our friends and allies around the world from dependence on Russia, China, and Iran.  We are grateful Senator Cruz and Representative Arrington are leading the fight to overturn the Biden ban and ensure we achieve American energy dominance under President Trump." 

Background: 

  * On January 6, 2025, President Biden issued two Presidential proclamations making 625 million acres of federal offshore waters ineligible for oil and natural gas drilling. 
  * This lame duck ban covers the entire East Coast, the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, the entire contiguous West Coast, and several parts of Alaska, all while significantly restricting America’s energy supply potential at a time of skyrocketing demand. 
  * This bill  introduced  by Chairman Arrington, in  coordination  with Senator Cruz in the Senate, would overturn this burdensome ban.

11:03:30 root         DEBUG    Titles: Congressman Brecheen Reintroduces Healthy SNAP Act to Exclude SNAP Benefits for Junk Foods and Soft Drinks
11:03:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Josh Brecheen reintroduced the Healthy SNAP Act. The bill would exclude soft drinks, candy, ice cream, and prepared desserts from being purchased with SNAP benefits. The bill also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that eligible food promotes the health of SNAP recipients and reflects nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns. 

Fox News' Liz Elkind wrote an exclusive report on the bill, which you can read here. 

“President Trump has been given a mandate by the majority of Americans to Make America Healthy Again, and those in his administration, like RFK Jr. and Senator Marco Rubio, have directly advocated for eliminating junk food purchases with SNAP. This legislation advances President Trump’s agenda by ensuring that SNAP is used for nutritious foods, rather than junk foods and soda that contribute to long-term health issues. If someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that’s up to them. But what we’re saying is, don’t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences. As Oliver Anthony, in his viral song “Rich Men North of Richmond," said, “Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds.” Americans know this is common sense! 

Over 42 million Americans are currently receiving SNAP benefits—that’s about 1 in 8 people. More than 20% of all federal SNAP spending goes towards the purchase of junk foods and sugary drinks (sugary drinks alone make up 10%). Approximately 75% of adults and around 33% of children in the United States are currently overweight or obese. 

In addition to the obvious health improvements, this bill will also result in significant savings in taxpayer funds for such programs as Medicaid, where approximately 1 in 4 Americans (79 million total) are currently enrolled. Federally funded healthcare for obesity and obesity-related diseases has reached $400 billion per year, according to the Senate Joint Economic Committee (JEC) 2023 report. We can’t afford to go down this road any longer as a nation,” - said Congressman Josh Brecheen. 

Co-sponsors include Representatives Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Michael Cloud (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Glenn Grothman (R-WI), Dan Meuser (R-PA), Mary Miller (R-IL), and David Schweikert (R-AZ).

“The so-called Inflation ‘Reduction’ Act takes patients out of the frying pan and into the fire – leading to higher list prices for prescription drugs, decreased plan choices for seniors, higher premiums, and fewer treatment and cures.   


“Since the IRA took effect, research and development of at least 22 potentially life-saving drugs has been abandoned—with more expected. The Biden-Harris Administration’s approach has led to increased use of prior authorizations, less access to drugs on formularies, and more barriers to care. I look forward to working with President Trump to blunt the worst impacts of the IRA and pass meaningful solutions—like PBM reform—that will lower the cost of drugs without sacrificing hope for patients, families, and caretakers.”

11:03:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) introduced the Disaster Reforestation Act, a bill to help working forests recover from a natural disaster by amending the tax code to recognize the value of destroyed timber. 

  
The current tax code disadvantages forest landowners by restricting their ability to claim loss from destroyed timber, harming their ability to reforest lands. Timber typically takes 20 to 80 years to yield profit for the forester, making it extremely difficult to recover after a catastrophic loss. 

  
By providing for the equitable tax treatment of casualty loss of their timber crop when disaster strikes, this bill will foster stability and growth for foresters in one of Georgia’s key industries and promote environmental wellness through reforestation and wildfire prevention. 

  
“A single storm can wipe out a generation’s worth of investment into a private working forest. Many foresters are unable to replant following a loss, causing a supply chain crunch in the lumber market, economic strain on local economies, and environmental harm due to lack of forestland. The Disaster Reforestation Act will protect foresters from the worst impacts of natural disasters, ensuring timber farming is a viable way of life and protecting the many jobs, products, and positive environmental impacts this industry provides,”  said Rep. Carter.

11:03:35 root         DEBUG    Titles: Carter wins fight against NOAA's jobs-killing speed restriction for Atlantic Coast
11:03:35 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) today successfully urged the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to rescind a proposed jobs-killing speed restriction for boats 35’ to 65’ along the Atlantic Coast. 

  
The move comes after boaters, harbor pilots, and business owners raised concerns that the new safety regulations, nobly designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale from extinction, will pose safety risks for commercial vessels, threaten up to 340,000 American jobs, and negatively impact nearly $84 billion in economic contributions without providing any meaningful protections for the species. 

  
“I am thrilled that NOAA made the right decision to protect harbor pilots, small business owners, and our coastal economy. This proposed rule was burdensome, overreaching, and would have caused irreparable harm to the Atlantic Coast without providing any environmental benefits. Tracking technologies exist that would help prevent right whale vessel strikes, and I hope to see those more broadly used in the coming years,”  said Rep. Carter. 

  
In June 2023, Rep. Carter introduced a bipartisan bill that would have delayed funding for this proposed speed restriction until the Department of Commerce could fully implement new monitoring systems for North Atlantic right whales. 

  
“We’re in full agreement with Rep. Buddy Carter. There are other potential technology solutions that need to be studied further for the safety of the North Atlantic right whales and safety at sea of mariners. This situation affects the entire U.S. East Coast. The Georgia Ports Authority appreciates the need for reasonable regulation to protect the North Atlantic right whale. However, any new measure must appropriately balance conservation goals with the safe and efficient movement of cargo into and out of our nation’s ports,”  said Griff Lynch, President and CEO of Georgia Ports Authority.    
  
  
“The sportfishing industry is pleased to see the draconian vessel speed rule withdrawn so that we can find a collaborative, long-term solution that effectively mitigates the potential for vessel strikes and incorporates innovative safety technologies,”  said Mike Leonard, Vice President of Government Affairs for the American Sportfishing Association.  “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration, Congress, and other stakeholders to protect North Atlantic right whales, anglers, boaters and the $230 billion sportfishing industry. We also thank Rep. Carter for his continued leadership in advocating for policies that support the marine environment and all those who depend on it.”   
  
  
"On behalf of the recreational boating industry, we thank Congressman Carter (R-GA) for his leadership to protect coastal communities and American manufacturers from harm under the proposed NOAA rule and for ensuring the federal government leverages the latest technology to safeguard endangered marine mammals,” said  Frank Hugelmeyer, President and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association  , the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry.

11:03:36 root         DEBUG    Titles: Carter, Buchanan introduce bill reinstating Trump-era policy that increases health care options for Americans
11:03:36 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Reps. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA), Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), Rick Allen (R-GA), Mike Kelly (R-PA), and Julia Letlow (R-LA) today introduced the Healthcare Freedom and Choice Act, a bill that reinstates a Trump-era policy which increases health care options and lowers costs for Americans, following the Biden Administration’s repeal of the rule in 2024. 

  
This bill reinstates individuals’ access to short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI) plans for up to 36 months, an increase from the Biden Administration’s rule limiting access to 4 months. STLDI provides Americans with affordable, temporary health coverage options. For millions of Americans, STLDI is the only option for filling a gap in health insurance coverage. 

  
“Limiting Americans’ access to health care is never good policy, particularly during a cost-of-living crisis courtesy of the Biden-Harris Administration. I’m proud to lead this effort ensuring that health care is accessible and available to all patients in need and will continue working hand-in-hand with the incoming Trump Administration to Make America Healthy Again,”  said Rep. Carter. 

  
“The Biden administration’s rule limiting Americans’ heath care choices is misguided and costly. Rising health insurance costs are crippling small business owners and families with soaring premiums, forcing Americans to pay for more expensive health insurance. Americans deserve to have more options on the table that are affordable for them and their families. I look forward to working with Congressman Carter and the incoming Trump administration to rescind this and other ill-advised Biden administration health care policies to ensure that Americans can make personal decisions about their own health care,”  said Rep. Buchanan. 

  
“The first Trump Administration expanded plan offerings by removing unnecessary federal requirements around short-term health insurance. The idea is simple: if you need comprehensive long-term coverage, you get comprehensive long-term coverage. If you need short-term insurance—maybe you’re between plans or young and healthy—get short-term insurance,”  said Rep. Crenshaw.  “I’m glad we’re taking this first step to reclined Joe Biden’s overwrought regulations and restore health care options for all Americans.” 

  
“Americans overwhelmingly support choice in healthcare. Yet, the Biden Administration has consistently issued unnecessary rules that limit options, increase costs for consumers, and could leave more Americans uninsured. I am proud to cosponsor Representative Carter’s Healthcare Freedom and Choice Act, which would restore a Trump-era policy giving hardworking taxpayers additional options and autonomy for short-term care. I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to bring commonsense, consumer-driven reforms to our nation’s healthcare system,”  said Congressman Allen. 

  
“Lawmakers should work to make health care more affordable for Americans, not more expensive. This legislation would expand health care freedom and reverse this problematic and costly Biden administration measure. I look forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to improve health care access and affordability,”  said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), Chairman of the Ways & Means Subcommittee on Tax. 

  
The bill boasts support from: America First Policy Institute, Americans for Prosperity (AFP), National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The LIBRE Initiative, Health Benefits Institute, Heritage Action, and several additional organizations. 

  
“We applaud Congressman Carter and the cosponsors of this timely and much-needed legislation because it restores an affordable health insurance option that all Americans should have, but which was callously ripped away by the Biden Administration. Thanks to Obamacare and other costly government mandates, Americans today suffer from a critical lack of affordable health care options. For the three million Americans who relied on them before the Biden Administration moved to eliminate them, short term health plans offered a welcome alternative to costly Obamacare-style coverage. Short-term plans provide good, comprehensive benefits. They're flexible, portable, and available year-round. And they're affordable, typically costing 50% to 80% less than a traditional, Obamacare-style plan. For families struggling with the high cost of health care, a short-term plan can be a life-saver. No wonder 78 percent of Americans tell us they support the availability of this affordable option. Our thousands of activists across the country will be working to enact this bill because it promotes a Personal Option -- hassle-free health care you can afford,”  said AFP Senior Health Policy Fellow Dean Clancy. 

  
“Minority communities already face significant challenges with reliable access to health care and the Biden administration exacerbated the problem when it chose to limit access to short-term health insurance plans. This legislative effort protects patient choice at a time when Americans are desperate for more options to meet their health care needs. Fortunately, Rep. Carter stands for greater options and flexibility not just for the nearly 1 in 10 of his constituents that are Latino but for all  Americans,”  said  Isabel Soto, Policy Director, The LIBRE Initiative  . 

  
“The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) applauds Representatives Buddy Carter, Vern Buchanan, and the cosponsors for their leadership in introducing legislation to repeal the Administration's harmful short-term limited duration (STLDI) insurance regulation, which severely restricts health care choices for small business owners. At a time when employers are acutely struggling with unsustainable health care costs and diminished options, small businesses need flexible, affordable, and predictable health care options. This legislation is an important step toward restoring health care choice and addressing a significant operational challenge that has plagued Main Street for nearly 40 years,”  said  Josselin Castillo, Principal, Federal Government Relations  . 

  
“The 2018 Trump administration rule liberalizing the availability of short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans was an important step toward providing Americans with more and less expensive choices for their health insurance. The Biden administration rule repealing the Trump rule was a step backward, forcing Americans to purchase more expensive health insurance than they want or need. Congressional efforts to rescind the Biden rule will go a long way toward restoring Americans' ability to choose the insurance plans that work best for them,”  said CEI Senior Fellow Joel Zinberg. 

  
“Fixed indemnity and short-term limited duration coverage are important products to consumers. States have long regulated these products, and the Biden administration rules not only interfered with state regulation but would have eliminated consumer choice. The Health Benefits Institute applauds this bill for putting consumers first, allowing them to extend coverage, and protecting them from potentially exorbitant, unexpected healthcare costs,”  said J.P. Wieske, Executive Director of the Health Benefits Institute.  “We encourage Congress to act swiftly and pass the bill so President Trump can sign it before another American is forced to go without insurance.” 

  
“The Biden administration proved over and over again that it was allergic to making Americans’ health care more affordable and easier to access. Biden’s rule reducing short-term health plans was an abuse of authority that drained Americans’ finances and hurt their ability to stay covered. Extending short-term, limited-duration health plans gives Americans more freedom to afford the care they need. Heritage Action encourages members of Congress who support easier access to health care to effectively rescind the Biden administration’s overreach by supporting the Healthcare Freedom and Choice Act,”  said Heritage Action Executive Vice President Ryan Walker.

Background 

In 2018, the Trump Administration issued a rule increasing the duration a person could access short-term health plans for up to 36 months. 

  
In April 2024, Biden finalized a rule that repeals the Trump-era policy and decreased the period a person can access short-term insurance to four months.

11:03:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) released the following statement today after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) unanimously voted to release a second interim staff report on pharmacy benefit managers’ (PBMs) egregious practices, finding that the top three PBMs marked up drugs for chronic disease patients by as much as 1,000 percent: 

  
“Pharmacy benefit managers are stealing hope and health from patients, outrageously marking up the cost of lifesaving medications and refusing to dispense lower-cost alternatives. Just three PBMs made more than $7 billion in markups alone, while premiums continue to rise, independent pharmacies are shuttered, and chronic disease patients are forced to go without the medication prescribed by their doctor. What PBMs are doing to our health care system is criminal, and I applaud the FTC for acting in a bipartisan manner to shine a light on the industry’s abhorrent practices. Our health care system puts profits before patients, and it’s time for a change. Patients are counting on us to enact common sense reforms, and I will continue leading that charge.”

11:03:39 root         DEBUG    Titles: "Are These Families Not American?": Rep. Carbajal Blasts Calls for Conditioning California Disaster Aid
11:03:39 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:39 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) called out House Republicans for  repeatedly  suggesting  this week their interest in obstructing delivery of vital federal disaster aid to Southern California. 

The Congressman’s full remarks can be viewed  here  . 

“Are these families not Americans?,”  Rep. Carbajal said  . “What makes these families different from families we have helped after hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods? To suggest that we should hold hostage the aid we give American families–families who have lost everything–is wrong and unamerican.” 

Congressman Carbajal highlighted a recent report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that found that families in  Florida, Louisiana, and Texas received the most federal disaster aid over the past decade  – relief that was provided without political conditions or policy riders. 

Congressman Carbajal represents Santa Barbara County and portions of Ventura County, areas that have seen severe wind and red flag warnings over the past week. He also represents many of the California firefighters who have been deployed to Los Angeles County to help fight multiple deadly fires across the region. 

During Congressman Carbajal’s first term in Congress, the Thomas Fire destroyed hundreds of structures across the Central Coast and forced the evacuate of more than 100,000 Californians. The fire, at the time the largest in California history, cleared hillsides of all vegetation – creating the conditions for the deadly debris flows in early 2018 that killed more than 20 people in Santa Barara County. 

The Congressman’s full remarks as prepared for delivery can be found below: 

“Mister Speaker, I rise today to say–Los Angeles, we are with you. 

Our hearts are with every single family who has lost a loved one, a livelihood, or some part of their community. We also give thanks to the heroic first responders working to contain these fires and help those in need. 

But I also rise to ask, Mister Speaker – are these families not Americans? 

What makes these families different from families we have helped after hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods? 

To suggest that we should hold hostage the aid we give American families–families who have lost everything–is wrong and unamerican. 

Just look at what has been approved over the past decade, especially for so-called red states, I might add. 

Have we ever said that those families should be punished for their state’s political choices? Absolutely not. 

I am appalled and frankly sickened at calls for conditioning aid these American families. They are crying out for help. Congress should respond, without hesitation or delay.”

Castor also requested detailed information regarding the extent of damages, restoration timelines and USPS’ strategy for disaster relief in impacted areas.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy 

USPS Headquarters 

475 L’Enfant Plaza SW 

Washington DC 20260-0010 

RE: Restoration of Tampa Bay Area U.S. Postal Service Operations following Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton 

Dear Postmaster General DeJoy, 

Thank you for your leadership and service to our nation. On behalf of my neighbors across the Tampa Bay region, I respectfully request your assistance in restoring U.S. Postal Service operations following Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton 

As you may know, Florida experienced three hurricanes during the months of August through October 2024. The Tampa Bay community was severely impacted by the storms and suffered widespread damage and destruction. My team and I have spent the past few months assessing the damage and speaking with neighbors and business owners directly about the tragic loss of homes, livelihoods and property. I am grateful for the federal resources and personnel that were surged into our region immediately following the disasters as well as the passage of the American Relief Act at the conclusion of the 118th Congress. The $100 billion disaster package will deliver resources to help Tampa Bay neighbors get back on their feet and support the rebuilding of critical infrastructure across Tampa Bay. I am proud to have championed many of the disaster relief package’s provisions and am committed to further recovery needs in my community, for individuals, businesses and services alike. 

It is my understanding that seven post offices across the region are currently closed as a result of damage sustained by these storms. I would like to specifically bring attention to two post offices in Florida’s 14th congressional district, which is the economic heart of Tampa Bay: 

  * Ruskin, 455 N. US Highway 41, 33570 
  * Town N Country, 7521 Paula Dr., Tampa, 33615 



The latest USPS public announcement regarding business service disruptions was on November 4th, confirming that operations at the two locations listed above are temporarily suspended due to hurricane damage. The Ruskin post office has been closed since September 25, in anticipation and as a result of Hurricane Helene’s impacts. The Town N Country office has been closed since October 8, due to Hurricane Milton. While I appreciate the temporary operations at alternative locations, the needs of my neighbors and business owners who heavily rely on the Ruskin and Town N Country post offices are not sufficiently being met. The prolonged shift in operations and lack of updates for reopening have resulted in general confusion and frustration, lengthier wait-times at the alternative locations, and accessibility issues for constituents who utilize and depend on essential postal services. It is with all of this information in mind that I strongly urge you to expedite the repair and reopening of the Ruskin and Town N Country post offices. 

Additionally, I would like to request additional information regarding the following: 

  * Please provide details on the damage sustained at the Ruskin and Town N Country post offices? 
  * What is the USPS approach to disaster relief, specifically for the restoration of impacted facilities? 
  * What is the latest status of restoration efforts at these two post offices? 
  * Do you have a timeline estimate for the reopening of each post office? 
  * How are you communicating to customers about these locations’ closures and temporary operation relocations? 
  * Do you have an estimate of how many customers these closures are impacting? 
  * How are you dealing with cases of individuals who hold a P.O. box at one of the closed locations? 
  * Have you considered utilizing Postal Mobile Retail Units at the Ruskin/Town N Country post office locations? 



I respectfully request that you scrutinize the USPS operations of Tampa Bay post offices, specifically the Ruskin and Town N Country facilities, impacted by hurricanes in recent months. Thank you for your attention and timely response. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact my Legislative Assistant, Daniela Clark-Murrieta, at daniela.clark-murrieta@mail.house.gov or 202-225-3376. 

Sincerely, 

Kathy Castor

11:03:45 root         DEBUG    Titles: Dingell, Fitzpatrick Reintroduce Bill Expanding Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage
11:03:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:03:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) today reintroduced the bipartisan Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage Act to expand Medicare to cover hearing aids for beneficiaries. Medicare does not currently cover hearing aids, which have an average price upwards of $2,500. 

“Hearing aids aren’t a luxury, they are critical for millions of people to maintain a healthy, independent lifestyle. Without them, many seniors cannot interact with family, friends, neighbors, and their communities, and as a result, can become isolated,”  said Dingell.  “By expanding coverage for hearing aids under Medicare, more seniors will be able to live with dignity and independence. I’m proud to re-introduce this legislation, and remain committed to getting this signed into law to expand access to care for so many who need it. It’s simple: No one should feel isolated, confused, or shutout from the world because they can’t afford hearing aids.” 

“Hearing loss is more than a medical condition—it’s a barrier to independence, communication, and dignity,”  said Fitzpatrick  . “For millions of seniors across our nation, Medicare’s outdated prohibition on hearing aid coverage has meant enduring unnecessary isolation and a diminished quality of life. With nearly 48 million Americans affected by hearing loss, the stakes are too high to ignore. Our bipartisan Expanding Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage Act is a decisive step forward in ensuring our seniors have access to the essential care they need to remain active, engaged, and valued members of our communities.” 

The Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage Act is endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. 

“American seniors have been sorely lacking access to affordable hearing aids, even though proper hearing care is crucial to good health,”  said Max Richtman, President & CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.  “Traditional Medicare does not cover hearing aids, but it should. We strongly support Rep. Dingell’s Medicare Hearing Coverage Act, which will help make hearing aids affordable – and in so doing, improve the health and safety of millions of seniors. We are glad to see that Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is co-leading this bill, validating hearing coverage for seniors as a bipartisan issue. No seniors should feel isolated, confused or shut out from the world because they can’t get hearing aids. The introduction of Rep. Dingell’s bill is good news that older Americans and their families have been waiting a long time to hear.” 

Hearing loss affects nearly 48 million Americans and left untreated, has serious emotional, social and medical consequences for older adults. Research has shown older adults with hearing loss are 32 percent more likely to require hospitalization, face a 24 percent increased risk for cognitive impairment, and increasingly suffer from isolation and depression. A 10-year longitudinal study of patients in Baltimore found that those with hearing loss had a higher probability of developing dementia, with the probability rising as the severity of the hearing loss increased. 

Expanding hearing health care has long been one of Rep. Dingell’s top priorities. She  first introduced  legislation to allow Medicare to provide coverage for hearing aids in 2015. The bill also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on insurance programs that provide services to help with hearing loss. 

The Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage Act is cosponsored by Representatives Adam Smith (D-WA), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), John Larson (D-CT), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Doris Matsui (D-CA), Josh Harder (D-CA), LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), Henry C.

11:03:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06) today announced MAHLE Powertrain in Plymouth was awarded $6 million from the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) to develop electrically heated methane oxidation catalysts, which will help reduce methane emissions from gas engines. 

“This federal funding, which comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, is a win for Michigan’s auto industry and our efforts to combat climate change,”  said Rep. Dingell.  “By supporting advanced technologies like these electrically heated methane oxidation catalysts, we’re not only helping to reduce methane emissions but also driving innovation that will keep Michigan at the forefront of the evolving auto industry. This project will have a direct and positive impact on the Plymouth community by making the air we breathe cleaner and healthier for everyone. It’s a win for the environment, for our community, and for our future.” 

The federal funding is part of an initiative under the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act to reduce methane pollution, particularly in the oil and gas sectors, through the Methane Emissions Reduction Program. This program aims to reduce methane emissions from industrial sources, which are a significant contributor to climate change.

11:03:47 root         DEBUG    Titles: Dingell Statement on Department of Commerce Connected Vehicle Final Rule
11:03:47 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:03:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06) today released the following statement on the  Department of Commerce’s final rule  to prohibit certain transactions involving the sale or import of connected vehicles integrating specific pieces of hardware and software, or those components sold separately, with a sufficient nexus to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or Russia. 

“As our vehicles become smarter, safer, and increasingly connected, it’s important we’re taking action to mitigate security risks, especially when this technology is coming from countries of concern, like China and Russia. An investigation by the Department of Commerce concluded that technology from these adversarial countries poses a real risk both to consumers and to American infrastructure,”  Dingell said.  “For example, we know that Chinese automakers are deploying autonomous vehicles in the U.S. for surveillance and data collection, meanwhile banning American vehicles from their own streets. This rule is an important step to combat the real threat that foreign-made connected vehicle technology poses. We must maintain our leadership at the forefront of the global auto industry in a way that protects Americans’ privacy and safety and strengthens our national security.” 

The final rule establishes that hardware and software integrated into the Vehicle Connectivity System (VCS) and software integrated into the Automated Driving System (ADS), the systems in vehicles that allow for external connectivity and autonomous driving capabilities, present an undue and unacceptable risk to national security when designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia. Malicious access to these critical supply chains could allow our foreign adversaries to extract sensitive data, including personal information about vehicle drivers or owners, and remotely manipulate vehicles. 

Today’s final rule prohibits the import of VCS hardware or connected vehicles containing such hardware, and the import and sale of vehicles containing VCS or ADS software, with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia. VCS is defined as the set of systems that allow the vehicle to communicate externally, including telematics control units, Bluetooth, cellular, satellite, and Wi-Fi modules. ADS includes the components that collectively allow a highly autonomous vehicle to operate without a driver. 

The rule also prohibits manufacturers with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia from selling new connected vehicles that incorporate VCS hardware or software or ADS software in the United States, even if the vehicle was made in the United States. 

The software-related prohibitions will take effect for Model Year 2027. The hardware-related prohibitions will take effect for Model Year 2030, or January 1, 2029, for units without a model year. Prohibitions on the sale of connected vehicles by manufacturers with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia, even if manufactured in the United States, take effect for Model Year 2027. 

Last year, Dingell sent a letter to the Department of Commerce  urging them to take action  to address the privacy and security risks and trade implications posed by connected vehicle technology manufactured and controlled by foreign adversaries, including China.

11:03:49 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Representative Brittany Pettersen (CO-07) reintroduced the Silver Cliff Community Act, which would restore the Town of Silver Cliff’s ZIP Code. 

In 1991, the Town of Silver Cliff lost its unique ZIP Code and was forced to use the ZIP Code of the neighboring town of Westcliffe, which has resulted in delays and extensive errors with postal delivery, as well as a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax revenue. This bill would reinstate the original ZIP Code to the Town of Silver Cliff, decoupling them from Westcliffe and alleviating these issues. 

“Coloradans depend on reliable postal service for everything from prescription drugs and billing notices to food, clothing, and other necessary items,”  said Pettersen.  “However, because Silver Cliff lost their unique ZIP Code, there’s been delayed and lost deliveries, subpar postal service, as well as thousands of dollars lost in sales tax revenue. I will continue working with Mayor Wenzel to fix this issue and deliver solutions for the Town of Silver Cliff.” 

“I'm so appreciative of Congresswoman Pettersen's relentless and aggressive pursuit to restore our original ZIP Code - 81249 - to the Town of Silver Cliff,”  said Mayor H.A. Buck Wenzel.  “In 1991 the USPS arbitrarily, capriciously and without public hearing deactivated our ZIP Code and forced our town to use the ZIP Code of the neighboring Town of Westcliffe. The deactivation of our ZIP Code stole our identity and has caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in the loss of sales tax revenue from online, out of county and out of state sales.” 

Pettersen first introduced the  Silver Cliff Community Act  last Congress. In December, the House  passed  H.R. 8753 which included Pettersen’s provision to restore the Town of Silver Cliff’s unique ZIP Code, but the legislation stalled in the Senate. 

  


As a founding member of the bipartisan  Delivering Postal Solutions Caucus  , Pettersen is committed to solving postal issues across her district. Since coming to Congress, Pettersen has  sent  several letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy urging USPS to take action to restore the Silver Cliff ZIP Code, as well as to address subpar service and delays in communities throughout Colorado.

11:03:50 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:03:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: LAKEWOOD  – Today marks the first day U.S. Representative Brittany Pettersen (CO-07) is unable to vote and represent her constituents in Washington, D.C. because of outdated House rules that prohibit a Member from voting remotely. Pettersen is expecting her second child in just a few weeks and is prohibited from flying due to medical and travel restrictions. 

Representative Pettersen  is leading  the call to allow proxy voting – or remote voting – for Members of Congress who are new parents. This commonsense measure was not implemented by Republican Leadership despite bipartisan support, so Pettersen will continue fighting for this reform. Current House rules prohibit proxy voting, forcing Members to choose between their official duties and taking care of their newborns during a crucial time. 

“I can’t physically be in D.C. to vote because I’m unable to fly this close to my due date,”  said Pettersen.  “It’s unreasonable that the House refuses to make any accommodations for people who are pregnant or welcoming a new child. We will continue to fight to bring our resolution to the floor for a vote and will work on measures like this to make Congress more accessible to young families.” 

Even though Pettersen will be unable to vote in-person in Washington, D.C., she will continue working on behalf of Colorado’s 7th Congressional District here in Colorado. Her offices in Washington, D.C., Lakewood, and Cañon City will also remain fully open and operational for the constituents of Colorado’s 7th Congressional District. Her staff will continue to assist Coloradans with navigating federal agencies like the IRS, Social Security, Medicare, and more.

11:03:52 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:03:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congresswoman Chellie Pingree today announced $298,000 in grants from the National Endowment for the Art (NEA) to support 11 organizations in Maine’s First District.  NEA announced a total of $37 million  to support 1,474 arts programs across the U.S. 

“From painting and music to theater and literature, the arts are woven into the fabric of Maine’s history, culture, and economy. Grants from the National Endowment for the Arts are essential to ensuring that arts programs across the country have the resources to engage, inspire, and strengthen the communities they serve,”  said Congresswoman Pingree, Co-Chair of the Congressional Arts Caucus.  “As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the NEA, I’ve seen firsthand how investments in the arts empower individuals and transform entire communities. I’m proud to support this funding, which will go a long way in advancing the missions of these deserving Maine organizations and preserving the creative spirit that defines our state.” 

“The NEA is proud to continue our nearly 60 years of supporting the efforts of organizations and artists that help to shape our country’s vibrant arts sector and communities of all types across our nation,”  said NEA Chair Maria Rosario Jackson, PhD.  “It is inspiring to see the wide range of creative projects taking place—those that address our past and help us consider our future, integrate arts and culture in new ways into our lives and communities, and provide powerful opportunities for people throughout our nation to come together through a shared arts experience.” 

The 10 First District projects receiving funding are as follows: 

  * $15,000 for the Bowdoin International Music Festival (Brunswick)  to support the festival’s Chamber Music Educational Institute 
  * $20,000 for the annual Salt Bay Chamberfest (Damariscotta) 
  * $45,000 for the Alice James Poetry Cooperative, Inc. (New Gloucester)  to support the publication and promotion of poetry titles 
  * $30,000 for the Watershed Center for the Ceramic Arts (Newcastle)  to support a mentor and mentee artist residency program 
  * $20,000 for the Maine Academy of Modern Music (Portland)  to support the annual Resurgam Music and Arts Festival 
  * $20,000 for Mayo Street Arts (Portland)  to support an international puppetry festival 
  * $55,000 for Portland Ovations (Portland)  to support a multidisciplinary performing arts series 
  * $15,000 Portland Stage Company, Inc. (Portland)  to support the premier production of “Madeleines” by Bess Welden 
  * $10,000 for TEMPOart Portland (Portland)  to support a temporary art installation 
  * $45,000 for the Camden International Film Festival (Rockport)  to support professional development programming for nonfiction filmmakers and media artists 
  * $23,000 for Maine Crafts Association (West Gardiner)  to support a master-apprenticeship program for contemporary craft artists 



This latest round of NEA grants also includes funding for four projects in Maine’s Second District. 

Pingree is Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, which oversees funding for NEA. As Chair of the Subcommittee in the 117th Congress, Pingree oversaw an Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2023 that dedicated the highest-ever level of funding for the arts and humanities, including $207 million each for the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). 

Established by Congress in 1965, the NEA is an independent federal agency that is the largest funder of the arts and arts education in communities nationwide and a catalyst of public and private support for the arts. By advancing equitable opportunities for arts participation and practice, the NEA fosters and sustains an environment in which the arts benefit everyone in the United States.

“As we navigate a Republican-controlled Congress and another Trump presidency, I’m grateful to my Democratic colleagues for once again entrusting me to lead the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which will no doubt be on the frontlines of Republican attacks on the climate progress we made under President Biden,”  said Pingree.  “As ranking member of the subcommittee in the 119th Congress, I am committed to defending those gains, fighting back against attempts to further erode our ability to respond to and combat the climate crisis, and working with members from both parties to fully fund our trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations, preserve our national parks and monuments, and protect cultural agencies that support every state and district in the country.” 

As Chair of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee in the 117th Congress, Pingree wrote Appropriations bills for the 2022 and 2023 Fiscal Years that made unprecedented investments that reflect House Democrats’ enduring commitment to environmental justice, renewable energy, health infrastructure on tribal lands, and the arts, among other notable investments.

11:03:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) today released the following statement on the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas: 

I am relieved that after 467 days of fighting, over 47,000 Palestinian deaths, more than 2,000 Israeli deaths, and unfathomable destruction and devastation, Israel and Hamas have reached a long overdue agreement to cease hostilities and release hostages. This could not have been achieved without tireless diplomatic efforts to bring both parties to the table, and I am grateful the Biden Administration got this agreement across the finish line before leaving office. 

There is still a lot of uncertainty; the Israeli Cabinet needs to approve the deal, hostages need to be released, and humanitarian aid needs to pour into Gaza. I remain cautiously optimistic, but this is a promising step forward.

11:03:55 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:03:55 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, and U.S. Representatives Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, today are announcing the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) decision to award $22 million in funding for Maine’s  Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub  , led by the Maine Technology Institute. The grant will support the advancement of two projects that aim to further position Maine as a global leader in forest-based biomaterial production and manufacturing. 

“Maine is a leader in the forest products industry — both here at home and around the globe,”  said the Delegation  . “An investment in our forestry sector is a direct investment into Maine’s economy and future. This $22 million award for the Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub will be critical in ensuring we have the tools to strengthen the workforce, spur innovation and further build upon the industry’s success.” 

The grant will support implementation of two projects that include: 

· Connecting forest bioproducts technological innovations with the commercialization resources and partnerships necessary to successfully bring that intellectual property to market at a globally competitive scale and serving as the backbone organization for the consortium, coordinating governance, strategy, evaluation, and community engagement; and 

· Strengthening a pipeline of innovations (functionalized feedstocks, applications, and manufacturing technologies), de-risking these innovations with technical assistance, and leveraging new commercialization, advanced manufacturing, and workforce resources of the Tech Hub to accelerate the most promising innovations. 

Last March, the Delegation  wrote a letter  to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development expressing their support for Maine’s application for a Tech Hubs Implementation grant. In addition to the Delegation letter, Senator Collins sent a follow-up  letter  advocating for this program to receive Tech Hubs grant funding. Previously, the Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub received a $500,000 Consortium Accelerator Award to continue implementing their strategies, including the pursuit of additional capital, and was among six Tech Hubs across the country to receive awards from additional funding through the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 

The Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub is among  31 Tech Hubs  designated in October 2023 designated by the Department of Commerce to scale up the production of critical technologies, create jobs in innovative industries, strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness and national security, and accelerate the growth of industries of the future in regions across the United States. 

In 2016, Senators Collins and King called on the  U.S. Department of Commerce to establish the Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT)  , that would work across agencies and sectors to create strategies for job growth and economic development in Maine’s rural communities. The creation of the EDAT and its subsequent studies and research led to the EDA and the U.S. Forest Service providing funding for the Forest Opportunity Roadmap Maine (FOR/ME) Initiative. The  FOR/ME Initiative  is a participant-led initiative that is helping to diversify the state’s wood products businesses, attract investments, support research and development, and develop greater economic prosperity for rural communities impacted by mill closures.

11:03:56 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:03:56 root         DEBUG    Desc: > Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) today announced millions of dollars in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for clean energy initiatives across Maine, including $8.7 million to help Maine’s Fox Islands advance their ambitious clean energy goals and more than $5.2 million in Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) funding to support local businesses in their transition to clean energy. 
> 
> The funding for Fox Islands Electric Cooperative’s (FIEC) project, made possible through the Inflation Reduction Act and the USDA’s Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program, will fund significant upgrades to the Fox Islands Wind project and the installation of a solar array on Vinalhaven, increasing energy independence, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy costs for the rural island communities. The funding will allow the FIEC to modernize its wind turbines and diversify its energy generation with solar power—steps that will help meet growing local energy demands and reduce reliance on mainland power. Pingree wrote to USDA in support of the FIEC project. 
> 
> "The Fox Islands have been pioneers in rural clean energy since 2008, when nearly 99 percent of cooperative members voted to develop wind power for our islands,”  said Pingree.  “Now, thanks to this federal funding, North Haven and Vinalhaven will be able to take the next big step forward in energy independence and climate action. By upgrading wind turbines and adding solar power, these rural island communities will be able to meet growing energy demands while significantly reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and costs for island residents. This is exactly the kind of innovative, community-driven project that the Inflation Reduction Act was designed to support, and I'm proud to help bring these federal dollars back to Maine." 
> 
> “The projects are the next step in the Fox Islands’ path toward energy independence, securing reliable, affordable, and responsible sources of energy for the Fox Islands,”  said Fox Islands Wind’s CEO Amy Turner.  “We appreciate the USDA’s investment and recognition that Fox Islands Wind’s New ERA projects integrate natural resources with modern technology to advance small grid capabilities while preserving our rich cultural heritage.” 
> 
> The ERA program, created through the historic Inflation Reduction Act, is a key part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to support climate-smart initiatives in rural communities. The Fox Islands project is an example of how federal investments can help advance energy resiliency, reduce emissions, and support rural economies. 
> 
> The USDA’s funding for the Fox Islands project is part of a $6 billion investment  announced Friday  to support clean energy initiatives across 30 states. 
> 
> “In just two years, the New ERA and PACE programs have created dozens of new partnerships with rural electric cooperatives and communities that will reduce pollution, create jobs and make clean energy more affordable for millions of rural Americans,”  USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  “These investments we’re making today will continue to support the health, prosperity and well-being of rural Americans for generations to come.” 
> 
> As part of  the announcement  , USDA is also awarding $120 million in REAP grants and loans for  516 projects  in 39 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This program helps farmers and small business owners make energy efficiency improvements and expand their use of wind, solar and other forms of clean energy. 
> 
> REAP funding for projects in Maine’s First District includes: 
> 
>   * $5,025,000 for Alna Community Solar LLC  to build a 2.7 MW DC ground-mounted solar project located in rural Alna, Maine. It is expected to produce 3,600,278 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity in the first full year of operation. 
>   * $21,000 for Monhegan Brewing Company LLC  to install a new 8.2-kilowatt (kW) roof-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) system with battery storage. The system is expected to save the business $6,754 in annual energy costs. 
>   * $51,000 for Brunswick Town Holdings LLC  , a small commercial real estate company in Gray, Maine, to install a new 39 kilowatt (kW) roof-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The system is expected to generate 51,710 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. 
>   * $44,950 for Grovest 101 LLC  , a small real estate business located in Wiscasset, Maine, to install a new 30.6-kilowatt (kW) roof-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The project is expected to generate 39,260 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. 
>   * $75,000 for PKS Woodworks LLC  , a third-generation woodworking company located in South Berwick, Maine, to install a new 52.8-kilowatt (kW) roof-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The system is expected to save $10,479 in annual energy costs. 
> 

> 
> “These investments are a testament to the effectiveness of the REAP program in supporting rural communities’ transition to renewable energy,”  said Pingree.  “By reducing energy costs, these projects enable local businesses to reinvest in their operations and workforce, fostering economic growth and sustainability in Maine. The success of REAP funding across Maine highlights the program’s substantial impact in supporting rural communities with renewable energy initiatives. These projects not only contribute to our state’s climate goals but also provide direct economic benefits to local businesses and consumers.” 
> 
> “The Biden-Harris Administration is lowering costs and giving rural Americans the historic opportunity to expand clean energy and build an economy that benefits working families and small businesses,”  Secretary Vilsack said.  “By expanding access to homegrown biofuels and clean energy systems, we are making long-lasting investments that will strengthen our energy independence, address the impacts of climate change and create new market opportunities and revenue streams for American producers while bringing good-paying jobs to rural communities.” 
> 
> In addition to the five projects in Maine’s First District, this latest round of REAP grants will include funding for 12 projects in Maine’s Second District. 
> 
> The IRA, championed by House Democrats and signed into law by President Biden in August 2022, represents the single largest investment in climate and clean energy solutions in American history. 
> 
> In 2023  , Pingree and all Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee wrote to Chair Glenn “G.T.” Thompson (R-Pa.) and Ranking Member David Scott (D-Ga.) to protect the rural clean energy funding passed in the historic Inflation Reduction Act in the upcoming Farm Bill. 
> 
> Pingree is the author of the  Agriculture Resilience Act  , comprehensive legislation that sets a bold vision of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in U.S. agriculture by the year 2040. In addition to serving on the Agriculture Committee, Pingree is the  Ranking Member of the Appropriations Interior  , Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, which she chaired in the 117th Congress.

11:04:00 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:04:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC — Co-chairs Paul D. Tonko (NY-20) and Dave Joyce (OH-14) and Vice Co-Chairs Madeleine Dean (PA-4) and Jen Kiggans (VA-02)  today announced the  relaunch of the Congressional Addiction, Treatment, and Recovery (ATR) Caucus  . Throughout the 119th Congress, the representatives will lead bipartisan group of legislators committed to advancing bipartisan solutions to the country’s multifaceted addiction crisis. 

“For over 20 years, the ATR Caucus has served as a forum for representatives in Congress to develop bipartisan solutions to the addiction crisis that save and improve lives,”  Congressman Tonko said  . “With every community across our nation impacted by this epidemic, it’s beholden on all of us to address this disease of despair with a response rooted in hope. I look forward to working with my colleagues to combat this crisis with compassion and resolve.” 

“The opioid crisis continues to destroy communities in Ohio and across the country. We owe it to our constituents and to this nation to support those suffering from addiction and increase access to proven forms of treatment,”  said Congressman Joyce.  “The Addiction, Treatment, and Recovery Caucus has found commonsense, bipartisan solutions to our nation’s addiction problem for over 20 years, and I am proud to be a co-chair alongside my colleague, Rep. Tonko. Together, we will work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve and expand access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services for Americans.” 

“The beginning of a new Congress is a time to renew our priorities — and the Addiction, Treatment, and Recovery Caucus is once again ready to find common ground solutions to uphold our common humanity,”  Rep. Dean said.  “Addiction is an utterly devastating disease that has touched every community in our nation, yet my family knows that recovery is not only possible but joyful. I want that hope and possibility for every family. I’m grateful to Chairmen Paul Tonko and Dave Joyce for their leadership — and I look forward to working alongside Congresswoman Jen Kiggans as Vice Chairs in our efforts to break the stigma of substance use disorder, spread awareness, and support recovery. Together, we can help save lives.” 

“With more Americans dying from overdoses than ever before, we need to do everything we can to reduce and prevent addiction,”  said Congresswoman Jen Kiggans.  “Addiction doesn’t discriminate based on zip code – it has infiltrated every community and left far too many families without their loved ones. It’s time to change the narrative and show Americans that help is out there and there is a path to recovery. I am honored to join my colleagues on the Addiction, Treatment, and Recovery Caucus to find meaningful solutions for substance use disorder, ensuring our children and all Americans live long, happy, and healthy lives.” 

The ATR Caucus is the first and longest running congressional caucus that recognizes addiction as a disease  . For the last 21 years, the ATR Caucus has served as a forum for Members of Congress to come together in a bipartisan fashion to address the stigma of addiction and work together to save lives. 

At a time when the United States is facing an overdose crisis, coupled by a nation-wide shortage of healthcare professionals, the ATR Caucus will serve as a forum for bipartisan action to support communities across the United States and drive commonsense solutions to the problems underpinning the crisis. The ATR Caucus has long been dedicated to education and to raising awareness among lawmakers about addiction with a strong focus on increasing support for expanding access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services. 

Last Congress, the ATR Caucus held and collaborated on more than 20 events  , including a visit to  Fairfax County Adult Detention Center  , a  Methadone 101 informational briefing  , a Naloxone training and discussion, and more.

11:04:02 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:04:02 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC—Congressman Paul D. Tonko (D-NY)  announced today that he has been reselected to serve as  Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment  . Tonko will also serve on the Subcommittee on Energy, and Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations. 

These appointments position Tonko, one of just a handful of engineers in Congress, to continue leading Congressional efforts to build national climate action, invest in drinking water infrastructure, and promote science-based environmental policies that protect public health while growing the economy. 

“We know all too well the threats that face us should we fail to boldly and meaningfully act on climate, as we are seeing with the devastating and deadly wildfires sweeping though LA,”  Congressman Tonko said.  “In the 117th Congress, we passed once-in-a-lifetime legislation that is helping to turn the tide of climate change while igniting U.S. global leadership in clean energy and creating good paying jobs. With so much at stake, we cannot allow climate-deniers to claw back this historic progress. I stand ready to get to work building solutions that protect our environment, public health and communities, and that ensure a brighter future for generations of Americans to come.” 

Titled the Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, & Critical Materials last Congress, the Environment Subcommittee has jurisdiction over many of the nation’s most important environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. It played a crucial role in developing and enacting provisions affecting the Environmental Protect Agency in the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 

Tonko previously served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee during the 116th and 117th, and as Ranking Member during the 113th, 114th, 115th, and, most recently, the 118th Congresses.

11:04:03 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Paul D. Tonko (NY-20)  today cheered  recent action from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  to implement the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act —  legislation championed by Tonko  that was signed into law in July, 2024. 

As mandated by the law, HHS delegated authority to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish a Federal Advisory Council on Parkinson’s Research, Care, and Services that will provide advice on Parkinson’s-related issues, including recommendations for priority actions to be included in the national plan. 

A form for submitting advisory council nominations can be found  HERE  . 

“For years, I pushed to enact my National Plan to End Parkinson’s to, at long last, create a federal plan to address Parkinson’s and bring hope to those living with this disease,”  Congressman Tonko said.  “This recent announcement is the first promising step towards reaching that goal. I’m grateful to HHS and NIH for their partnership and dedication in driving research and treatments on Parkinson’s, and I pledge to continue to do all I can to ensure that this law is implemented to the fullest extent to make a difference for those living with this disease.” 

Once established, the Federal Advisory Council overseen by NIH will: 

  * Ensure coordination among federal entities with responsibility for managing, treating, and curing Parkinson’s disease; 
  * Evaluate all current federal programs related to Parkinson's; 
  * Write a national plan to prevent and cure Parkinson’s, and reduce the financial impact of the disease on patients and the federal government; and 
  * Report to Congress on progress toward the plan’s goals.

11:04:05 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:04:05 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Today, Congressman David Valadao (CA-22) and Congressman Jim Costa (CA-21) introduced two pieces of legislation, the  Groundwater Technical Assistance Act  and  Every Drop Counts Act  , to address California’s ongoing water challenges and expand water storage and groundwater recharge opportunities. These bills enhance the effectiveness of existing federal programs, which provides critical support to the Central Valley. 

“As a dairy farmer and lifelong resident of the Central Valley, I know firsthand the devastating impacts of water shortages on our agricultural industry, communities, and economy,”  said Congressman Valadao.  “Water is the lifeblood of our region, and these pieces of legislation take essential steps to maximize water storage, recharge groundwater, and ensure California has access to this vital resource. With these improvements, we can better address the challenges of drought, stabilize our water tables, and secure our water future.” 

“Groundwater recharge is one of the most effective ways to build resilience against drought,”  said Congressman Costa.  “These bipartisan bills build on the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by leveraging federal resources for groundwater recharge projects that provide long-term solutions to safeguard the San Joaquin Valley from the impacts of extreme drought.” 

Supporting organizations for the  Groundwater Technical Assistance Act  include: Tulare Irrigation District, Kern Fan Groundwater Project (Irvine Ranch Water District and Rosedale-Bravo Water Storage District, and Self-Help Enterprises. 

Supporting organizations for the  Every Drop Counts Act  include: Friant Water Authority, Kern Fan Groundwater Storage Project (Irvine Ranch Water District and Rosedale-Bravo Water Storage District), Idaho Water Resource Board, San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, Tulare Irrigation District, and Self-Help Enterprises. 

The  Groundwater Technical Assistance Act  will: 

  * Provide funding to an authorization under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that allows the Bureau of Reclamation to provide technical and financial assistance for groundwater recharge projects. This includes aquifer storage and recovery projects, or water source substitution for aquifer protection projects. 
  * Grants the Bureau of Reclamation greater flexibility to address groundwater recharge needs without requiring new spending. 



The  Every Drop Counts Act  will: 

  * Modify the Small Storage Program to increase the size cap for groundwater recharge projects. 
  * Provide additional eligibility criteria to ensure more groundwater projects can apply for funding and are incentivized to recharge depleted aquifers.

11:04:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, Congressman David Valadao released a statement addressing last week’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations in Kern County. 

“I have been in contact with Customs and Border Protection regarding the recent immigration enforcement actions in Kern County, and I was informed these operations were focused on apprehending known criminals or those with ties to criminal organizations in our community,”  said Congressman Valadao  .  “I have received numerous calls from constituents expressing fear for their families’ safety, and I do not support inciting concern. I think we can all agree known criminals should be expelled from the United States, but it is crucial that future operations are communicated clearly to avoid causing any further alarm among our farmworkers. I urge the Biden Administration—and future administrations—to ensure CBP prioritizes targeting criminals rather than those responsible for producing our nation’s food supply. We urgently need common sense immigration reform that creates a pathway to earned legal status for hardworking individuals contributing to our economy while ensuring the removal of those who threaten the safety of our communities, and I am looking forward to working on new legislation to combat these issues in Congress.”

11:04:09 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:04:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-01) announced the re-introduction of four pieces of legislation to support veterans and bring more accountability and transparency to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation is aimed at removing administrative roadblocks to Veterans Administration (VA) services and improving the customer experience within the VA. 

"Our veterans made great sacrifices for us on the battlefield, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for that service,”  said Congressman Wittman.  “These bills make it easier for veterans to access services within the VA, improve the care they receive once they enter the VA system, and help connect veterans with mental health and counseling resources during times of crisis. I’m proud of my work to advocate for Virginia’s veterans community, but there is much more to be done. I look forward to advancing these bills during the 119th Congress.” 

Rep. Wittman introduced the following bills: 

  * Veterans Choice Accountability Act  :  Expands veteran access to non-VA medical care and establishes a review of the VA’s implementation of the Veterans Choice Program. 

  * Veterans Collaboration Act  :  Establishes a VA pilot program to foster collaboration between qualified non-profit veterans service organizations (VSOs) and educational institutions that provide assistance to veterans. 

  * Veterans Affairs Transfer of Information and Sharing of Disability Examination Procedures with DoD Doctors Act  :  Accelerates access to care for veterans by not subjecting them to another round of medical screenings before a disability rating is issued and requires the VA and U.S. Department of Defense to share medical and service record data electronically. 

  * BRAVE Act  :  Creates a notification system to alert veterans of counseling and mental health options in response to crises and prioritizes privacy concerns of veterans by allowing them to opt-in to receive these notifications. 




In October 2024, Rep. Wittman held veterans seminars in  Mechanicsville  and  Midlothian  to convene veterans, their families, support organizations, and community members to provide resources and discuss the challenges faced by the veterans community in Virginia’s First District. He held a  veterans-focused telephone town hall in November 2023  with Commissioner Daniel Gade of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services and a  veterans roundtable in February 2023  .

11:04:09 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:04:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-01) announced the re-introduction of the  Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act  , which  passed the U.S. House of Representatives last year  . The legislation will prohibit the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture from banning the use of lead ammunition or tackle on federal lands and waters unless such regulation is consistent with state law and supported by science. 

“As a lifelong hunter and recreational fisherman, I was appalled by the Biden-Harris administration’s quest to restrict access for our nation’s sportsmen and women who use traditional lead fishing tackle and ammunition on federal lands and waters,“  said Congressman Wittman.  “We cannot allow a ridiculous ban like this to happen again. Effective environmental stewardship and wildlife conservation rely on the valuable contributions of our hunters and anglers, and affordable lead ammunition and tackle are crucial to reducing financial barriers that limit accessibility for sportsmen and women. I was proud to see this legislation pass the House last year, and I’m committed to securing its passage once again to advance it through the Senate and to the president’s desk.” 

The bill is supported by the American Sportfishing Association, National Shooting Sports Foundation, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Safari Club International, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and National Rifle Association. 

“Congressman Wittman is a champion for outdoorsmen and women across our country, and his work on the Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act is the kind of sound policy we need in Congress,”  said House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman.  “As an avid hunter and fisherman myself, I support this legislation to ensure hunting and fishing remain an easily accessible part of American life. I look forward to working to help usher it through the legislative process.” 

Background: 

Congressman Wittman originally introduced this legislation in response to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) decision to enter settlement negotiations with activist litigants like the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) over a lawsuit regarding the use of traditional ammunition and lead on over 3 million acres of federal land. In October 2023, the Biden-Harris administration issued a final rule to prohibit the use of lead ammunition and tackle in eight national wildlife refuges. The concern over the potential ban of lead ammunition and tackle is due to the fact that lead ammunition is easier and cheaper to make and more readily available for consumers. Banning its use would make hunting less accessible by increasing the financial barriers for sportsmen and women.

The  Congressional App Challenge  promotes student participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education by encouraging middle and high school students to design, build, and present innovative apps for mobile, tablet, or computer devices. 

Congressman Wittman continues to advocate for STEM education to prepare students for the modern workforce. In January 2024, he  emphasized the importance of investing in STEM  to strengthen Virginia’s education system and economy in an  op-ed for the Richmond Times-Dispatch  . In December 2023, he hosted a  STEM education seminar at Virginia Commonwealth University  – where he earned his Ph.D. in public policy and administration – to provide local educators, administrators, and parents with resources to prepare students for in-demand careers in STEM fields.

“As a lifelong fisherman, I have seen firsthand the impact of shark depredation on our marine ecosystem and the sportfishing community,”  said Congressman Wittman.  “The  SHARKED Act  will address these challenges by enhancing marine life conservation and improving conditions for anglers, all while ensuring sharks are protected from harmful practices and unsafe food sources.

11:04:14 root         DEBUG    Titles: ICYMI: Womack, Boozman Bill to Strengthen Oversight of Veterans' Care Signed Into Law
11:04:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:04:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC—January 15, 2025…Representatives Steve Womack (AR-3), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Chris Pappas (NH-1), and Dave Joyce (OH-14) are celebrating the passage of their legislation to strengthen oversight and accountability at the U.S. Department of Veterans of Affairs (VA). Senator John Boozman (R-AR) crafted the companion legislation in the Senate. The bill was signed by President Biden on January 2, 2025. 

The  VA Office of Inspector General Training Act  requires VA employees to complete trainings from the VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) so that staff are fully informed on how to report waste, fraud, and abuse and participate in whistleblower processes and investigations. 

Congressman Womack said  , “I’m grateful the VA OIG Training Act is now the law of the land. VA employees will be fully equipped and prepared to report waste, fraud, and abuse. Adequate oversight and accountability at the VA saves taxpayer dollars and, more importantly, saves veterans’ lives. This legislation works to ensure the tragedies that occurred at the Fayetteville VA Medical Center never happen again.” 

Senator Boozman said  , “It is critical to empower every VA employee with tools to identify and report wrongdoingin orderto enhance the services it provides, help protect the lives under its care and safeguard taxpayer resources. I’m pleased our bill is now law and will help deliver greater transparency and accountability, which we owe the men and women who have served in uniform.” 

Congresswoman Underwood said,  “Making VA stronger and ensuring it provides world-class care and the benefits our veterans deserve is a top priority for me in Congress. The VA OIG Training Act will improve oversight and require VA employees to learn how to report wrongdoing. This bipartisan legislation will promote a culture of integrity and accountability at VA, protecting taxpayer dollars, and improving the care our veterans receive. I am so proud that it is now law.” 

Congressman Pappas said,  “The VA Office of the Inspector General plays a critical role in helping curtail waste, fraud, and abuse at VA, but my office has heard from VA employees in New Hampshire that many VA staff are unaware of the services they provide. The VA OIG Training Act will increase awareness of these services and reassure VA employees that they will be protected if they report wrongdoing to protect both our veterans and taxpayer dollars. I’m pleased that this bipartisan legislation has been signed into law, and I will always work to strengthen services at VA and address the needs of New Hampshire veterans.” 

Congressman Joyce said,  “The men and women who have selflessly served our country in uniform deserve the highest quality of care, but that can only happen if the VA is operating efficiently and being held accountable to the veterans they serve. I am proud to see the VA OIG Training Act officially signed into law to ensure VA employees are reporting wrongdoings correctly so that our nation’s veterans get the care they need.” 

Details: 

In 2021, VA Secretary Denis McDonough signed a directive requiring all VA employees complete an OIG training, but this legislation codifies the policy ensuring it cannot be rolled back by future administrations. The VA OIG Training Act makes the requirement permanent. 

VA’s OIG works to improve the efficiency and integrity of VA operations. The office’s effectiveness depends on the participation of VA employees. Early and accurate reporting by staff can save patients’ lives, ensure veterans receive benefits and services, and recoup billions of dollars. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General Training Act will: 

  * Require every current and future VA employee to participate in a training from VA's OIG about reporting to and cooperating with the OIG. 
  * Ensure that the VA OIG’s training includes information about: 
    * Mechanisms for reporting fraud, waste, abuse, and other wrongdoing at the VA. 
    * Protections for VA employees who report wrongdoing to the OIG. 
    * Opportunities to strengthen OIG programs, operations, and services to ensure the OIG can provide effective oversight, reduce fraud, and protect taxpayer dollars.

11:04:15 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC—January 14, 2025…Today, Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) voted to support  H.R. 28, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025  , which passed the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation protects women’s and girls’ safety and ensures equal access to opportunity by banning a person whose biological sex at birth was male from participating in a school’s athletic program or activity that is designated for females. 

Congressman Womack said  , “Standing up for female athletes is very important to me. I grew up with four sisters—one of whom became an All-American—coached female teams and have been a follower of women’s sports my entire life. I’m also proud to represent a district that’s rich in history of competitive female sports. It’s incomprehensible that we’re even having this conversation. There’s no disputing the fact that in most sports, biological males have a distinct, undeniable advantage over females. To deprive a female athlete of her hard-earned roster spot in the name of political correctness is backward and wrong.” 

Details: 

  * Title IX prevents discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding and is intended to provide women and girls with equal educational opportunities. Last year, the Biden Administration released a  rule  amending Title IX that would eliminate a state’s ability to comprehensively protect women and girls from discrimination in athletics. Last week, a federal judge struck down the Biden Administration’s rule. This legislation ensures no future Democrat Administration or activist judge can force these misguided policies on the American people. 
  * To date, 26 states have enacted policies to protect equal athletic opportunities for women and girls. Immediate action is necessary to prevent confusion about the circumstances under which states, schools, and institutions can protect the integrity of women’s athletic competitions. 
  * H.R. 28 clarifies that a recipient of federal education funding violates Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination if the recipient operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs or activities that allow a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls. Sex in the athletic context must be recognized based only on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.

11:04:16 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:04:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC—January 13, 2025…Congressmen Steve Womack (R-AR-3) and Ed Case (D-HI-1) reintroduced  H.R. 222, the  Sustainable Budget Act  .  They were joined in co-introduction by Congressmen Scott Peters (D-CA-50) and Zach Nunn (R-IA-3). The legislation would create a national commission charged with developing policies to balance the budget within 10 years, meaningfully address the nation’s exploding debt, and put America on a better fiscal trajectory. 

Congressman Womack said  , “The exploding national debt is one of the greatest threats to our country. America faces many current and future challenges, which cannot be adequately addressed if we continue down an unsustainable path of fiscal irresponsibility. This bipartisan commission will be tasked with making difficult, yet necessary, decisions to right the financial ship and protect the futures of our children and grandchildren.” 

Congressman Case said  , “By any measure, our federal fiscal house is out of order. The U.S. national debt now stands at over $36 trillion, with interest on the debt crowding out whole segments of critical federal spending. We appear trapped in a continuing cycle of further $1 trillion-plus annual deficits and accelerating overall debt. Our annual interest costs now surpass national defense, surpass Medicare, and surpass all non-mandatory, non-defense programs (veterans, education, transportation, etc.) combined. It is inescapable that the underlying problem is our collective inability or unwillingness to prioritize fiscal responsibility and sustainability.” 

Congressman Peters said  , “The national debt is now more than $36 trillion. We spend more on our interest payments alone than we do on defense or Medicaid, which provides medical care to the most vulnerable Americans. Our borrowing problem is making it harder for people to get child-care, more difficult to start small businesses, and more expensive to rent or buy a home. It's well past time for Congress to have a fact-driven discussion about the federal budget.” 

Congressman Nunn said  , “Families, farmers, and Main Street business owners balance their budgets – the federal government should do the same. We must cut wasteful government spending while protecting the programs that Iowans rely on. A bipartisan commission can help make the necessary changes to restore a sensible, functional government that works for the people, not one that recklessly spends taxpayer money.” 

Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said,  “We commend Representatives Case and Womack, along with co-introducers Representatives Peters and Nunn, for working together in a bipartisan fashion to put forward the Sustainable Budget Act. This legislation would create a commission to serve as a venue for constructive bipartisan negotiations to improve our country’s fiscal future. We applaud them for introducing this bill to pursue bipartisan solutions to reduce our nation’s debt.” 

Details: 

The  Sustainable Budget Act  would create a bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, consisting of 18 members chosen by the president, the Speaker of the House, the House minority leader, and Senate majority and minority leaders. They would be tasked with identifying and developing policies to balance the budget within 10 years and meaningfully improve the long-term fiscal outlook. Any recommendations by the commission would be required to be considered and voted on by Congress under expedited legislative procedures. 

Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) has represented Arkansas’ Third Congressional District since 2011. He is a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

11:04:18 root         DEBUG    Titles: Hayes Leads Legislation to Protect the Department of Education
11:04:18 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:04:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05)  introduced the Department of Education Protection Act as her first piece of legislation of the 119th Congress. The bill would shield the U.S. Department of Education from efforts to dismantle the agency and ensure every student receives the free and appropriate public education they deserve. 

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter oversaw the creation of the modern U.S. Department of Education, an accomplishment hailed as a hallmark of his legacy after his death. The Department is vital for providing equal educational opportunity for all and protecting the rights of students and educators. 

During the first Trump Presidency, the Administration sought to underfund, reorganize, and through executive actions urge the downsizing of the Department. These efforts were revitalized during the 2024 campaign as President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to "close" the agency if he regained the White House. Amidst these threats, several members of the House of Representatives and Senate have led legislation to abolish and defund the education agency. 

“Public education is a right – any efforts to compromise the integrity of our education system would be a grave disservice to the nearly 50 million public school students and the entire nation,”  said Congresswoman Hayes  . “Given the troubling rhetoric around public education from the incoming Administration, it felt necessary that my first bill of the 119th Congress be to safeguard this federal pillar. I am leading the  Department of Education Protection Act  to impede any attempts to shrink federal education resources or restructure the agency. Instead of depleting the agency of its resources, we must invest in its ability to promote student achievement, foster education excellence, and ensure equal access.” 

Specifically, the Department of Education Protection Act would prohibit the use of appropriated funds to be used to decentralize, reduce the staffing level of, or alter the responsibilities, structure, authority, or functionality of the Department of Education. This bill also emphasizes the importance of maintaining the current organization of the Department of Education and reiterates the fundamental role of Congress in shaping and reshaping the agency. 

The Department of Education Protection Act has been cosponsored by Representatives Alma Adams (NC-12), LaMonica McIver (NJ-10), Andrea Salinas (OR-06), Dina Titus (NV-01), and Jill Tokuda (HI-02)

11:04:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today,  Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05)  released the following statement after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas was announced: 

“Today, President Biden announced a ceasefire agreement negotiated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt that would lead to the end of the Israel-Hamas war. This ceasefire mirrors a previous proposal brokered by President Biden in  May of 2024  and unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council. 

The proposed agreement includes an end to hostilities and the release of hostages who have been held captive by Hamas for over 15 months. This deal will also allow critical humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and assist the millions of people who this conflict has impacted. 

Since the beginning of this conflict in October of 2023 I have repeatedly called for the release of all hostages and that Israel allow humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza. I am pleased the proposed ceasefire accomplishes both goals. 

I am grateful to President Biden and Vice President Harris for their tireless efforts to find a deal that will bring peace to the region and see the hostages, including American citizens, reunited with their loved ones.”

11:04:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C  . – Today,  Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05)  released the following statement on H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025, which passed the House of Representatives, 218-206-1: 

“As a teacher and mother, I know the issue of transgender students in sports is complicated and emotional for many and I believe many athletic governing bodies have been slow and inconsistent in updating their policies to address the concerns of parents. However, it is not the role of Congress to dictate to competitive and non-competitive sports leagues of all ages their rules for participation, and today I voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. 

This legislation opens the door for federal overreach into an issue that schools, states, and sports associations should address. School districts and athletic associations are better prepared to understand the sports they regulate and how to guarantee both respect for transgender people and fairness in sports—not federal government politicians. 

By advancing a blanket ban on the participation of transgender individuals, Republicans place every child at risk. H.R. 28 provides neither a specific enforcement mechanism nor resources to ensure that students participating in athletics meet these new standards. This means schools will turn to administrators, coaches, or even volunteers to inspect the genitalia of children if a question is raised before they are allowed to participate in sports. 

The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Federation of Teachers, the Human Rights Campaign, the Matthew Shepard Foundation, the NAACP, the National Organization for Women, the New Haven Pride Center, and PFLAG Hartford and at least one hundred other organizations oppose this legislation. 

Contrary to its name, this bill does nothing to protect women and girls in sports or address the increasing lack of athletic opportunities for women at the collegiate level or provide resources for equipment and coaches. It is my goal to protect all children, and I hope to work with my colleagues in Congress to come up with commonsense legislation that achieves this goal.”

11:04:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: WATERBURY  – Today,  Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05)  joined Governor Ned Lamont, Senator Richard Blumenthal, and Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garret Eucalitto to announce a series of federal grants for rail improvements across the state. 

The Fifth District projects highlighted included two Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) grants aimed at expanding rail services and making necessary safety improvements. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CTrail Hartford Line will receive a $11.61 million  Restoration and Enhancement Program  grant to increase services and enhance connectivity for the region. 

Additionally, a $2.4 million  Railroad Crossing Elimination (RCE) Grant  has been awarded for the Danbury Branch Grade Crossing Engagement, Planning, and Consolidation Program Project. This funding will assist the Connecticut Department of Transportation perform additional studies and develop a plan to eliminate the Taylor Avenue grade crossing and implement significant improvements at Triangle Street and Commerce Avenue. 

In June 2024, Congresswoman Hayes submitted a letter of support to the U.S. Department of Transprotation for the Danbury Line project. Safety improvements on the Danbury Line are long overdue and the need was only amplified after a fatal crash at the Commerce Street crossing in 2023. The Devine Brothers, Commerce, Triangle, and Taylor Street crossings on the Danbury Line have raised alarms, ranking respectfully as having the first, fourth, and tenth highest predicted accident rates of any crossings on Metro North Rail in Connecticut. 

“I represent 41 towns and cities that often feel disconnected from the state. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been critical in closing the gaps and getting residents of the Fifth District where they need to go,”  said Congresswoman Hayes.  I am pleased to see this federal investment in our rail system that will reduce delays, improve reliability, and expand services. I thank the Biden-Harris Administration for its commitment for rebuilding our infrastructure to benefit communities for future generations.”

USDA Plant Protection Act Funds Will Support MSU, Miss. Dept. of Agriculture Efforts 

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced the award of more than $667,000 in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) funding for projects in Mississippi to combat agricultural pests and diseases. 

The  USDA Plant Protection Act Section 7721  funding will support a series of Mississippi-based programs administered by the Mississippi State University (MSU) Extension Service and Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (MDAC). 

“Detecting and combatting plant pests and diseases is critical to the protection of agricultural production in Mississippi. It’s a constant battle and this USDA funding will help our state identify and fight threats to our crops and forests,”  said Hyde-Smith,  who serves on both the Senate Agriculture Committee and Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. 

FY2025 Plant Pest and Disease Management and Disaster Prevention Program  awards for Mississippi total $502,763 and include:   
• MSU Invasive Insect Screening Lab – $170,000   
• MSU Mississippi Bug Blues/Invasive Insect Education Outreach – $122,000   
• MSU Bug Eyes/Volunteer Invasive Insect Searches – $63,500   
• MSU Mississippi Bug Blues Educator Education Boxes – $55,900   
• MSU Asian Defoliator Survey – $48,949   
• MSU Pine Pest Survey – $39,414   
• MDAC Exotic Bark Beetle Commodity Survey – $3,000 

The MSU-Pontotoc Mississippi Sweet Potato Clean Plant Program will receive $165,000 through the  National Clean Plant Network  , which is a program to target plant pathogens and pests to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. specialty crop producers. 

The funding derives from mandatory funding in the farm bill and is administered by USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), chair of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, today issued the following statement regarding President Biden’s 11th-hour illegitimate attempt to declare the 1970s-era Equal Rights Amendment ratified as part of the U.S. Constitution: 

“President Biden’s pandering ERA declaration doesn’t hold any legal weight but does fall in line with the many instances over past four years when his administration blatantly ignored the rule of law – whether we’re looking at pro-life issues, school loans, or the border. 

“The law is clear that the deadlines to ratify the ERA are long past. Not only is Biden speaking against his own administration’s OLC memo on this issue, but his statement also contradicts all legal decisions coming from the courts. The ERA simply hasn’t weathered the test of time. Its ratification today would unleash a lot of unintended consequences that would, in reality, hurt women and girls.” 

Hyde-Smith actively worked to stop an unconstitutional effort in 2023 to have Congress declare the ERA ratified.

Hyde-Smith Cosponsors Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025, Authorizes Lease Sales for the Next Decade 

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is cosponsoring legislation to authorize renewed offshore oil and natural gas leasing in American waters, which would be a departure from Biden administration efforts to severely limit future production in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025  (S.109), introduced Thursday by U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), requires the U.S. Department of the Interior to hold two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years. The legislation is intended to provide greater certainty, particularly since 2024 was the first time in 50 years that no lease sales were made in the Gulf of Mexico. 

“Offshore energy production in the Gulf of Mexico is vital to our economic and national security,”  said Hyde-Smith.  “The Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025 will help ensure that our resources are being properly managed to better the lives of Mississippians and the nation by unleashing American energy dominance.” 

Both Hyde-Smith and Cassidy serve on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which conducted a  confirmation hearing  for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to be the next Secretary of the Interior. Asked by Hyde-Smith about offshore energy production, Burgum said, “Getting lease sales to be regular, predictable, and at a level that allows us to maintain energy production in our country is a minimum standard.” 

In addition to mandating sales, S.109 also defines acreage, stipulates lease terms and conditions, defines which previously-finalized environmental reviews will apply to the sales, and ensures that both issued leases and drilling permit applications are not either invalidated, remanded, or delayed as a result of civil litigation. The bill also codifies President Trump’s 2020 memorandum to withdraw the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from leasing for the duration of the legislation. 

The bill is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.). The American Petroleum Institute (API), National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), Gulf Energy Alliance (GEA), and Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) are among the groups supporting this legislation.

Miss. Senator Signals Readiness to Move Long-Sought Flood Control Project to Construction 

  
VIDEO: Senator Hyde-Smith Celebrates ‘Record of Decision’ Signing for Yazoo Backwater Pumps  . 

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today celebrated the signing of a Record of Decision (ROD) that clears the way for the construction of a long-sought flood control project for the Yazoo Backwater Area—a goal the Senator has fought for since disastrous flooding in the South Delta in 2019. 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Vicksburg District  released  the signed ROD for the Yazoo Backwater Study Area on Friday, putting in place the legal means for the Army Corps to proceed with the preconstruction, engineering and design phase of the flood control project initially authorized by Congress in 1941 for a 630,000-acre region of the South Delta. 

“The people of the South Delta who have waited decades for flood protection can do a little jig today because we can now move from shuffling papers and studies to getting shovels in the ground. There are still years of work and a lot of funding needed to ‘finish the pumps,’ but we’re in the best position we’ve ever been in to bring the Yazoo Backwater pumps into reality,”  Hyde-Smith said. 

“A lot of agencies had to agree to get to the Record of Decision, but the people of Mississippi most affected by flooding deserve good credit for their patience and fortitude over the years to push the government to provide the protection promised them decades ago,”  Hyde-Smith added.  “This is a solid win and I am ready to do everything I can as a Senator to find the resources needed to push this project over the finish line.” 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last week  formally signaled  that the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  released in November  is not subject to the 2008 and 2021 Clean Water Act 404(c) vetoes that  scuttled  earlier efforts to advance the Yazoo Backwater Area project. 

The EPA determination allowed the Army Corps to issue the ROD to move forward with the new plan developed in coordination with EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The final EIS involves installing pumps to provide flood risk reduction for all communities in the Yazoo Backwater Area and securing mitigation to minimize impacts to wetland resources. 

Hyde-Smith, serving on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the Army Corps, is working to secure passage of the  FY2025 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill  that has Yazoo Backwater Area funding she worked to include.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today welcomed the prospect of a sea change in leadership at the U.S. Department of the Interior as President-elect Trump’s nominee committed to carrying out the incoming administration’s goal of U.S. energy dominance. 

Hyde-Smith serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which conducted a  confirmation hearing  on North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum’s nomination to be Secretary of the Interior, a position that will influence offshore energy projection and heritage protections in Mississippi. 

“Doug Burgum is incredibly capable of leading the Interior Department, and I am eager for his ability to implement a pro-energy, pro-America agenda as Secretary,”  Hyde-Smith said following the hearing. 

Hyde-Smith, who has  consistently fought  the Biden administration’s mismanagement of offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, questioned Burgum on whether the Interior Department would develop a new five-year plan governing such sales. 

“Offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, of course, plays a vital role in Gulf States’ economies,”  Hyde-Smith said.  “It is important that the Department maintain a steady leasing schedule to ensure companies can continue the opportunities to explore for new production to support affordable and reliable energy... Will it be a priority for Interior to develop and finalize a new five-year plan?” 

Burgum responded that assuring the nation’s future would require energy dominance, which includes more energy production. 

“Getting lease sales to be regular, predictable, and at a level that allows us to maintain energy production in our country is a minimum standard,”  Burgum said.  “The fact that during the current administration, the lease sales have been unpredictable and disruptive, and the fact that they’re projecting forward to have among the fewest we’ve ever had, almost would guarantees we would see a decline in energy production in the years ahead because of the lead times.” 

Hyde-Smith also sought Burgum’s commitment to support ongoing public-private projects to enhance visitors’ experiences at the Vicksburg National Military Park and Natchez National Historical Park  sites  . She also extended an invitation for Burgum to visit the state. 

“William Faulkner once said, ‘To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.’ We’re very blessed with several National Park Service and several sites in Mississippi that contribute to our tourism and the economy of our state. We work closely with them through public-private partnerships,”  Hyde-Smith said.  “We want to make sure that continues.” 

Burgum said  he appreciated the invitation, adding, “We need to take care of these sites whether historic or others. We have to make sure they’re capable of handling the visitors who want to see them. We know they are great for the local economy.” 

Burgum’s nomination requires an affirmative vote from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee before it can be referred to the full Senate for confirmation.

11:04:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: Q: What are you doing to stop human trafficking?    
  
A:  Although it’s hard to believe human trafficking and forced labor exists in the 21st century, these horrible crimes take place right underneath our noses, even in rural America. Over the years, I’ve learned that children, runaways, foster youth and migrants are targeted for illicit sex trafficking and forced labor. This issue comes up during my  annual 99 county meetings  .   
  
For decades, I’ve worked to help raise public awareness about human trafficking and  shape public policy  that provides support services for survivors, strengthens enforcement and boosts prevention measures to protect the most vulnerable people in society from these crimes. From using the  federal tax code  to go after those who make money in the underground economy by selling sexual access to girls and women, to making sure money provided from the  Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act  was flowing into the  Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund  , as intended, I leave no stone unturned to root out these crimes against humanity and restore hope and healing to survivors. However, during the Biden administration, this situation has sadly gotten even worse.   
  
Iowans raised concerns with me about migrant children who have been exploited and lost during the Biden administration. That’s why I’ve led congressional oversight of the Biden administration’s failed policies and mismanagement of federal programs for migrant children who come into the country without an adult guardian. My oversight exposed glaring gaps and safety risks to these kids;  federal records revealed how the federal government has failed to prevent sponsors from exploiting unaccompanied minors entrusted to their care.    
  
My office worked closely with whistleblowers to identify as many missing children as possible, in hopes they can be found and saved. I’ve kept up the drumbeat,  convening an oversight roundtable in Washington  last summer to expose wrongdoing and urge federal agencies to do their jobs and protect these children from trafficking and abuse. According to reports, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services couldn’t reach more than a third of the unaccompanied children it had placed in the custody and protection of sponsors since the start of the Biden administration. What’s worse, whistleblower disclosures showed evidence of children placed in the hands of likely traffickers, despite clear red flags. Despite my  repeated warnings to federal authorities  , the Biden administration failed to take action to prevent these children from falling into the wrong hands. In January, I resumed my chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where I’ll continue pushing to fix the failed Biden administration policies that put tens of thousands of migrant children in harm’s way. In fact, one of the first bills I joined in introducing this Congress was the  PRINTS Act  to empower law enforcement to identify victims of child trafficking.   
  
Q: How can people report concerns or seek help?    
  
A:  Raising public awareness about these unspeakable crimes is step one. Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world, robbing  more than 27 million people of their freedom  , with criminal networks profiting tens of billions of dollars annually. Educating people in the community to look out for potential human trafficking crimes will help save lives and root out bad actors taking advantage of vulnerable kids, teenagers and migrants exploited for human trafficking. People working on the front lines of the hospitality, transportation and travel industries are in a unique position to be eyes and ears on the ground to help law enforcement and government officials respond more effectively.   
  
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) advises people working in the transportation sector, as well as the traveling public, to recognize and report potential trafficking crimes. The DOT launched its  #PutTheBrakesOnHumanTrafficking  initiative to train transit employees and educate the public about suspicious behaviors that may indicate human trafficking. Clues to look for include: a potential victim’s responses appear scripted or rehearsed; signs of physical abuse; a potential victim is closely monitored and appears submissive or fearful. The public is encouraged to immediately alert law enforcement about a trafficking situation.   
  
If an individual has escaped a trafficking situation, organizations are available to help with shelter, medical care, legal assistance and other services. The national human trafficking hotline operates 24/7 at (888) 373-7888 or text HELP to BeFree (233733). The Iowa Victim Service Call Center is (800) 770-1650, or text IOWAHELP to 20121.   
  
To report suspicious criminal activity, contact the 24-hour tip line, operated by trained specialists at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations, at (866) DHS-2-ICE/ (866) 347-2423. Iowans may also use an anonymous reporting tool online found at  StopHTIowa.org  , operated by the Iowa Office to Combat Human Trafficking at the Iowa Department of Public Safety.   
  
January is  National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention and Awareness Month  .

11:04:28 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today joined Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) in launching the bipartisan Inspector General (IG) Caucus. The IG Caucus will support federal watchdogs in their efforts to ensure government accountability and compliance with the law. 

“Inspectors General play an essential role in protecting taxpayer dollars and rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the executive branch,”  Grassley said  . “I rely heavily on these independent watchdogs when carrying out my constitutional responsibility of oversight, and I’m glad to join Senator Ernst’s effort to support their invaluable work.” 

“Inspectors General serve a vital role in uncovering waste in Washington and must be empowered to continue looking out for taxpayers,”  Ernst said  . “From identifying billion-dollar boondoggles to exposing a federal workforce that is permanently out of office, their work has been invaluable in my decade-long mission to uncover waste and make Washington squeal. I look forward to this caucus continuing to allow IGs to do tremendous work and find more ways to downsize government and eliminate inefficiencies.” 

Background: 

Congress in 1978 established Offices of Inspectors General at various federal agencies to serve as “independent and objective units” within the federal government. IGs are responsible for: conducting audits and investigations; promoting efficiency; deterring fraud and abuse; and fully informing agency heads and Congress about interagency problems. 

Last Congress, Grassley  introduced  bipartisan legislation to safeguard Offices of Inspectors General from partisan political activity and  demanded  they continue fortifying protections for whistleblowers. Grassley also played a key role in the 2016 passage of the  Inspector General Empowerment Act  , which included his language to ensure IGs receive timely access to all records necessary for conducting oversight.

Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee 

Hearing on “The Nomination of the Honorable Pamela Jo Bondi to be Attorney General of the United States: Day 2” 

Thursday, January 16, 2025 

Good morning, everybody. Welcome back for our second day of the hearing on Ms. Bondi’s nomination for Attorney General. As I said yesterday, I want everyone to be able to watch the hearing without obstruction. If people stand up and block the views of others behind them, or if they speak out of turn, it’s not fair or considerate to others, so officers will remove individuals, as they have previously. 

Before we begin with opening statements from the panel, I want to go over a couple of housekeeping items and explain how we are going to proceed today. 

I will give an opening statement and introduce the majority witnesses, and I will give the opportunity for Senator Durbin to provide an opening statement and introduce the minority witnesses. Then we will turn to our witnesses for their opening statements. Following their statements, we will begin with the first round of questions, in which each Senator will have five minutes. 

Yesterday, we met here from 9:30 until about 3 p.m. so that every Senator, both Democrat and Republican, could question Ms. Bondi. 

We heard from Senators Scott and Schmitt, who gave their strong endorsement of Ms. Bondi. Their introductions described her extensive experience, outstanding qualifications and character. 

Yesterday’s testimony showed that Ms. Bondi is certainly experienced and capable to serve as our nation’s chief law enforcement officer at this critical time. She is very well qualified for the position—she served for 18 years as a prosecutor and eight years as Attorney General of the state of the Florida, the third most populous state in our country. She will enact desperately needed changes at a Department that has been politicized and weaponized to partisan ends. With almost 30 years of experience behind her, she will restore both morale and law and order to a Department badly in need of strong leadership. Her commitment to the rule of law emerged as a central themes of our discussion yesterday. And as I made clear in my opening statement, that is what I believe the Department and this country desperately needs. 

Today, the purpose is to hear from an outside panel of witnesses, and we are grateful that they are here with us this morning. 

I will go ahead and introduce the three majority witnesses, before I turn it over to Ranking Member Durbin to provide opening remarks and to introduce the minority witnesses. 

First, is Mr. Dave Aronberg. Until just a few days ago, Mr. Aronberg was the elected Democrat State Attorney for Florida’s 15th Judicial Circuit. He served in that role for three terms since he was elected in 2012. Mr. Aronberg also previously served in the Florida State Senate, and as a White House Fellow in both the Clinton and Bush administrations at the Treasury Department. He has known Ms. Bondi since 2010, when he ran to be the Attorney General of Florida—a position Ms. Bondi ultimately won. Notwithstanding their political differences, Ms. Bondi appointed Mr. Aronberg to be her “Drug Czar” to combat the opioid epidemic, and through that work he came to know Ms. Bondi well. 

Second, we have Mr. Nicholas Cox, who is Florida’s longest-serving Statewide Prosecutor. He has served in that role since 2011. In his capacity as statewide prosecutor, Mr. Cox focuses on cases involving human trafficking, drug abuse, fraud, organized crime, gang violence, cybercrimes and crimes against seniors. Mr. Cox also previously served as a member of the faculty at Stetson University College of Law, where he taught trial advocacy, consumer law, counseling and negotiation, and criminal procedure. Mr. Cox has extensive experience observing Ms. Bondi’s work as a lawyer and administrator. Ms. Bondi began her legal career as an intern in his office and, while serving as Attorney General, she appointed him to his current office. 

Third, we have Sheriff Emery Gainey, a career law enforcement officer with more than 40 years of experience. Sheriff Gainey has served as the Sheriff of two counties in Florida. When Ms. Bondi served as Attorney General, he served as her director of law enforcement and director of victim services. Through his work as a law enforcement officer in Florida, Sheriff Gainey is very familiar with Ms. Bondi’s work with state, local and federal law enforcement, as well as her work to address drug abuse, fight human trafficking, and help victims of crime. 

I now turn to Senator Durbin for his opening remarks, and to introduce the minority witnesses.

11:04:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a senior member and former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, today spoke with Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent about the importance of reducing sky-high spending, protecting whistleblowers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and responding to congressional oversight. 

Video and excerpts of his questions follow. 

VIDEO 

Debt and Deficits are a Spending Problem 

“My Democrat colleagues believe the only solution to our unsustainable debt and deficits is higher taxes on job creators and families. However, history proves that high tax rates fail to raise significant revenues. Taxpayers, workers and investors are smarter than we are. We’ve had a 93-percent marginal tax rate—then 70 percent, 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent and so on. But, regardless of the rate, we’ve brought in about the same amount of revenue. 

“On the other side of the ledger, federal spending is at levels we’ve never seen outside of war and recession – and still growing. 

“Isn’t it true that our fiscal imbalance is primarily a spending problem, not a revenue problem?” 

IRS Whistleblower Program 

“While I oppose tax hikes on individuals, families and small businesses, I’ve long championed sensible policies geared toward shutting down tax loopholes and providing tools to the IRS to detect tax cheats. 

“A prime example is the IRS whistleblower law I authored in 2006, which has brought in over $6 billion to the Treasury. This program could raise billions more if used by the IRS to its full potential. 

“Should you be confirmed, can I count on you to be supportive of the whistleblower program and work to ensure it’s used to its full potential?”

11:04:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:04:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and author of legislation that  strengthened  the  False Claims Act  , is urging the United States Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the constitutionality of the law’s critical  qui tam  provision, which allows whistleblowers to bring lawsuits against fraudsters on behalf of the federal government and share in any recoveries. 

“The  False Claims Act  is our nation’s single greatest tool to fight waste, fraud and abuse,”  Grassley said  . “As the author of the 1986 amendments to the  False Claims Act  , I’m strongly urging the Eleventh Circuit to reverse the lower court’s flawed decision and uphold the constitutionally-sound  qui tam  provision. By protecting and empowering whistleblowers who shine a light on wrongdoing, the  False Claims Act  , with its  qui tam  provision, has recovered over $78 billion – a massive victory for taxpayers.” 

Grassley’s amicus brief specifically discusses the  Zafirov v. Florida Medical Associations  decision, which dismissed a  qui tam  action under the  False Claims Act  on the basis that the  qui tam  provision is unconstitutional. 

In response, Grassley argues that: 

  * Qui tam  provisions were enacted during the First Congress by the Framers of the Constitution and are deeply embedded in the United States’ constitutional history; 
  * Every court that has addressed this issue has concluded that the  qui tam  provision is in accordance with the Constitution; and 
  * The  False Claims Act  , strengthened by the  qui tam  provision, is an effective tool to fight fraud, deter would-be fraudsters, and protect the public from harm. 



Read Grassley’s amicus brief  HERE  . 

Background: 

Grassley in 1986 updated the  False Claims Act,  the law enabling the government to recover taxpayer dollars from entities that defrauded federal agencies. A key provision in that update,  qui tam  , allows whistleblowers to sue alleged fraudsters on behalf of the government and share in any recoveries. Since then, the  False Claims Act  has recovered over  $78 billion  in taxpayer dollars. 

Despite the  False Claims Act  ’s overwhelming success, courts and defendants have attempted to mischaracterize and weaken the law. In June 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision  upholding  the plain text and congressional intent of the law to hold accountable individuals who knowingly defraud the government. Grassley also filed an  amicus brief  in that case.

Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee 

Hearing on “The Nomination of the Honorable Pamela Jo Bondi to be Attorney General of the United States” 

Wednesday, January 15, 2025 

Good morning. I want to welcome everyone to this very important hearing to consider the nomination of former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as the 87th Attorney General of the United States. Congratulations on your nomination, Ms. Bondi, and thank you for your willingness to serve. 

I want to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership as Chairman of the Committee for the last four years. Although he and I have many differences on policy, we’ve worked well together on many issues over the years. As he steps into the role of Ranking Member of the Committee, I look forward to working closely with him to serve the American people. 

I’d also like to welcome the new Members to this Committee, Senators Britt, Schmitt, Crapo and Schiff. I look forward to working with each of you. 

Before we get started, I want to set out a couple ground rules. I’m going to handle this hearing using a similar structure to how Chairman Durbin handled the nomination hearing of Attorney General Garland. I want everyone here to be able to watch the hearing without obstruction. If people stand up and block the view of those behind them, or speak out of turn, it’s not fair or considerate to others, so officers will immediately remove those individuals. 

Now, before I turn to my opening statement, let me explain how we're going to proceed today. 

I’ll give my opening remarks, and then I’ll invite Ranking Member Durbin to give opening remarks. Then I’ll call on Senators Scott and Schmitt to introduce the nominee. Following those introductions and Ms. Bondi’s statement, we’ll begin the first round of questions. Each Senator will have an initial seven-minute round for questions. After the first round, we’ll do a second, four-minute round of questions. I ask Members to do their best to adhere to these time limits, so that we can proceed efficiently with the hearing. 

With that, I’ll turn to my opening remarks. 

We’re here today to consider the nomination of Pam Bondi to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. 

Ms. Bondi—thank you for being here today. You’re nominated to one of the most important offices in our country, and it took a lot just to get here today. The more than 14,000 pages of records, hundreds of hours of media files, and more than 3,400 responsive entries you disclosed to this committee are a testament to your long career in the public eye and your cooperation with this Committee. I’d also like to thank your family for coming. I know some of them traveled to be here and I know they are very proud of you. 

I’d like to say at the beginning of this hearing, that I expect Ms. Bondi to be treated fairly by my colleagues. 

During Attorney General Garland’s confirmation hearing, Republicans treated him with respect, asked tough but fair questions, and ultimately voted him out of committee on a bipartisan basis. Although Attorney General Garland wasn’t who we would’ve chosen to lead the DOJ, we recognized that President Biden won the election, and that he was entitled to choose his Attorney General. 

We were ultimately greatly disappointed with Attorney General Garland, but we gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

As the recent terrorist attacks in New Orleans and around the world have shown, our national security is a high priority. The American people deserve a secure homeland and borders, safe streets, orderly markets, civil rights, and a protected environment. Delivering on these promises requires the swift confirmation of an Attorney General. This Committee should give Ms. Bondi the same benefit of the doubt it gave AG Garland. 

President Trump has selected a nominee whose qualifications speak for themselves. Ms. Bondi made history in 2010 as the first woman elected to be Florida Attorney General. She held this role for eight years, from 2011 to 2019, and was comfortably reelected by the people of Florida in 2014 to a second term. 

Eight years of service as the Attorney General of the third largest state in the Union is excellent preparation for the role of Attorney General of the United States. As the Florida Attorney General, Ms. Bondi was a member of the Florida cabinet, the chief legal officer for the State, and led a large agency that tangibly impacted people’s lives. And by all accounts, Ms. Bondi handled her responsibilities well. 

As the Florida Attorney General, Ms. Bondi achieved numerous successes. She engaged in key initiatives to fight human trafficking, counter the opioid epidemic, protect consumers, and protect the citizens of Florida from violence. 

She didn’t shy away from hard work or complicated problems. She engaged in an aggressive campaign to eliminate pill mills, took a leading role in securing a $3.25 billion settlement following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and eliminated the backlog of rape test kits that had accumulated in state laboratories. 

Ms. Bondi’s experience isn’t limited to her service as Florida Attorney General. She also served as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County for 18 years and prosecuted terrible crimes. She sought tough penalties and justice for victims of violent criminals, domestic abusers, and sexual predators. She prosecuted drug traffickers, and helped protect her community. She was also active outside of her professional role, serving in the Junior League of Tampa, on the board of the Special Olympics Florida, and she is well-known for her animal rescue efforts. 

Her experience and performance as Attorney General, prosecutor, and community leader speak volumes about her character and her dedication to the rule of law. She’s received multiple letters in support of her nomination, including from the Fraternal Order of Police, the Republican State Attorneys General, more than 100 former senior DOJ officials, and a bipartisan group of former state attorneys general. 

In short, Ms. Bondi’s a highly qualified choice. And change is desperately needed. 

When confirmed, Ms. Bondi will take the helm at a turbulent time. The Justice Department’s infected with political decision-making, while its leaders refuse to acknowledge that reality. 

Crossfire Hurricane was a textbook example of government weaponization. 

That FBI investigation was built on the fake Steele Dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton Campaign who worked with foreign operatives. 

My investigative work  exposed that the FBI knew the dossier was false information and was likely part of a Russian disinformation campaign. 

Even with knowledge of the dossier’s defects and political infection, the Justice Department sought FISA warrant renewals and took other actions. 

After directing my oversight staff to investigate the Justice Department’s mishandling of the matter, the Justice Department retaliated by issuing a subpoena for their phone records. 

Then, a few of my Democratic colleagues pressured the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force to supposedly brief me and Senator Johnson relating to our Biden family investigation. 

In August 2020, Senator Johnson and I had that infamous briefing from the FBI. 

Later, its contents were leaked to the media even though the FBI had promised confidentiality. 

That leak falsely labeled our oversight work as – you guessed it – Russian disinformation. 

To this day –  over four years later  – the Intelligence Community and FBI refuse to provide us the intelligence basis for that briefing. 

The title of this  Wall Street Journal  article sums it up, “The FBI’s Dubious Briefing: Did the bureau set up two GOP Senators at the behest of Democrats?” 

I know what government weaponization is. 

And then we get to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his lawfare operation. 

It involved an unprecedented FBI raid on Trump’s house, including agents that even searched the former First Lady’s clothing drawers. 

Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden certainly didn’t receive the same treatment by the government regarding their records. 

Indeed, as my oversight exposed, the FBI amazingly agreed to destroy laptops and records associated with Clinton’s staff. 

This Orwellian conduct should have no quarter. 

On top of it all, FBI Special Agent Thibault, the anti-Trump agent that violated the Hatch Act for political activity on the job, started one of Jack Smith’s cases. 

But, Jack Smith wasn’t the only Department official who tried to influence this past election. 

The  Washington Post  reported last August about a previously undisclosed Mueller investigation into Trump that was closed for lack of evidence and it being a “fishing expedition.” 

That news reporting was based on sealed court records, government records, and potentially classified information roughly 90 days before the last presidential election. 

The Justice Department leaked that information to the press to impact the election against President Trump. And they did it while stiff-arming congressional requests for information that would prove embarrassing to the Biden-Harris administration. 

Let us not forget some of the other flagrant abuses of power that we’ve seen from the DOJ and the FBI over the last four years: 

  * The DOJ used the might of the Federal Government to prosecute individuals peacefully praying outside of abortion clinics. 
  * The FBI suggested that traditional Catholics could be domestic terrorism threats, claiming that these individuals adhere to “anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT and white supremacy ideology.” 
  * The FBI opened dozens of investigations into parents who voiced their concerns at school board meetings regarding curriculum choices and COVID-19 mandates. 
  * The FBI applied undue pressure to social media platforms to censor so-called “misinformation,” downgrading or removing flagged social media posts and removing users. 



These are only a few particularly egregious examples of the rot infesting the DOJ. The impact of this political infection in our once-storied law enforcement institutions is catastrophic. 

By every metric, the Biden-Harris Justice Department’s conduct has failed to live up to our Country’s ideals. 

Ms. Bondi, should you be confirmed, the actions you take to change the Department’s course must be for accountability, so that the conduct I just described never happens again. 

The only way to accomplish that is through transparency for Congress and the American People. 

With that, I’ll turn to Ranking Member Durbin for his opening remarks.

11:04:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Judiciary Committee member Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) in introducing a bill to protect vulnerable migrant children by boosting security measures at the southern border. 

“Over the last four years, child exploitation at our nation’s southern border has exploded. This humanitarian crisis is a direct result of the Biden administration’s open border policies,”  Grassley said  . “The  PRINTS Act  would empower law enforcement to identify victims of child trafficking and stamp out this horrific abuse. Congress must act quickly to protect vulnerable children and begin to undo the damage of the Biden administration.” 

“Under President Biden’s open border policies, we are witnessing a devastating humanitarian crisis, and children are the primary victims,”  Blackburn said  . “Abusing and using a child again and again is one of the most heinous acts imaginable, and yet it happens every day along the southern border. Empowering border patrol agents to fingerprint non-citizens under the age of 14 would give them the tools they need to identify victims of child recycling and stop this abuse in its tracks. Given that the Biden administration carelessly lost track of 85,000 migrant children, passing this legislation could not be more critical.” 

The  Preventing the Recycling of Immigrants is Necessary for Trafficking Suspension (PRINTS) Act  would: 

  * Authorize Customs and Border Patrol to fingerprint non-citizens under the age of 14; 
  * Require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to publicly report the number of apprehensions involving child traffickers who falsely claim an accompanying child is a relative; 
  * Require DHS to submit an annual report to Congress identifying the number of fingerprinted minors; 
  * Remove the U.S. Attorney General’s authority to waive fingerprinting requirements for individuals illegally crossing the nation’s border; and 
  * Criminalize child recycling. 



Additional cosponsors include Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 

Find bill text  HERE  . 

Background: 

Last Congress, Grassley  exposed  the Biden administration’s Unaccompanied Children (UC) program for allowing tens-of-thousands of migrant children to be lost or handed over to potential traffickers and criminals. Grassley additionally  shared evidence  with federal law enforcement to alert them of potential child trafficking and smuggling cases facilitated by the UC program.

11:04:57 root         DEBUG    Desc: ######  Beyond Tariffs, Bennet Recommends his Bipartisan Americas Act to Boost Beneficial Trade, Reshore Manufacturing, and Safeguard National Security 

Washington, D.C.  — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet wrote to members of the incoming Trump administration including U.S. Department of State Secretary-designate Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary-designate Scott Bessent, U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary-designate Howard Lutnick, National Security Advisor-designate Representative Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), and U.S. Trade Representative-designate Jamieson Greer to call for a comprehensive approach to international economic policy that goes beyond President-elect Donald Trump proposed tariffs. 

“Targeted tariffs can be an important tool to combat unfair trade practices that undermine our ability to manufacture critical products at the necessary economies of scale. But indiscriminately wielding tariffs and other punitive policies would likely raise costs for Americans and fail to fully address the challenges facing our country,”  wrote Bennet.  “As you help President-elect Donald Trump craft his international economic policy, I write to encourage you to consider a comprehensive strategy beyond his proposed tariffs that includes additional policies to drive broad-based American growth, increase domestic and regional capacity, and protect U.S. national and economic security.” 

In his letter, Bennet emphasizes that imposing sweeping tariffs will likely raise costs for Americans and not solve the challenges facing the United States. He calls on the administration to pursue supportive domestic policies like the  CHIPS and Science Act  and  Inflation Reduction Act  – historic legislation passed under the Biden-Harris administration – and supportive international policies like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) signed under the previous Trump administration. 

Additionally, he urges the incoming administration to pursue trade agreements and programs that advance U.S. interests – such as securing U.S. access to critical materials and competing with China. Specifically, Bennet highlights his and U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.)’s bipartisan  Americas Act  , which would build upon the USMCA to drive shared economic prosperity, strengthen democracy in our hemisphere, counter the influence of China and Russia, and address some of the causes of migration. 

“America cannot meet today’s challenges by building barriers and going it alone,”  concluded Bennet.  “I look forward to discussing these issues with you and stand ready to work with President-elect Trump’s administration to advance trade policies that serve the American people.” 

The text of the letter is available  HERE  and below. 

Dear Sen. Rubio, Mr. Bessent, Mr. Lutnick, Rep. Waltz, and Mr. Greer: 

As you help President-elect Donald Trump craft his international economic policy, I write to encourage you to consider a comprehensive strategy beyond his proposed tariffs that includes additional policies to drive broad-based American growth, increase domestic and regional capacity, and protect U.S. national and economic security. Strengthening our economic relationships with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) – among other regions – will increase U.S. economic dynamism, reinforce critical supply chains, deliver greater prosperity and opportunity for the American people, and tackle the problems of migration at their root. 

Targeted tariffs can be an important tool to combat unfair trade practices that undermine our ability to manufacture critical products at the necessary economies of scale. But indiscriminately wielding tariffs and other punitive policies would likely raise costs for Americans and fail to fully address the challenges facing our country. These tools have an important role to play, but you must match them with supportive domestic and international policies. 

These domestic policies include the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act, which continue to spur American manufacturing, support cutting-edge innovation, and ensure the United States leads the world in emerging technology. International policies include those President-elect Trump pursued during his first term, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the América Crece initiative to facilitate prosperity and security in the LAC region, the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, and productive trade talks with India. 

But the United States must do more. We should pursue trade agreements and programs that serve U.S. economic and strategic interests – such as securing U.S. access to critical materials and competing with China in regions and sectors with national security importance. Unfettered trade has not and will not serve Americans’ interests. Trade, like tariffs, must be one instrument among many we must use to solve specific challenges, such as countering China’s dominance in critical sectors and securing essential supply chains. 

One way to implement this strategy close to home would be through my and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA)’s bipartisan and bicameral Americas Act – which would boost mutually-beneficial trade between the United States and LAC countries, bring manufacturing back to the United States and the Western Hemisphere, counter China’s economic coercion of LAC governments, and create pathways to economic security that stem illegal migration and transnational criminal organizations’ ability to recruit and inflict violence. 

To ensure the U.S. continues to lead in the twenty-first century, trade policy must consider protective measures that foster domestic capacity and prevent illicit trade activities while also offering positive frameworks for increased cooperation with key allies and partners. America cannot meet today’s challenges by building barriers and going it alone. 

I look forward to discussing these issues with you and stand ready to work with President-elect Trump’s administration to advance trade policies that serve the American people.

11:04:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: ######  Studies  Show That Negative Health Effects Can Persist Months After Exposure to Wildfire Smoke 

Washington, D.C.  — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet reintroduced the Cleaner Air Spaces Act (CASA) to reduce the negative health effects caused by wildfire smoke in vulnerable communities. U.S. Representative Scott Peters (D-Calif.) will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The legislation would provide grants to expand local clean air programs that provide free air filtration units to households and establish  clean air centers  in communities with a high risk of wildfire smoke exposure. Vulnerable populations, such as infants, the elderly, and people with pre-existing health conditions such as respiratory or cardiovascular disease, are at  higher risk  of negative health effects from wildfire smoke. 

“Coloradans know too well how harmful wildfire smoke is to their long-term health and quality of life,”  said Bennet  . “As wildfires have become more frequent and destructive, like those devastating Los Angeles, we need to give our most vulnerable communities the means to protect themselves and their families from the lasting damage of toxic smoke.” 

“The wildfires in Los Angeles are another reminder of how far-reaching the public health implications of wildfire smoke are,”  said Peters  . “Catastrophic wildfires, driven by decades of poor land management and a warming planet, are now the single largest source of particulate pollution in the United States, and in 2020 California wildfires released more CO2 than the state’s entire power sector. California cities like San Diego are leading the way with programs to provide air filtration units, air monitors, and clean air centers for communities at risk of this dangerous pollution. This bill will help vastly expand these vital programs to meet the challenge of protecting at-risk communities from more extreme wildfires.” 

Wildfires are now the largest source of particulate pollution in the United States, creating more than  40%  of the nation’s fine particulate matter air pollution. Particulate pollution from wildfire smoke is  more harmful  to human health compared to other pollution sources and tens of millions of Americans are at  risk  of experiencing high levels of exposure. Extreme smoke events are already  increasing  emergency room visits and more people will be at risk as wildfires grow in frequency and intensity. 

Clean air rooms are one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce negative health effects from wildfire smoke. A clean air room is a designated space set up to keep levels of smoke and other harmful air particles as low as possible during wildfire smoke events. Clean air rooms can be established inside a household (e.g., a bedroom) or established via a community clean air center (e.g., a clean air space in a library or a gym). 

The Cleaner Air Spaces Act would: 

  * Provide grants to support local cleaner air spaces programs. The programs must: 
    * provide at least 1,000 free air filtration units and one replacement filter for the air filtration units to low-income households with individuals vulnerable to wildfire smoke; 
    * provide educational materials to help eligible households best utilize the air filtration unit and create a clean air room in their home; 
    * establish at least one public clean air center. 
  * Require grant recipients to partner with local organizations. 
  * Require a report to Congress with survey data from the cleaner air spaces programs and recommendations on if and how the programs should be modified or expanded. 



Statements of Support 

“Recognizing the most devastating impacts of wildfires are felt by those directly in the fire’s path, wildfire smoke can also affect communities hundreds of miles away,”  said Laurie Anderson, Field Organizer, Moms Clean Air Force Colorado Chapter  . Residents along the Front Range, where wildfire smoke tends to linger, have experienced days when the air quality is some of the worst in the world. While many of us can retreat to safe rooms in our homes with windows closed and air filters running around the clock, some of the most vulnerable families with infants, the elderly, or those with underlying health conditions, simply can’t afford the protection they need. That’s why we support the Cleaner Air Spaces Act (CASA). Everyone deserves protection from wildfire smoke, and we thank Senator Bennet for introducing this crucial legislation.” 

“Moms in Colorado are unfortunately all too familiar with the realities of wildfire smoke and the dangers it presents to our children’s developing lungs,”  said Sara Kuntzler, Colorado State Director, Mountain Mamas  . The fires in LA are a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities we are all facing as climate change makes wildfires both more severe and unpredictable. While we work to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis, we must provide safe places for kids when the air outside is dangerous, which this important legislation will do.” 

“This legislation will provide an opportunity for agencies to create clean air spaces which the community can use during smoke events, said Tom Gonzales, Larimer County Public Health Director. It will additionally provide a means to distribute air filtration units to persons most in need when wildfire smoke events are occurring, providing important public health protections.” 

“The reintroduction of the Cleaner Air Spaces Act (CASA) by Senator Bennet and Rep. Peters addresses one of the most urgent challenges of our time: the health and safety threats posed by the climate crisis,”  said Beatriz Soto, Protégete Director, Conservation Colorado  . With wildfires becoming more frequent, larger, and more devastating, CASA is a critical measure to protect our communities. Latinos and other communities of color are disproportionately impacted, living closer to wildfire-prone areas and facing greater health risks from smoke exposure. This legislation centers equity by providing clean air spaces, free air filtration systems, accessible information and community clean air centers to protect families and vulnerable populations. CASA reflects an essential commitment to protecting those who bear the greatest burden of the climate crisis, ensuring everyone has access to the tools and resources needed to breathe clean air and thrive.” 

“Wildfires are growing more furious and unpredictable, as we’re seeing with the deadly firestorms ravaging Los Angeles. And the harm these fires cause doesn’t end when the last ember is extinguished,  said Joanna Slaney, Associate Vice President of Political Affairs, Environmental Defense Fund  . Millions of Americans are being exposed to dangerous air pollution because of wildfire smoke. Even just a few days of exposure to wildfire smoke can have harmful health consequences, especially for children and older adults. Sen. Bennet and fellow congressional clean air champions have put forward a thoughtful plan to ensure that families can get to safety and avoid dangerous air pollution amid ever-worsening wildfires.” 

This legislation is also supported by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative. 

In addition to Bennet and Peters, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and U.S. Representatives John Garamendi (D-Calif.), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.), Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Dina Titus (D-Nev.), and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.).

11:04:58 root         DEBUG    Desc: ######  Funding Supports Rural Electric Cooperatives, Agricultural Producers, Small Businesses, and Other Rural Entities in the Transition to Clean Energy 

Washington, D.C. — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet celebrates nearly $3.4 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s  Empowering Rural America  (New ERA) program,  Powering Affordable Clean Energy  (PACE) program, and  Rural Energy for America Program  (REAP) since the passage of the  Inflation Reduction Act  to help lower energy costs for rural Colorado. This funding helps electric cooperatives, farmers, and small businesses modernize rural energy infrastructure and invest in affordable and reliable clean energy projects. These investments include $3.2 billion from the New ERA program to modernize rural electric co-op energy infrastructure, $134 million from the PACE program to develop renewable energy production and energy storage projects, and over $28 million from REAP to help agricultural producers and rural small businesses purchase and install clean energy systems or make energy efficiency improvements. This funding was provided by the roughly $13 billion investment in rural clean energy Bennet helped secure in the  Inflation Reduction Act  (IRA), the largest investment in rural electrification since the 1930s. 

“Colorado’s rural electric co-ops are central to our state’s clean energy transition, and set the standard for the rest of the country,”  said Bennet  . “These investments will ensure our farmers, businesses, and rural communities continue to lead the way as we make good on our promises to cut pollution, spur growth for rural economies, and deliver reliable, affordable energy.” 

New ERA is a $9.7 billion program created in the  IRA  that helps rural electric cooperatives transition to clean, affordable, and reliable energy. PACE is a $1 billion program also created in the  IRA  that provides partially forgivable loans to help various entities invest in clean energy projects. REAP is a long-time program that received an additional $2 billion in funding through the  IRA  to provide financing to agricultural producers and rural small businesses to help install clean energy projects or make energy efficiency upgrades. 

Bennet championed the roughly $13 billion in funding for rural electrification through USDA’s clean energy programs in the  Inflation Reduction Act.  In addition, he helped secure  direct pay provisions  in the  IRA  that allow rural electric cooperatives, public power companies, Tribes, and other entities without tax liability to access clean energy tax credits for the first time. In December 2022, Bennet  pushed  USDA to swiftly roll-out USDA rural clean energy funds from the  IRA.  In May 2023, Bennet  joined  USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and Biden administration leaders at the White House to announce nearly $11 billion in rural clean energy grants and loan opportunities – including $9.7 billion through the New ERA program. In December 2023, he  pushed  USDA to ensure  IRA  clean energy funding for rural electric cooperatives reached Colorado. In October 2024, Bennet  joined  U.S. Representatives Yadira Caraveo and Brittany Pettersen, USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small, and leaders from Colorado rural electricity cooperatives to welcome more than $2.5 billion in low-cost financing and grants from the New ERA program to support Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association’s clean energy transition.

11:04:59 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:04:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet introduced three amendments to the Laken Riley Act, legislation now moving through the Senate to require mandatory detention of undocumented individuals if they have been charged, accused, or arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. The legislation also authorizes state attorneys general to sue the federal government for decisions or alleged failures related to immigration enforcement. 

“Immigration reform is long overdue in this country and should build on individual rights, not strip them,”  said Bennet  . “This legislation in its current form burdens families, local economies, courts, and law enforcement without any support for the existing challenges they face. Including these amendments would ensure we respect the right to due process and move towards a humane, commonsense immigration system in this country.” 

Bennet’s first amendment excludes individuals granted or eligible for DACA status and children 16 years of age and under from the mandatory detention provisions of the Laken Riley Act by preserving existing federal, state, and local due process protections for minors and Dreamers who commit crimes. Custody provisions explicitly would not apply to these groups. 

Bennet’s second amendment includes his  Affordable and Secure Food Act  and the Dream Act to address immigration and labor challenges.   
  
Specifically, this amendment would: 

  * Reform the H-2A program to allow year-round visas and wage stability; 
  * Strengthen worker protections and introduce nationwide E-Verify; 
  * Provide pathways to legal status for agricultural workers and their families after 10 years of labor; 
  * Expand access to affordable housing for farmworkers and rural Americans; 
  * Establish a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship for individuals brought to the U.S. as children; and 
  * Enhance access to higher education and employment opportunities. 



Bennet’s third amendment would address constitutional concerns and resource efficiency in the Laken Riley Act by modifying mandatory detention provisions and eliminating problematic clauses. 

Specifically, this amendment would: 

  * Remove provisions granting state attorneys general standing to sue the federal government over immigration policies; 
  * Revise Mandatory Detention provisions to apply only to individuals convicted of crimes, not merely arrested or charged, and focus on serious bodily injury crimes (e.g., DUI with injury or death) and theft-related convictions; 
  * Protect detained minors by clarifying no mandatory detention for individuals under 16 and ages 17-18, detention is allowed only if the individual poses a danger to the community or is a flight risk; and 
  * Amend Due Process and Resource Allocation by clarifying that aliens detained longer than three months must receive a custody hearing before an Immigration Judge. 



These amendments build on Bennet’s work with Democratic and Republican colleagues to advocate for commonsense immigration reforms that support our economy, keep families together, and secure our border to combat drug, arms, and human trafficking. In addition, Bennet is focused on strengthening our response to the surge in migrant arrivals, protecting immigrant children, and ensuring timely support and federal funding for communities hosting migrants, including in Colorado.

11:05:01 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:05:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet along with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called on the Biden administration to stop rushing trade negotiations behind closed doors. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is attempting to change at least three major trade agreements without sufficient Congressional consultation, while sacrificing valuable leverage that USTR could use to secure wins for American farmers and workers. 

“Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation,”  wrote the senators  . “USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies.” 

USTR is seeking changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) by the end of the presidential term. The senators warned that making concessions to trading partners would sacrifice leverage to make progress on a number of U.S. priorities. In USMCA negotiations, for example, USTR should use any available leverage to address Canada’s unfair dairy policies and taxes on digital services. USTR should also push to resolve the United States’ many outstanding concerns with Colombia, including corn and dairy market access. 

“Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred,”  continued the senators. 

In November 2024, Bennet and Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) led a bipartisan, bicameral  letter  to USTR Katherine Tai and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack expressing concern about reports that Colombia may pursue a misguided investigation into U.S. corn subsidies, which could result in severe restrictions on U.S. corn exports to Colombia. Bennet voted for 2020 legislation to implement USMCA, which brought U.S. trade policy into the 21st century, ensured access to key export markets for Colorado and provided some certainty for our farmers and ranchers. Bennet also voted for 2011 legislation to implement the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, which further opened the Colombian market for exports of American corn and dairy, among other products. 

Bennet and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) are also the lead sponsors of the  Americas Act  , a bipartisan and bicameral bill that would build upon the USMCA to drive shared economic prosperity, strengthen democracy in our hemisphere, counter the influence of China and Russia, and address some of the causes of migration. The  Financial Times  Editorial Board  , retired U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander General  Laura Richardson  , Dominican Republic President  Luis Abinader  , Uruguayan President  Luis Lacalle  , and Costa Rican Trade Minister  Manuel Tovar  have all endorsed the bill. 

In addition to Bennet, Crapo and Wyden, U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) also signed this letter. 

The text of the letter is available  HERE  and below. 

Dear President Biden: 

We write to express significant concerns with the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) lack of transparency and consultation regarding its efforts to negotiate binding interpretations of congressionally approved trade agreements. Trade policy works best for all Americans when all Americans—and their elected representatives in Congress—have a say in its development. We urge your administration to engage in meaningful and comprehensive consultations with Congress and stakeholders prior to moving forward on these negotiations with foreign trading partners. We also strongly urge USTR to push for the resolution of offensive trade concerns that are in the U.S. interest as part of any negotiations. 

As has been reported, USTR is seeking binding interpretations of certain investment obligations in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. These interpretations would govern the legal rights of stakeholders under the agreements and specify how disputes should be adjudicated. Given Congress’s constitutional authority over trade and the legally binding nature of these interpretations, it is critical that USTR meaningfully consult with Congress and stakeholders in a timely manner, prior to and during any efforts to negotiate legal text with trading partners. 

Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation. USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies. Member offices’ access to the text has been limited because of USTR’s confidentiality designations for trade documents, which have been unclear, inconsistent, and potentially inappropriate. The agency has failed to establish a process for taking or considering Member feedback, and it does not seem that USTR has consulted with the U.S. stakeholders who would be directly affected by these actions. Despite these concerns, USTR has since shared text with trading partners and is forging ahead with multiple initiatives in this space. Without adequately consulting on the USMCA text, USTR has moved forward with new text under the Colombia trade agreement, and we have recently heard that USTR may be seeking to propose similar text with respect to the Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). 

Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders are critical to ensuring that affected companies and their workers understand what is being proposed and how it may impact operations at home and abroad. Additionally, proper consultations would help ensure that USTR considers the broader context in which any of these negotiations would be undertaken. Given that USTR’s proposed interpretations would have the most significant impact on U.S. companies, which have brought the most investment-related claims under these agreements, our trading partners may view these proposed interpretations as a benefit to them. We question why USTR has not attempted to leverage this dynamic to secure wins for the United States on our offensive trade issues with the countries in question. For example, USTR should use any available leverage in USMCA conversations to address Mexico’s illegal fishing practices and discriminatory energy measures, as well as Canada’s unfair dairy policies and digital services taxes. Similarly, with respect to Colombia, the United States has a litany of outstanding trade concerns, including labor standards and worker rights, dairy and corn market access, and auto regulations. Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. 

To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred. To be clear, that has not happened. 

We thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Washington, D.C.  — Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper celebrated $20 million in additional Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve 12 airports across Colorado. 

“These investments will help airports improve safety and expand capacity to get Coloradans where they need to go,”  said Bennet.  “It is another example of how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law keeps delivering for our state.” 

“Colorado’s airports drive our economy and connect our state,”  said Hickenlooper.  “These Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments will strengthen our economy and make air travel both easier and safer.” 

The investments are funded through the FAA’s  Airport Infrastructure Grants (AIG) program  , which delivers funding for airports nationwide to make necessary infrastructure improvements. The program receives funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which  has provided over $518 million to Colorado airports since being signed into law.

The inauguration of a president from any party should not be used as an opportunity for personal enrichment or cronyism. My legislation will ensure that inaugural committees are held to appropriate standards of transparency and accountability.” 

Senator Cortez Masto  first introduced  this legislation following reports that President Donald Trump’s first inaugural committee—which raised nearly $107 million—misused funds, and she has reintroduced it every Congress. 

Under current law, there are few rules that govern inaugural committees. Donations to the committee of $200 or more must be disclosed 90 days after the inaugural period, but there are no disclosure requirements for committee expenditures. Additionally, there are no reporting requirements on how leftover funds are used after the inaugural period. Specifically, the  Inaugural Committee Transparency Act  would: 

  * Require an inaugural committee to disclose to the FEC the name and address of every person to whom any disbursement of $200 or more is made and the purpose of the disbursement; 
  * Prohibit donations on behalf of another person; 
  * Prohibit converting donations to personal use; 
  * Require that any remaining funds be donated within 90 days of the inaugural ceremony to a 501(c)(3) charity. 



The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).  The full text of the legislation can be found  HERE  . 

Senator Cortez Masto has long championed  actions to crack down  on dark money in politics  . Recently, she  sent  a letter to the 2025 Trump Vance Inaugural Committee requesting information on the Committee’s practices for identifying and screening out illegal and anonymous foreign donations. She has cosponsored  legislation  to require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors and help guard against hidden foreign influence in our democracy.

11:05:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: Cortez Masto’s bipartisan, bicameral bill would provide relief for Nevada taxpayers who have experienced natural disasters including those impacted by the Davis Fire 

Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) introduced bipartisan legislation Senators John Kennedy (R-La.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) to provide relief for impacted taxpayers in states that have issued state-level disaster declarations. Currently, the IRS has the authority to postpone filing deadlines in the event of a presidentially-declared federal disaster, but this does not extend to state-level emergencies. Representatives David Kustoff (R-Tenn.-08) and Judy Chu (D-Calif.-28) have introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Each year, the state of Nevada declares state-level emergencies for disasters like flooding and wildfires. In 2023, the Davis Fire in Reno burned nearly 6,000 acres, destroyed 14 homes and businesses, and caused week-long evacuations for thousands of Nevada residents. Under current law, Nevadans impacted by this fire, and other state-level disasters, are not eligible for any tax relief because the fire was declared a disaster only at a state level and not also declared by the President of the United States. Cortez Masto’s legislation would ensure that states get the support they need to recover from natural disasters. 

“Nevadans experiencing natural disasters deserve tax relief, regardless of whether the state receives a federally recognized disaster declaration,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “My bipartisan, bicameral bill would ensure that Nevada taxpayers impacted by wildfires, winter storms, floods, and more have the financial flexibility they need to recover.” 

“Louisianians have worked tirelessly to rebuild after historic storms took their toll, so giving them the time they need to file taxes after a natural disaster is a no-brainer. Since Louisiana can’t always rely on Washington to get us the relief we need when we need it, this bill would make sure that Louisianians get tax extensions that are crucial for recovering after our state declares a natural disaster. I’m glad to partner again with Sen. Cortez Masto on this effort,”  said Senator Kennedy  . 

“When disaster strikes, the burden families face on the long road to recovery is overwhelming. This bipartisan bill provides financial flexibility for Americans impacted by disaster so they can focus on rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,”  said Senator Van Hollen  . 

“When a disaster like Hurricane Helene hits, the last thing Tennesseans should have to worry about is meeting a tax-filing deadline,”  said Senator Blackburn.  “The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act empowers the governor to extend tax deadlines, giving Tennesseans the flexibility to focus on disaster recovery.” 

The  Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act  would allow the governor of a state or territory to extend a federal tax filing deadline in the event of a state-declared emergency or disaster, which happens automatically for federally-declared disasters. Extending this authority to states gives them the ability to provide relief independent of the federal government’s involvement in an emergency or natural disaster. The legislation would also expand the mandatory federal filing extension from 60 days to 120 days. 

Senator Cortez Masto is committed to ensuring Nevadans have access to resources in the face of natural disasters that threaten the state. Cortez Masto has worked to deliver funding to help  improve  the  resiliency  of state infrastructure and is  leading  legislation protect electric grids at military bases and  rural water utilities  from the effects of extreme weather. The  Inflation Reduction Act,  which she helped pass, includes legislation she  personally negotiated  to combat drought in the states bordering the Colorado River and address the wildfire crisis. She also secured key provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which  provided billions  to fund wildfire prevention efforts in Nevada.

11:05:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Today, U.S.Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) announced $3.1 million to support efforts by the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species at Lake Tahoe. This funding comes from the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  , which both Cortez Masto and Rosen voted to pass. 

“Lake Tahoe has special significance for Nevadans, Tribes, and visitors alike, and I will always work to preserve its natural beauty,”  said Senator Cortez Masto.  “I’m proud to have secured more funding to protect the lake from invasive species, and I will continue working to keep resources coming to the Tahoe Basin.” 

“Lake Tahoe is one of Nevada’s natural wonders, and it’s our responsibility to protect it,”  said Senator Rosen.  “This funding will help fight the spread of invasive species, restore areas in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and safeguard it for generations to come. I’ll always fight to support the Basin with the federal resources it needs.” 

This funding supplements a total of $17 million in grants the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support Lake Tahoe’s conservation, restoration, and resilience. The grant will advance efforts to combat Lake Tahoe’s invasive species, including the Eurasian watermilfoil, an invasive weed that disrupts aquatic ecosystems and outcompetes native plants. 

Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen have been champions for Nevada’s great outdoor spaces and public lands. They passed critical legislation to  permanently fund  the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which protects public lands in Nevada and across the U.S. Cortez Masto  passed  bipartisan, bicameral legislation to restore Lake Tahoe, which Rosen supported, and both senators delivered  critical funding to protect Lake Tahoe  in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Cortez Masto and Rosen also helped pass the historic  Great American Outdoors Act  , which was signed into law and provides robust funding to preserve and maintain public lands across the country. In 2020, Senator Cortez Masto also  created  the Invasive Species in Alpine Lakes Pilot Program to protect lakes like Lake Tahoe.

11:05:13 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Today, U.S.Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) announced that the U.S. Commerce Department has approved Nevada to invest over $416 million that she  secured  to expand access to high-speed internet for households across Nevada. This is the final step in a years-long effort to finalize this funding that Senator Cortez Masto helped deliver through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  The Senator specifically worked to ensure Nevada would receive more funding by pushing the administration to  update  their National  Broadband Map  to accurately reflect the state’s broadband needs. 

“This critical funding I’ve helped deliver to connect Nevadans in all corners of our state will be a gamechanger for so many households who still lack access to high-speed internet,”  said Senator Cortez Masto.  “Thanks to the support provide by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, more Nevadans, both rural and urban, will be able to get online to stay in touch with loved ones, complete their education, and grow their businesses.” 

The BEAD program is an initiative designed to help close the digital divide by expanding access to high-speed internet in underserved and unserved areas. This grant funding will be used to support planning, infrastructure development, and adoption programs to expand high-speed internet access to over 50,000 households in Nevada. 

As part of her  Innovation State Initiative  , Senator Cortez Masto has led efforts to improve broadband access and strengthen Nevada’s economy. She successfully called for increased accountability for federal broadband programs through efforts like the  FCC broadband  map which helped deliver the State of Nevada additional funding through more accurate broadband accessibility data. The Senator has also pushed for greater transparency and tracking of federal broadband dollars through her bipartisan  mapping tool  she created in the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . She also passed her bipartisan  ACCESS Broadband Act  to establish an office in the Commerce Department that administers  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  funding, provides technical assistance to communities, and tracks taxpayer dollars.

11:05:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) helped reintroduce the  No Tax on Tips Act  to exempt tipped wages from federal income tax. Nevada has the  highest  concentration of tipped workers in the nation, and all cash and non-cash tips are currently subject to federal taxes. This bipartisan legislation will allow workers to keep their tips without paying federal income tax on them. 

“  Working families in Nevada deserve a break, and this bipartisan bill will put more money in their pockets.,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “This is one part of my comprehensive work to lower costs for working families and deliver for Nevadans across the state.” 

The bill exempts “cash tips”—cash, credit and debit card charges, and checks—from federal income tax by allowing taxpayers to claim a 100% deduction at filing for tipped wages. The updated text includes guardrails to ensure only traditionally tipped employees will benefit from  No Tax on Tips.  The legislation is cosponsored by Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.).  . 

Senators Cortez Masto has consistently supported efforts to cut taxes and lower costs for hardworking Nevadans. Senator Cortez Masto also helped introduce the  Working Families Tax Relief Act  to lower taxes for Nevada families by expanding the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. Additionally, Senator Cortez Masto supports raising the federal minimum wage and eliminating the minimum wage gap for tipped workers nationally. Nevada is one of seven states that already requires employers to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage rather than a sub-minimum wage.

“I urge Republican leadership to work in a bipartisan manner on this and find solutions that will benefit all Americans, not just CEOs and their board members.” 

Washington, D.C. –  U.S. Senator Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) took to the Senate floor today to call out Congressional Republicans working to extend President-elect Donald Trump’s massive tax giveaway for billionaires in a way that will hurt middle class families in Nevada and across the country. Cortez Masto highlighted that she led her Democratic colleagues in a  letter  to Republican leadership urging them to work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize this legislation in a way that reduces the deficit and protects hardworking Americans. 

Below are her remarks as prepared for delivery: 

M. President, I’m joining my colleagues on the Senate floor today to drawing attention to what really is happening here in Washington that has an impact on our individuals and families back home. 

You know, quite often I see so many decisions being made here in this bubble in Washington without any true regard or understanding of the impact on Main Street, where we all live and we come from. And what we’re talking about today, is that Donald Trump’s massive tax giveaway to billionaires is about to expire, and many of my Republican colleagues want to extend the bill at the expense of middle-class families across the country. 

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says reauthorizing the Trump tax bill as-is would add $4.6 trillion to our national debt. That would raise interest rates and make it more expensive for families to buy a home, send their kids to college, or start a business. 

Based on how much my colleagues across the aisle have spent the last four years talking about our deficit, I would hope they would want to avoid adding trillions of dollars to it, regardless of who is in the White House. 

Unfortunately, that doesn’t appear to be the case. 

Instead, my Republican colleagues have come up with two options for selling this legislation, that will mainly benefit the very wealthy in this country, to the American people. 

Let’s start with the first option. Republican leadership in the Senate has suggested that because they want to extend policy that currently exists, we should just ignore the cost of extending it. That $4 trillion increase in our deficit just doesn’t exist. 

I know we all wish we could forget about the national debt sometimes, but that’s not what the American people sent us here to do, and that’s not what the American people do. I can tell you, every family across this country has to live within their means and manage their budget. My family, my grandparents, my parents, everybody. So we should be working together to address this issue. 

The other option for reauthorizing the Trump tax bill as-is comes from House Republicans, who have suggested gutting Medicaid in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. I can’t stress this enough. Again, tax breaks for the very, very wealthy. The top 1%. On the backs of working families, on the backs of our middle class. 

That’s just outrageous. 

Padding the pockets of the top 1% at the expense of hardworking families is unacceptable, and my Democratic colleagues and I will not stand for it. 

I urge Republican leadership to work in a bipartisan manner on this and find solutions that will benefit all Americans, not just CEOs and their board members. There’s a way we can come together to make sure our middle class benefits. 

Let’s come together and build on spending reductions from the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act instead of targeting Americans’ health care. And let’s ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share to protect the middle class and their children from the exorbitant $5 trillion bill the Republicans are currently planning to send them. 

Because I’ll tell you, the two options Republicans have come up with on their own don’t work for the people of Nevada. 

But there is an option that works. I’m going to stress it one more time. This should not be a partisan issue. This should not be done just through reconciliation without any input from the Democrats. Because at the end of the day, our families are no different. Our communities are no different. 

My firefighters in Nevada and are no different than the firefighters in your state. My hardworking laborers in my state, whether they come from the service industry and it’s somebody who is washing dishes in a restaurant in Nevada, is no different than that person washing dishes in some of my colleagues’ states. 

Everybody benefits if we come together in a bipartisan way. Democrats are ready to do what we were elected to do and find bipartisan solutions that benefit all Americans. I hope my Republican colleagues will start this Congress off on the right foot and work with us to reduce the deficit and craft a tax policy that will promote the middle class.

11:05:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Senator Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) reintroduced the bicameral  Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act.  This legislation would guarantee state, tribal, and local officials are given a meaningful voice in the decision-making process when a nuclear waste repository is proposed in their community. Representatives Dina Titus (D-Nev.-01), Steven Horsford (D-Nev.-04), and Susie Lee (D-Nev.-03) have introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

“I’ve said for years that Washington shouldn’t have the unilateral authority to make decisions that will impact communities and the environment in the Silver State for generations to come,”  said Senator Cortez Masto  . “Nevadans have made it clear, Yucca Mountain is dead. This legislation will give local and Tribal leaders the seat at the table they deserve in decision-making about nuclear repositories in their communities – in Nevada and across the country. I will continue to fight to make sure Nevadans’ voices are heard.” 

“Over more than three decades and at every step in the process, the Yucca Mountain project has faltered because Nevadans do not want nuclear waste stored in our state,”  said Representative Titus  . “We must codify this opposition into law to protect the health and safety of our communities and guarantee a process that requires the consent of state, local, and tribal leaders. Nevada is not a nuclear waste land. We don’t produce nuclear waste, and we shouldn’t be forced to store it.” 

“Nevadans have been overwhelmingly clear in their opposition to making Nevada the nation’s nuclear waste dumping ground,”  said Senator Rosen.  “This legislation will ensure that states like Nevada have a say in opposing the storage of nuclear waste in their backyard. I’ll always fight against Washington’s efforts to bring nuclear waste to our state.” 

“Nevadans will not stand by at attempts to make our state a nuclear dumping ground,”  said Representative Horsford  .  “Our public health is on the line; our environmental safety is on the line; our ability to feel secure in our communities is on the line – so our voices will not be silenced. I’m proud to cosponsor the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act to require local consent for any attempt to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, and I will always work to prevent this ill-conceived project from moving forward.” 

“Nevada has made it clear for decades that we refuse to become the nation’s nuclear dumping ground,”  said  Representative Lee.  “This bill ensures that nuclear waste projects, like Yucca Mountain, cannot move forward without consent from the communities they affect. I’ll continue fighting against attempts to revive Yucca Mountain.” 

The  Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act  is based on recommendations from Department of Energy’s (DOE) 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future and DOE’s 2017 consent-based siting report. Accordingly, this bill would require that the Secretary of Energy secure written consent from the following entities before moving forward with a nuclear waste repository: 

  1. Governor of the host state 
  2. Affected units of local government 
  3. Each contiguous unit of local government primarily affected by the repository 
  4. Affected Tribes 



Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen, along with Representatives Titus, Horsford, and Lee, have all fought to ensure Yucca Mountain remains dead. These members of the Nevada delegation successfully  fought the  Trump Administration’s early efforts to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, by preventing funds from being included for the failed site in every final appropriations bill during the Trump Presidency. She also personally  negotiated  a deal  with the DOE to remove the weapons-grade plutonium that was secretly shipped to Nevada. Following  continued  advocacy  from the Senator, DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration recently completed the removal four years  ahead of schedule  .

First, Senator Cortez Masto asked Mr. Wright to acknowledge that the failed Yucca Mountain project is unworkable.  Mr. Wright acknowledged the need for input on long-term nuclear waste disposal, but  he refused to condemn nuclear storage at Yucca Mountain or acknowledge the project is dead. 

“President Trump has said he doesn’t support waste [disposal] at Yucca Mountain, so let me ask you again because you didn’t really answer the question. Can Nevadans count on you to acknowledge that the failed Yucca Mountain project is unworkable,” Cortez Masto asked again.  Even  after  acknowledging that Nevada opposes the dumping of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Mr. Wright would not specifically commit to opposing the project. 

Senator Cortez Masto then asked Mr. Wright about the Department of Energy’s (DOE) role in protecting our national security. Despite calling the DOE’s role in protecting our national security his “single biggest concern”, Mr. Wright would not commit to pushing back on the incoming Trump Administration should they propose cuts to critical funding to the Nevada National Security Site. 

The Senator also urged Wright and the incoming administration to continue to support DOE programs created through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  and the  Inflation Reduction Act  that fund workforce development, cybersecurity improvements, and clean-energy innovation that is happening in Nevada. 

Finally, Senator Cortez Masto and Mr. Wright discussed the importance of an all-of-the above strategy to grow the domestic energy supply that includes wind, solar, and other forms of clean energy.  “The conversation we’re going to continue to have around energy is important, and it should be balanced. It is not just focused on fossil fuels, no matter what some of my colleagues say. There should be a balanced approach to our energy portfolio,”  said Senator Cortez Masto.

11:05:48 root         DEBUG    Titles: Kennedy on Fox News: Congress should unwind Biden's disastrous energy policies to restore the American economy
11:05:48 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-18
11:05:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: MADISONVILLE, La. – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today penned  this op-ed  for Fox News outlining how Congress can dismantle the harmful energy policies President Biden put in place to help the Trump administration restore our economy and address inflation. 

Key excerpts of the op-ed are below: 

“If congressional Republicans intend to deliver on our promises of a booming economy and stable prices, we’d be wise to unwind quickly the disastrous energy policies that the Biden-Harris regime imposed on one of America’s most essential industries. 

“President Biden is using his final days in office to rub salt in the wounds of the American energy sector. Most recently, the Biden-Harris administration implemented yet another offshore drilling ban on more than 625 million acres of American coastline. He used an obscure 1953 law to prohibit all future leases in the restricted coastal areas, making it extremely difficult for the incoming Trump administration to reverse course. 

“Not only is President Biden ignoring American voters by forcing through another harmful energy policy after his party lost the White House, but he is also making it more difficult for President Trump to restore the American economy and ease inflation.” 

. . . 

“The only way our country will crawl out from under President Biden’s high prices is if our economy grows rapidly, but we know that high energy prices slow economic growth. 

“President Trump will need every tool at his disposal to restore American energy independence and lay the foundation for the future. Congress can help. We should demand that the Department of Interior approve more lease sales, especially offshore. The department is supposed to adhere to a schedule of at least two lease sales each year. The Biden-Harris administration didn’t hold any lease sales last year. 

“Existing federal regulations also prolong the permitting approval process and cripple LNG and oil producers. Congress can reform the bureaucratic permitting process to reduce unnecessary judicial overview and make reviews concurrent rather than consecutive.” 

. . . 

“It is going to take an all-hands-on-deck effort to unwind all of President Biden’s destructive energy policies, and Congressional Republicans should stand ready to take the handcuffs off American energy.”

11:05:51 root         DEBUG    Titles: Kennedy, Cortez Masto introduce legislation to help Louisianians recover from natural disasters
11:05:51 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:05:51 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today joined Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) in reintroducing the Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act to provide relief for taxpayers in states that have issued state-level disaster declarations. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the authority to postpone tax filing deadlines following a presidentially declared federal disaster but not following the declaration of a state-level emergency. 

“Louisianians have worked tirelessly to rebuild after historic storms took their toll, so giving them the time they need to file taxes after a natural disaster is a no-brainer. Since Louisiana can’t always rely on Washington to get us the relief we need when we need it, this bill would make sure that Louisianians get tax extensions that are crucial for recovering after our state declares a natural disaster. I’m glad to partner again with Sen. Cortez Masto on this effort,”  said Kennedy. 

The Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act would allow the governor of a state or territory to extend a federal tax filing deadline following a state-declared emergency or natural disaster instead of waiting for a federal disaster declaration. This means that states would have the ability to provide federal tax extensions independent of the federal government’s involvement in an emergency or natural disaster. 

The bill would also expand the mandatory federal filing extension from 60 days to 120 days. 

“Nevadans experiencing natural disasters deserve tax relief, regardless of whether the state receives a federally recognized disaster declaration. My bipartisan, bicameral bill would ensure that Nevada taxpayers impacted by wildfires, winter storms, floods, and more have the financial flexibility they need to recover,”  said Cortez Masto. 

Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) also cosponsored the bill.

11:05:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) joined Sens. Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in re-introducing the VA Home Loan Awareness Act, which would help educate veterans about the benefits available to them through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Program. 

“Our veterans gave so much to protect the American Dream, and we can help them as they work to achieve it themselves. Congress should pass this bill to make sure our brave warriors know about the home loan benefits they’ve earned,”  said Kennedy. 

“For decades, owning a home has been the bedrock of the American Dream, but too often, those who have put their lives on the line for our country have been hampered by a lack of information from their own government. I’m proud to join Senator Van Hollen and my other colleagues in introducing this commonsense measure to empower our veterans with the knowledge and resources necessary to secure a VA Home Loan and achieve the same dream they fought to defend,”  said Sheehy. 

“After serving our country in uniform, our veterans deserve the support of a grateful nation. The VA Home Loan Program is one way we provide that support—by helping veterans purchase homes. But far too many of our veterans are unaware of this program and what it has to offer. Our bipartisan bill will help ensure more veterans and their families have the opportunity to use it to achieve their goal of homeownership,”  said Van Hollen. 

The VA Home Loan Program offers benefits for veterans financing their home purchases, including no down payment, no private mortgage insurance and lower interest rates than conventional Federal Housing Administration loans. 

Currently, just 13% of veterans use their VA Home Loan benefit. The legislation would: 

  * Add a disclosure on the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) to inform veterans of their potential eligibility for a VA Home Loan. 


  * Direct applicants to consult their lenders for more information about the VA Home Loan Program. 


  * Instruct the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review and report to Congress regarding lenders’ adoption of the URLA form updates.

11:05:54 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:05:54 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Jim Banks (R-Ind.) in introducing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. 

“When an infant clings to life after an abortion procedure, doctors have a duty to care for that child. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would protect these defenseless boys and girls. There’s no reason Congress should delay in sending it to the president’s desk,”  said Kennedy. 

“No child should be denied medical care simply because they are ‘unwanted.’ Today, if an abortion procedure fails and a child is born alive, doctors can just ignore the crying baby on the table and watch them slowly die of neglect. That’s not an abortion, that’s infanticide,”  said Lankford. 

“I've always fought to defend the unborn and will continue to do so in the Senate. It's unconscionable that we even need such a law, but it's essential to protect the most vulnerable among us. Now that Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress and the most pro-life President in my lifetime, we have the opportunity to see this important bill signed into law,”  said Banks. 

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require health care providers to preserve the lives of infants who survive an abortion with the same care they would give to any other child born at the same gestational age. The bill would also require health care providers to transport the infant to a hospital. 

The bill would also: 

  * Require health care workers to report failures to provide proper care to born-alive infants to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 


  * Penalize anyone who fails to provide proper care to born-alive infants with a fine or imprisonment.

11:06:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and colleagues in introducing Sarah’s Law to help make sure U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains and removes illegal immigrants who kill or seriously injure Americans. 

“Because of unfettered illegal immigration, Sarah Root, Laken Riley and other innocent Americans aren’t alive today. We need to pass Sarah’s Law to make sure we protect our communities from violent illegal immigrants,”  said Kennedy. 

Sarah’s Law would: 

  * Require ICE to take into custody illegal aliens charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. 


  * Direct ICE to attempt to identify victims of violent crimes at the hands of illegal aliens and inform their families of the criminal’s name, country of nationality, immigration status, criminal history and custody status. The bill would also require ICE to inform the victim’s family of any efforts to remove the alien from the U.S. 



“Sarah Root had her entire life ahead of her before it was senselessly taken by someone who never should have been in this country. Her family has been forced to endure a living nightmare without closure because a glaring loophole in the law has allowed her killer to remain on the run for nearly nine years. For years, I have worked tirelessly to pass Sarah’s Law to honor her memory, hold illegal immigrants that cause bodily harm to our citizens accountable, and ensure this never happens again. I will not give up this fight for justice, because our laws should not prioritize illegal immigrants over the safety of Americans,”  said Ernst. 

Sarah’s Law is named after Sarah Root, a 21-year-old girl whom an illegal alien killed when he drove drunk. Sarah’s Law would help strengthen federal law so that criminal aliens like Root’s killer would stay behind bars.

11:06:01 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today reintroduced the Reinforce Occupancy Obligations for Maximized Interagency Efficiency (ROOMIE) Act to establish in-person work requirements for employees of federal agencies. The bill would also direct federal agencies to make efficient use of their office space. 

“It’s past time that employees of federal agencies work in person. Right now, bureaucrats are wasting office space and Americans’ tax dollars. The ROOMIE Act would save money by demanding efficiency and hard work from federal employees,”  said Kennedy. 

The ROOMIE Act would: 

  * Require each federal agency to make sure that at least 80% of its employees work in-person from Monday through Friday of each week. 


  * Direct federal agencies to use at least 60% of their office space or give up that space so that a private business could purchase or re-lease it for more efficient purposes. 



Background: 

  * A  review  by the Government Accountability Office found that 17 federal agencies used, on average, 25% or less of the office space they owned or leased. 


  * The General Services Administration (GSA)  found  that, when federal agencies underutilize government buildings, the buildings may pose health risks. In several federally controlled buildings, GSA found legionella, a bacterium that can cause infections and death. Legionella can spread easily when water is stagnant because remote workers have left buildings largely unoccupied.

WASHINGTON, DC –  Senator James Lankford (R-OK) questioned Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent during a Senate Finance Committee hearing today about restoring American energy independence and creating a stable permanent rate for bonus depreciation. 

Lankford has long been a supporter of all-of-the-above domestic energy policies and stabilizing bonus depreciation rates. Research from the  American Petroleum Institute  has shown that a 100 percent bonus depreciation could support up to 1,400 miles of new pipelines, which would further support the incoming Trump Administration’s energy production agenda. 

Excerpt 

Lankford  :  On the energy side, you’ve talked a lot about energy production. But I’m an Oklahoman, and unashamedly, we’re ‘all-the-above-and-all-the-below’ on energy. We probably have more wind and hydro and solar production in my state than any other state on this dais, with very few exceptions. But we also use oil and gas. And we’re going to produce all the energy that our state needs to be able to make sure that we stay stable on that. One of the issues that is a business issue for small or large businesses that I’ve been fighting for is a stable bonus depreciation amount. This is not about the type of energy or the type of business even. It’s if you’re actually investing in your company and trying to grow your company, that you would know what that bonus depreciation is. Now this will help with pipeline productions, but it will also help a pet shop, hair salon, and a restaurant, just as much as well. And so, thoughts on bonus depreciation and just a stable rate for that? 

Bessent  :…  So I think that increasing the after-tax return on capital for US companies, especially small business, is one of the greatest forms of job creation that we could see. And they are, to go back to your point on energy production, we’ve heard much here today saying that we are at a record amount of energy production, and we know that’s a canard. We are barely above where we were in 2020. And if we were to look at the Department of Energy projections for 2024 and 2025, we are well below those. The past four years we have seen US production constrained and part of a fulsome sanctions program would mean that we need more energy production in the US to make up for the loss of sanctioned Russian oil to protect the US consumer.

11:06:05 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC –  Senator James Lankford (R-OK) introduced the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  to protect newborns that survive abortions by requiring they receive care from health care practitioners. 

“No child should be denied medical care simply because they are ‘unwanted.’ Today, if an abortion procedure fails and a child is born alive, doctors can just ignore the crying baby on the table and watch them slowly die of neglect. That’s not an abortion, that’s infanticide,”  said Lankford. 

In 2002, Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act which codified in law that a newborn, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, is to be legally recognized as a person from the moment of birth if he or she show any sign of life. The 2002 law did not provide any measures to enforce the protection of these infants, which has allowed the current practice of leaving a child to die after a botched abortion to continue. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act adds clear expectations of care, hospital transfer requirements, mandatory reporting, private rights of action for moms, and reasonable criminal penalties for health care professionals who violate the law. 

The legislation was cosponsored by Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senators Jim Banks (R-IN), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Katie Britt (R-AL), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Roger Wicker, R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ted Budd (R-NC), Tim Scott (R-SC), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Curtis (R-UT), Todd Young (R-IN), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Barrasso (R-WY), John Kennedy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Mike Lee (R-UT), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Dave McCormick (R-PA). 

March for Life Action, AAPLOG Action, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Concerned Women for America LAC, National Right to Life, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Live Action, Americans United for Life, Family Research Council, Students for Life Action, Alliance Defending Freedom, US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Heritage Action, Family Policy Alliance, Human Coalition, Liberty Council Action, Ethics and Public Policy Center, Christian Employers Alliance, Advancing American Freedom, Focus on the Family, First Rights Global, AdvanceUSA, Coalition for Jewish Values, National Association of Evangelicals, Eagle Forum, Christian Legal Society, Christian Medical and Dental Associations, Faith and Freedom Coalition, Christ Medicus Foundation, Christians Engaged, Children’s AIDS Funds International, Capability Consulting, and Catholic Health Care Leadership Alliance endorsed this legislation. 

“I’ve always fought to defend the unborn and will continue to do so in the Senate. It’s unconscionable that we even need such a law, but it’s essential to protect the most vulnerable among us. Now that Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress and the most pro-life President in my lifetime, we have the opportunity to see this important bill signed into law,”  said Banks. 

“Babies who are born alive after an attempted abortion deserve the same protection and medical care that would be afforded to any other newborn,”  said Thune  . “This commonsense bill is a basic standard of decency, and there’s no reason why it shouldn’t receive overwhelming bipartisan support.” 

“Every baby born alive, no matter the circumstances of their birth, deserves the appropriate medical care necessary for a fighting chance to live. This measure is a critical step in ensuring these vulnerable infants are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and I fully support this life-affirming legislation,”  said Hyde-Smith. 

“The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act ensures that every child that survives an attempted abortion receives the proper medical care and attention from healthcare professionals. Allowing a child to suffer and die on a medical table without interventions is not who we are as Americans. I will keep fighting for a child’s right to life,”  said Risch. 

“Every single life is worthy of protection, especially the unborn,”  said Lummis  . “There is nothing controversial about providing life-saving medical aid to infants who survive abortions, and I am partnering with my colleagues to protect every abortion survivor’s right to life.” 

“The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is a commonsense bill that would protect the most vulnerable babies. I will continue to be a voice for the voiceless, fight to defend life, and support mothers and families across our nation,”  said Britt. 

“Protecting children who are born alive because of a failed abortion should not be up for debate,”  said Blackburn.  “These innocent babies deserve the highest quality of care, and our legislation would stand up for these infants who cannot stand up for themselves.” 

“The Born Alive Infants Protection Act affirms a fundamental commitment to the sanctity of life by ensuring that any infant born alive, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, is afforded the same rights, protections and medical care as any other human being. This legislation underscores our shared humanity and our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable among us,”  said Crapo. 

“All babies – born and unborn – deserve the same standard of care and compassion. That ought to be non-negotiable. I’ll never stop standing up for the most vulnerable and fighting to protect the miracle of life,”  said Grassley. 

“This legislation would require health care practitioners to provide the same care for a child born alive following an abortion attempt, as they would to any infant born at the same gestational age. We have a responsibility to protect those who are most vulnerable and ensure they are cared for with dignity and respect,”  said Hoeven.  “Each life is a blessing, and I will continue fighting to protect the sanctity of life.” 

“Life is a precious gift from God. This bill makes sure that children who survive abortions receive the medical care they deserve as human beings. I am proud to support it and will continue to work with my colleagues to save as many unborn lives as possible,”  said Budd. 

In this post-Roe, pro-life environment, we need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to protect the sanctity of life. The Born Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act takes critical steps to protect and preserve some of our country’s most vulnerable,”  said Tim Scott.  “Creating a culture of life is what is needed as we move forward! I am grateful to Senator Lankford for his leadership and his efforts to steward that culture!” 

“As parents to four young kids, my wife and I are proudly pro-life and believe we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable in our society,”  said Sheehy.  “Caring for and protecting innocent babies who are born alive after a botched abortion should not be a partisan issue – it’s common sense and common humanity. I’m proud to join my colleagues in doing the right thing and standing for life.” 

“I will always fight to protect the sanctity of life. The barbaric practice of murdering babies after they are born has no place in America. This is not about Republican or Democrat; this is about right and wrong. I’m glad to partner with my Republican colleagues to end the practice of terminating the lives of babies who are born alive and stand up for the most vulnerable among us,”  said Tuberville. 

“When an infant clings to life after an abortion procedure, doctors have a duty to care for that child. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act would protect these defenseless boys and girls. There’s no reason Congress should delay in sending it to the president’s desk,”  said Kennedy. 

“Our Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Actwill give babies who miraculously survive attempted abortions the chance to live the life that they deserve,”  said Young.  “I find it disturbing that Democrats have blocked this life-saving bill previously, and encourage my colleagues to pass this commonsense legislation.” 

“The measure of a civilization is how it treats its most vulnerable members. There are few Americans more vulnerable and deserving of protection than a child who is born surviving an abortion attempt. We must recognize the humanity of these precious children and make every effort to save their lives,”  said Lee. 

“It is tragic that we need to pass legislation to affirm and protect the life of babies who survive abortions,”  said Moran  . “Every child who survives an abortion should be provided the same level of care as any other child born alive at the same gestational age.”

WASHINGTON, DC –  Senator James Lankford (R-OK), Republican Conference Vice Chair, hosted a messaging hour on the Senate floor for his Republican colleagues and delivered remarks calling on the Senate to pass the Laken Riley Act. 

Excerpts 

You’ll see for the next hour a whole group of Republicans coming to the floor to be able to talk about one issue—our need for border security and safer communities. This is something not just Republicans in the Senate are talking about. This is something the American people spoke loud and clear about during the last election, when they elected President Trump, a Republican Senate, and a Republican House. 

… 

Some Americans are familiar with Laken Riley’s story, some are not. Laken Riley was a college student in Georgia who was brutally murdered by a Venezuelan who came into the United States illegally, was detained at the border, but then released, traveled around the country wherever he wanted to under a ‘parole system’ that was given to him at the border in 2022. He committed a crime, was arrested for that crime, and then was released. He committed another crime, shoplifting, was arrested for that crime, and then released. The third crime, as far as we know—there might have been many more—but the third crime, as far as we know, was his murder of Laken Riley. He should have never been in the United States. 

… 

The Laken Riley Act is pretty simple. It says if someone is here illegally and they commit a crime in the United States, stealing Americans’ stuff like he did, that he’s deported. I don’t think it’s a radical concept to be able to say, ‘Americans don’t want someone to come into the country illegally and take their stuff.’ Why this is even a challenge to be able to pass this, I have no idea. 

… 

I’m willing to be able to talk to any one of my Democratic or Republican colleagues that have a question about this, but at the base of this is, why would we let someone who was already illegally present in the country, who we already know has committed additional crimes, just continue to walk our streets just to commit more crimes? Why would we not detain those individuals? On Monday, President Trump will be inaugurated. I am looking forward to working with him and seeing even what happens on day one to be able to secure the border. This is something the American people want. They want a border that is secure. They want communities that are secure, and they want just basic common sense things done.

“Oklahomans know how vital rail service is to our economy, but trains should not block an ambulance or prevent us from getting to work or school on time. These new grants will increase safety and access for each affected community,”  said Lankford. 

Lankford played a critical role in securing funding for these grants by sending the US Federal Railroad Administrator Amit Bose letters of support outlining the need for each project. 

The grants awarded to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the City of Claremore will provide $25.4 million for the Occupied Crossing Mitigation Project in Davis, OK, $1.2 million for the Mannford Railroad Crossing Planning Project to Improve Basin Road Connection, $400,000 for the Prioritizing Crossings to Save Lives in Central Oklahoma Project, and $424,000 for the Claremore Rail Corridor Revitalization: Enhancing Mobility and Safety for a Connected Community Project.

11:06:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC –  Senator James Lankford (R-OK), founding member of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Caucus, introduced a package of bills to make the government more efficient. 

“The American people gave Washington a mandate in November—waste less, save more. Today I’m introducing a first set of bills to follow through on their mandate by prioritizing streamlined regulations, rulemaking, and record keeping. It’s time to put government waste in the doghouse and let DOGE get to work,”  said Lankford. 

This package of bills includes: 

  * The Guidance Clarity Act  to mandate that all federal agencies include a statement clarifying that their guidance documents do not have legal force but are meant to clarify existing laws or policies. 
  * The STEP Act  to enhance the transparency and efficiency of federal payments by requiring detailed reporting on improper payments and implementing stronger financial controls to reduce fraud. 
  * The Telework Reform Act  to update federal telework policies by setting new requirements for telework agreements and introducing measures for monitoring, training, and noncompetitive appointments for remote work positions. 
  * The Early Participation in Regulations Act  to mandate that federal agencies provide an advance notice of proposed rule making for “major rules,” which have significant economic or regulatory impact to encourage early public input. 
  * The SMART Act  to require federal agencies to establish frameworks for retrospective reviews of major rules, assessing their effectiveness, costs, and benefits, with specific timelines and methodologies. 
  * The ACCESS Act  to prohibit federal solicitations from mandating minimum education requirements for contractor personnel unless justified, promoting flexibility in contractor hiring based on skills and experience. 
  * The Improving Federal Financial Management Act  to enhance the roles of Chief Financial Officers in federal agencies, mandate a comprehensive governmentwide four-year financial management plan, and strengthen financial reporting and internal control assessments. 
  * The TRUE Accountability Act  to require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance for federal agencies to develop adaptable internal control plans for managing emergency funding, focusing on preventing improper payments and fraud. 



Lankford’s  latest edition  of his government waste book:  Federal Fumbles: Ways the Federal Government Dropped the Ball  , highlights almost half-a-trillion dollars in government waste. Lankford also championed the  Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act  , which resulted in the launch of the  Federal Program Inventory (FPI)  last year so the American people can see how their tax dollars are spent.

11:06:11 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  — U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), member of the Senate Finance Committee, questioned Scott Bessent, President-elect Trump’s nominee to serve as U.S. Treasury Secretary, at his confirmation hearing. Senator Scott and Mr. Bessent discussed a range of topics, including the stability of our nation’s banking industry, Opportunity Zones, and the 2017  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  (TCJA). 

Excerpts from Senator Scott’s questioning can be found below: 

Watch the full video here.   
  
On the American banking system…    
“One of the things I think about as the right thing… is having some stability in our financial system. One of the places where we need the greatest amount of stability is for our banks. So, think about Silicon Valley Bank and other banks that failed recently. As you can imagine, as the chairman of the Banking Committee, I care deeply about the stability and strength of our banking system. From your vantage point, can you provide your assessment of the current safety and soundness of the U.S. banking industry, and what steps do you believe are necessary to ensure long term stability?” 

On Opportunity Zones …    
“As you know, I wrote the legislation and Opportunity Zones was in fact a bipartisan piece of legislation – although it’s only supported by Republicans. And the results of the Opportunity Zones have been astounding. My friends who are mayors, Democrat mayors, support it and celebrate it. And my friends who are Republican governors support it and celebrate it because the fact is simple that $84 billion [that has been] committed and invested in Opportunity Zones have led to real help coming into some distressed communities. It’s only had less than a five percent gentrification rate, which is really important… So many folks, mayors around the country, said for the first time, because of Opportunity Zones, they’re seeing affordable housing in their downtown areas… I hope that the administration will spend some time encouraging and supporting the next iteration of Opportunity Zones.” 

On the TCJA…    
“As a result of the TCJA, we saw the richest Americans’ tax burden, as a percent of revenues coming in, go up and we saw the poorest Americans’ [tax burden], as a percent of revenue coming into the government, go down. I think the easiest way to say that is to recognize that a single mother – like the one who raised me – in 2017 made on average $40,000 a year. Her tax burden… her tax rate went down by 71 percent. That is a result of good policy being good politics, and I hope we keep our eye on the ball of helping the average American have more of their money in their pockets.”

11:06:12 root         DEBUG    Desc: In his first hearing as Chairman, Senator Scott welcomed new members to the committee and stated he looked forward to working with Ranking Member Warren. 

WASHINGTON  — At today’s hearing on Scott Turner’s nomination to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, stressed the importance of expanding access to quality, affordable housing to help more Americans achieve their version of the American Dream. 

In his opening remarks, Senator Scott highlighted Mr. Turner’s record and leadership directing investments in Opportunity Zones, Senator Scott’s initiative under the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  to increase development in economically distressed communities. 

Senator Scott noted he looks forward to working with Mr. Turner to cut bureaucratic red tape, advance commonsense housing solutions, and put more Americans on the path to homeownership. 

Senator Scott’s  opening remarks  as delivered: 

First, I’d like to take the time to say I’m very grateful to my Republican colleagues for allowing me to serve as the chairman for this 119th Congress. 

I’d like to welcome our new members to the United States Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Let me suggest that this is not simply the Banking Committee. Without any question, urban affairs and housing are critical to meeting the needs and the objectives of the American people. Our new members include Senator Pete Ricketts, Senator Jim Banks, Senator Bernie Moreno, Senator Dave McCormick, Senator Andy Kim, Senator Gallego, Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester, and Senator Angela Alsobrooks. 

I look forward to working with our Ranking Member, Elizabeth Warren, on addressing some of the issues that our nation will face. Without any question, my hope is that in many ways, we’ll have an opportunity to have a bipartisan conversation, looking for bipartisan solutions to many of the issues. That will probably not likely be the case all the time, but it can’t be the case some of the time. 

And when it is, we should look for ways to achieve that objective for the American people. 

…    
  
The American people seen their economic fortunes turned to dust. The devastation of the Biden administration’s policies led to mortgage rates going from 2.65 percent in January 2021 to 7.79 percent by October 2023, crushing dreams of millions of Americans wanting to be homeowners. Draining savings of so many people. Devastating hope around the greatest country on the planet. 

Reckless spending was literally stealing the spending power of so many Americans. I remember these similar days when I was growing up as a poor kid in a single parent household. Homeownership was just so far away for me and my mom – it just wasn’t an option. Housing isn’t just about shelter – housing is about opportunity, and it is about stability. Housing creates the foundation for achieving the American Dream. 

It’s about creating strong communities where families can thrive and build a better, brighter future. Under the Biden administration and progressive leadership, HUD spending at the same time soared to record levels. And yet the latest homelessness survey found an 18 percent increase in just the last 12 months, 33 percent increase since 2020. Since President Biden took office, mortgage rates have ballooned by 150 percent and rents by 20 percent. 

Despite all the subsidies and all the trillions of dollars they spent, not much good has happened. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, if you look at the big picture – African American homeownership and the levels have not changed substantially since 1968, when the Fair Housing Act was passed. The data is clear – the American Dream of homeownership is slipping further and further away. 

But today, it is a new day in America, and new leadership brings hope and opportunity and enthusiasm back to the American people. Scott Turner is a native Texan who has had an exceptional journey from professional athlete to public servant. He understands firsthand the importance of hard work and what it means, as he was a dishwasher when he was in high school. 

He also understands the challenge that families face because of drug addiction within the family. He worked his butt off and had a very successful NFL career. He played cornerback for nine seasons. He played for the Denver Broncos, the San Diego Charge…and the Washington Redskins. 

You know, for a guy who now spends too much time in Washington, D.C., I always thought D.C. met Dallas Cowboys. I apologize, I apologize. I know that’s going because a lot of bad e-mails coming my way. But, Mr. Turner, I will not hold that against you that you play for the Redskins. 

I know you’re here to serve the American people, and sometimes two different sides have to come together to make something positive and powerful happen for other people. One thing I have found to be completely clear about who you are, and I met you many years ago. You never give up – I don’t think giving up is in your vocabulary. And we need a visionary leader just like that at HUD. 

After hanging up your cleats, Mr. Turner, you spent two terms in the state legislature in Texas. You recently were the executive director, as Senator Cornyn said, of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council under President Trump. In this role, you helped the Opportunity Zones that I wrote become a very successful program, with over $50 billion in private investment going into Opportunity Zones – devastated communities, typically majority minority – seeing revitalization and rehabilitation become a reality without gentrifying those communities. 

As a former chairman of the county council in Charleston, South Carolina, I can tell you that the vast majority, the vast majority of housing issues must be solved at the local level. But there are things that we can do here in Congress to address the affordability crisis. And that role is getting government out of the way as often as possible. 

This is why I introduced my  ROAD to Housing Act  in Congress. And I am so thankful for so many supporters in this room of that bill. I’ve seen firsthand the negative impact of renting your house only to give it back, and that is, in a few short words, the 2008 crisis. Let’s not relive the mistakes of the past, but instead forge a new path for everyday Americans. 

This commonsense bill takes a comprehensive view of federal housing policy and recenters support around families, helping those who are homeless, those who are renting, and those who will be homeowners. I look forward to marking up this bill in the weeks ahead and working with my colleagues on a bipartisan framework so that we can make sure that all segments of the housing market get the necessary attention to move forward. 

As we start this new chapter, we need new leadership. Scott Turner is the solution we are looking for and I look forward to his leadership at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

11:06:30 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner Urges Federal Agencies to Disclose and Secure their AI Use
11:06:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:06:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the leaders of federal departments and agencies to promote data collection and transparency around their adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). In a series of letters to 23 department and agency heads, he emphasized the critical importance of collecting data on AI’s impacts promoting productivity and improving government outcomes, and he posed a series of questions about how agencies are making decisions that weigh the benefits and risks of the technology alongside the experiences of federal employees. 

AI is having a profound impact on the workforce across both public and private sectors, often allowing workers to complete tasks more efficiently and cost-effectively. In Fiscal Year 2022, 20 of 23 federal agencies reported almost 1,200 current and planned AI use cases. However, agencies haven’t been forthcoming with data on how AI has changed outcomes for federal agencies, or how data is being used to inform future decision-making. 

The letter highlights several of these potential and actual use cases, saying,  “Per the AI case use inventory, the utilization of artificial intelligence across federal departments and agencies has allowed the federal workforce and contractors to work efficiently and creatively – improving government operations and delivering better results for the American people. These examples include the Social Security Administration using AI to expedite determinations for disability benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs utilizing AI to capture trends and facilitate processing of veteran feedback, and the Department of Justice applying AI to accurately identify and process threat tips.” 

In the letter, Sen. Warner stressed the urgent need for departments and agencies to release data on their AI adoption, so they can implement best practices and work to deliver better results for the American people. It also asks how feedback from federal employees and contractors is being considered to make decisions that best support both workers and outcomes. 

“While government-sourced, publicly-available information provides sector or task-specific summaries of how the aforementioned federal departments and agencies are adopting artificial intelligence, I am concerned about the limitations of this information with respect to the broader adoption at scale of AI in the federal government, including the need for measurable data and conclusive assessments on how individual AI use cases are enhancing the missions of federal departments and agencies,”  Sen. Warner continued.  Establishing data collection standards that track the progress of AI’s adoption in the federal government will help better understand the state of integration, assess its effectiveness, implications, and appropriate usages, and guide the direction of future adoption plans.” 

Sens. Warner sent the letter to the following federal departments and agencies: The Departments of: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, State, Interior, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency, the General Services Administration, NASA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Science Foundation, the Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 

Sen. Warner, a former tech entrepreneur and Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been a longtime leader on AI-related issues, particularly within the federal government. He led  bipartisan legislation  to help the federal government mitigate risks associated with AI while still being able to benefit from this emerging technology. In May 2024, he introduced  bipartisan legislation  to improve the tracking and processing of security and safety incidents and risks associated with AI, including through improving information sharing between the federal government and private companies. He also has  repeatedly pushed on companies  to keep their promises to promote security and safety throughout the rollout of novel AI technologies. 

A copy of the letter is available  here  and below: 

I write to you today regarding your agency’s utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and enabled technologies and request information on your department or agency’s use of those systems and technologies. I request sufficient information to understand the purposes to which your department or agency uses those systems, the analyses of the possible and actual uses of AI applications by your department or agency, and the metrics by which your department or agency evaluates the use of those systems, including by federal workers and contractors. 

In a world where we are still working to understand the full capabilities and impact of advancements in artificial intelligence, it is critical that the federal government lead in data collection and evidence-based decision-making in the adoption of these technologies. In that same vein, the adoption of AI tools by the federal government should be based on measurable outcomes, such as productivity gains. 

The use of artificial intelligence across various occupations and industries is transforming the labor market and impacting the global economy broadly. More specifically, the application of AI in the workforce has yielded promising results, including the potential for increased worker productivity. In many instances, artificial intelligence has allowed for tasks to be completed faster and more efficiently, allowing workers to focus on high-value responsibilities and expanding their range of work. 

The private sector, particularly innovative artificial intelligence companies and the businesses that use their products, are leading the charge in measuring and providing real-time dynamic data on the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on their workforce and worker productivity. This data includes, but is not limited to, specific measurements on how AI has led to time-saved on specific tasks, production volume, improving error rates, and customer satisfaction. These metrics and subsequent analyses are useful in evaluating the impact and value of artificial intelligence. 

As of the 118  th  Congress, the federal government employs over 2 million individuals, with the Commonwealth of Virginia holding the third-largest constituency of federal civilian employees. For FY2024, the federal government executed over 104 million contracts, similarly employing, directly and indirectly, individuals to carry out the missions of federal departments and agencies. These public servants perform essential work for our country, and as detailed below, some of their work is complemented by and supplemented through the integration of artificial intelligence systems and technologies. 

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) demonstrated that in FY2022, twenty of 23 agencies reported about 1,200 current and planned artificial intelligence use cases. Per the AI case use inventory, the utilization of artificial intelligence across federal departments and agencies has allowed the federal workforce and contractors to work efficiently and creatively – improving government operations and delivering better results for the American people. These examples include the Social Security Administration using AI to expedite determinations for disability benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs utilizing AI to capture trends and facilitate processing of veteran feedback, and the Department of Justice applying AI to accurately identify and process threat tips. The use case inventory applies the definition of artificial intelligence as provided in Section 238(g) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. 

While government-sourced, publicly-available information provides sector or task-specific summaries of how the aforementioned federal departments and agencies are adopting artificial intelligence, I am concerned about the limitations of this information with respect to the broader adoption at scale of AI in the federal government, including the need for measurable data and conclusive assessments on how individual AI use cases are enhancing the missions of federal departments and agencies. Establishing data collection standards that track the progress of AI’s adoption in the federal government will help better understand the state of integration, assess its effectiveness, implications, and appropriate usages, and guide the direction of future adoption plans. 

As such, I respectfully request that you respond to this letter with detailed answers to the following questions by January 17, 2025: 

  * Does your department or agency utilize AI? 
    * If yes, please provide a high-level summary of the utilization of AI, including uses by administrative or operational units of your department or agency. 
    * If no, please detail how your department or agency reached the decision to not utilize AI. 
  * How does your department or agency identify uses cases, needs, or other instances in which it deems the use of AI to be appropriate?

11:06:31 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner on Proposed Special Registration Rule for Telehealth Prescribing
11:06:31 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:06:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, today released the statement below on a  new proposed rule  by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) governing the use of telemedicine to prescribe controlled substances. This proposal follows years of advocacy by Sen. Warner, who has been outspoken about the need to utilize telehealth to help address the dramatic shortage of mental health providers nationwide. In August, Sen. Warner once again called for the establishment of a special registration rule for providers, and  blasted  a reported proposal that would have significantly affected patients’ ability to access certain prescriptions through telemedicine. 

“Since 2008, Congress has pushed the DEA to create a special registration that allows specially certified and trained prescribers to safely prescribe controlled substances  via telehealth without requiring an in-person visit  . Today, I applaud the DEA for listening to lawmakers and taking a huge step forward towards providing permanent certainty for the many patients who rely on telehealth prescribing and have done so for years, thanks to pandemic-era flexibilities. While the proposed tiered approach is generally commensurate with the increased risk of diversion and fraud, I am concerned that some of the proposed guardrails are overly restrictive and do not reflect the legitimate ways telemedicine is safely conducted today. I look forward to working with stakeholders, the DEA, and my colleagues in Congress to review this proposal and ensure that any final rule meets the needs of patients while aligning with commonsense 21  st  century health care practices,”  said. Sen. Warner. 

During COVID-19, patients widely adopted telehealth as a convenient and accessible way to get health care services remotely, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. This was made possible by the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, which allowed for a number of flexibilities, including utilizing an exception to the in-person medical evaluation requirement under the  Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act,  legislation regulating the online prescription of controlled substances. Now that the Public Health Emergency has expired and temporary DEA flexibilities are set to expire at the end of 2025, patients will soon lose the ability to reap the benefits of a mature telehealth system whose responsible providers know how to take care of their patients remotely when appropriate. 

Since 2008, Congress has directed the DEA to set up a special registration process, another exception process under the  Ryan Haight Act  , that would permanently allow for quality health care providers to evaluate a patient and prescribe these medications over telehealth safely, as they’ve done during the pandemic. The new rule proposed by the DEA would allow medical providers to register to prescribe controlled substances through telehealth. 

Sen. Warner, a former tech entrepreneur, has been a longtime advocate for increased access to telehealth. He is an original cosponsor of the  CONNECT for Health Act  , which would expand coverage of telehealth services through Medicare, make COVID-19 telehealth flexibilities permanent, improve health outcomes, and make it easier for patients to safely connect with their doctors. He previously wrote to both the  Biden  and  Trump  administrations to urge the DEA to finalize regulations that allow doctors to prescribe controlled substances through telehealth. Sen. Warner also sent a  letter  to Senate leadership during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, calling for the permanent expansion of access to telehealth services. In September 2023, Sen. Warner led bipartisan partners to  share serious concerns  about an earlier version of DEA’s proposed rule, which would also have seriously curtailed access to prescriptions through telemedicine. 

In 2018, Sen. Warner included a provision to expand financial coverage for virtual substance use treatment in the  Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018  . In 2003, then-Gov. Warner expanded Medicaid coverage for telemedicine statewide, including evaluation and management visits, a range of individual psychotherapies, the full range of consultations, and some clinical services, including in cardiology and obstetrics. Coverage was also expanded to include non-physician providers. Among other benefits, the telehealth expansion allowed individuals in medically underserved and remote areas of Virginia to access quality specialty care that isn’t always available at home.

11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner & Kaine Announce Nearly $20 Million in Federal Funding to Promote Climate Resilience and Lower Energy Costs in Southwest Virginia
11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, – Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $19,886,658  in federal funding for the University of Virginia’s College at Wise in conjunction with the University of Virginia and key partners in the region to enhance resilient infrastructure and help lower energy costs for communities in Southwest Virginia. This funding was awarded through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program, which was created by the  Inflation Reduction Act  that both senators cast a deciding vote for. 

“Resiliency and energy efficiency are crucial ways to make our communities more safe while also lowering costs,”  the senators said  . “We’re glad this funding, which was made possible by the  Inflation Reduction Act  , will help advance those goals in Southwest Virginia and address important community needs.” 

This funding will implement Climate Resilience Planning in 10 communities throughout Southwest Virginia and fund resilient affordable housing, electric vehicle charging stations, energy-efficient and carbon-neutral child care and workforce training, and resilient gathering spaces that double as community capacity building spaces and health care access points. The projects receiving this funding are expected to mitigate over 40,000 metric tons of CO2 in the next 25 years and save child care centers over $50,000 in energy costs, allowing more funding to be directed toward child care worker salaries. 

$13,305,591 of the $19,886,658 announced today will be allocated as follows: 

  * $4,594,245  for  United Way  of Southwest Virginia  to improve energy efficiency at care centers, including through solar installation and upgrades to child care facilities, outdoor classrooms, and other initiatives. 
  * $1,757,708  for  Dickenson County  to build a resilience hub in the Town of Haysi outside of the floodplain. This project includes engineering and architectural design and permits, construction of the facility, and the installation of an EV fast charger. 
  * $4,847,841  for  Buchanan County  to build housing in Southern Gap outside of the floodplain. This project includes construction of water, sewer, power and telecommunications infrastructure; interior roadways and walkways; two single family dwelling units; multi-family town house rental units; and an EV charging station at the Regional Office Park Office Building. 
  * $132,000  for  Virginia Tech  for a community engagement project on resilience strategic planning. This community-based resilience planning process involves the University of Virginia’s  Resilience Adaptation Feasibility Tool (RAFT)  , which helps climate planners and localities pinpoint and evaluate environmental risks, including drought, flooding, and extreme weather, in different communities. 
  * $1,973,797  for  James Madison University  to advance energy career development. 



Sens. Warner and Kaine have long supported efforts to expand and promote energy infrastructure throughout the Commonwealth. Earlier this week, Warner and Kaine  announced over $10 million  in federal funding for electric vehicle charging ports in Virginia.

11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner, Kaine, Bennet, Hickenlooper, King, Lujan, Merkley, Shaheen, Van Hollen & Welch Unveil Amendment to Improve Laken Riley Act
11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:06:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Angus I. King (I-ME), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Peter Welch (D-VT) unveiled an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  to improve the ability of the legislation to protect our communities. 

This amendment would ensure that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers can use their limited time and detention facilities to detain truly dangerous individuals who pose an immediate risk to the public. The senators’ amendment would help improve the  Laken Riley Act  by ensuring that only those undocumented individuals who are found guilty of a crime—or have been charged with, or arrested for, a crime and failed to appear for court appointments—will be detained under this bill. 

“Laken Riley should be here today, and my heart goes out to her family and loved ones. It’s clear that we need to take steps to reform our broken immigration system — and that includes enforcement,”  said Sen. Warner.  “I’m proud to introduce this amendment to help strengthen public safety and improve the Laken Riley Act to make sure we dedicate our resources to getting dangerous individuals off our streets.” 

“My thoughts are with Laken Riley’s family in the wake of her horrific murder. Americans have a right to be safe in their communities and—for many reasons—deserve commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system,”  said Sen. Kaine  . “But in its current form, I have serious concerns that the  Laken Riley Act  —which did not receive a single hearing or vote from its committee of jurisdiction in the Senate—will burden our law enforcement officers in a way that will make it impossible to get truly dangerous individuals off the street and ultimately make Virginians less safe. I’m glad to have worked with my colleagues on this amendment to try to fix that, and urge Senate leadership to put it up for a vote.” 

“The murder of Laken Riley was horrific, and my prayers are with her family and loved ones. I have always been supportive of immigration policies that are tough, fair, and keep Americans safe. It's why I voted for the bipartisan border security agreement last year,”  said Sen. Luján  . “But this legislation as it stands would divert resources from serious threats, risk abuse by the incoming administration, endanger DACA holders, and cost American taxpayers billions. That’s why I’m joining my colleagues to introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill, and I urge Senate leadership to consider it for a vote.” 

“Mandatory lockup of adults who are convicted of a crime and pose a threat to the community or a flight risk makes a lot of sense. But mandatory lockups of children accused of minor offenses? Permanent imprisonment of kids accused of stealing lollipops? This is twisted. And super damaging to the children. The Kaine amendment strikes the right balance for community safety,”  said Sen. Merkley. 

“Laken Riley’s tragic murder should never have occurred, and while our thoughts continue to be with her loved ones, the Laken Riley Act is a bipartisan attempt to help prevent future tragedies. For too long, Congress has failed to address our broken immigration system and border security. I was deeply disappointed when last year’s bipartisan border security agreement failed because it would have increased protections at the border and stemmed the flow of fentanyl into the United States. That’s why I voted to proceed with consideration of the Laken Riley Act and why I’m proud to help introduce this amendment to strengthen the bill. Our amendment would improve our enforcement mechanisms to better ensure we can keep offenders off the streets and strengthen public safety,”  said Sen. Shaheen  . 

“We must keep our communities safe and prioritize the detention of violent offenders. I support Senator Kaine’s amendment because it directly addresses the circumstances that led to the terrible murder of Laken Riley, without creating a system that diverts resources away from the detention of violent offenders. If Republicans are serious about working with us to improve public safety, they will help ensure this amendment – which would improve the bill significantly – is considered and passed,”  said Sen. Van Hollen. 

“Laken Riley’s murder was heartbreaking, and my thoughts go out to her family and loved ones. Democrats believe we need serious reform on immigration, and that includes enforcement. But this bill has significant problems, and that’s why we’re partnering together to bring commonsense, pragmatic changes through the amendment process. This bill, in its current form, includes no requirement that a person be convicted of a property offense before they are held indefinitely, which diminishes due process. It grants unprecedented power to state attorneys general to control our immigration system and threatens to overwhelm our federal courts. And it also puts children in danger of mandatory detention,”  said Sen. Welch.  “I believe our amendment to fix the issues outlined is fair and strengthens the  Laken Riley Act  . It should earn quick bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues in Senate Leadership to bring it up for a vote on the Senate floor.”

“This ceasefire announcement will reunite families with their loved ones by securing the release of innocent Israelis, Americans, and other individuals who were abducted by Hamas in their brutal October 7 terror attacks and have continued to be held for more than 460 days. It will also bring sorely needed respite to civilians in Gaza who have been suffering for too long in the face of extreme hunger, death, and widespread destruction. I applaud the President and his administration, who worked tirelessly to reach this agreement, and officials from Qatar and Egypt for bringing this to fruition. Like so many people around the world, I am both heartened to see an end in sight for a painful war that has torn apart families and leveled entire communities, and solemn in remembrance of the lives taken on October 7 and all those who have been killed since. I remain committed to working with the incoming administration to ensure that the terms of this agreement are met on both sides and that humanitarian assistance can make its way to the Palestinian people as outlined in the deal.”

11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner & Kaine Announce $3.9 Million in Federal Funding to Grow Richmond Petersburg Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Hub Workforce
11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $3.9 million  in federal funding from the  American Rescue Plan  for the Community College Workforce Alliance in  Disputanta  to expand regional workforce training programs to support the Richmond-Petersburg Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (APM) cluster and help Virginians get the skills they need for jobs in the advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotechnology industries. The APM cluster, which is led by the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority, manufactures critical drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The funding was allocated through the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s (EDA)  Good Jobs Challenge  . 

“The Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster has seen tremendous growth in recent years, and I am thrilled by the innovation that has taken place,”  said Warner.  “This funding, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan, for the Community College Workforce Alliance will continue to build on these efforts, ensuring that we have a capable, ready workforce to step into the good-paying, skilled jobs created in the Petersburg region.” 

“As a city councilman, mayor, governor, and senator, I’ve been proud of what we’ve done to grow the Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster and onshore the manufacturing of essential medicines and their ingredients. I’m thrilled the Community College Workforce Alliance in Disputanta is receiving federal funding from the American Rescue Plan we passed to help further the cluster’s innovative efforts and ensure we have the workforce needed to fill these critical roles,”  said Kaine.  “I will continue working to support the APM cluster and help Virginians access good-paying manufacturing jobs in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotechnology.” 

Warner and Kaine have long supported the APM cluster in Richmond/Petersburg and have supported policies to strengthen domestic manufacturing of critical medicines. In 2023, the APM cluster was designated as a Tech Hub under the  CHIPS and Science Act  for its innovative work in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing. The senators also worked to secure  $52.9 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan  for the cluster. In August 2024, Kaine  toured  Phlow Corp., a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in the Virginia APM cluster, which produces critical medicines and boosts the national supply chain. In April 2022, Kaine  visited  the cluster to learn more about its efforts to streamline prescription drug manufacturing. Kaine helped form and grow the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority while he was on Richmond City Council, served on the Authority’s board as Mayor of Richmond, and appointed its board members as Governor of Virginia.

11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner & Kaine Urge Biden Administration to Extend TPS for all Eligible Countries
11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:06:45 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) have urged the Biden administration to immediately re-designate or extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to the maximum extent allowable under the law for all eligible countries. The senators commended President Biden’s  recent action  to extend status for El Salvador, Venezuela, Sudan, and Ukraine, while stressing the need to extend these benefits to all remaining eligible TPS countries as the current administration winds down. 

TPS provides protection to foreign nationals in the United States whose home countries are experiencing temporary and extraordinary conditions, including armed conflict, natural disasters, and other extraordinary conditions that render return unsafe. Currently, 17 countries have TPS designations, and as of September 30, 2024 nearly 1.1 million foreign nationals were protected by TPS, living in all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. 

In the Commonwealth, 28,225 people are living under TPS: 545 individuals from Afghanistan, 95 from Burma, 95 from Cameroon, 15,485 from El Salvador, 445 from Ethiopia, 1,340 from Haiti, 2,720 from Honduras, 325 from Nepal, 60 from Nicaragua, 20 from Somalia, 25 from South Sudan, 165 from Sudan, 170 from Syria, 895 from Ukraine, 5,700 from Venezuela, and 135 individuals from Yemen. 

Highlighting the importance of the TPS program in communities across the country, the senators wrote,  “Many of these individuals with TPS have lived in the U.S. for decades, calling this country their home. They are contributing members of our society, including our colleagues and neighbors. The TPS program provides them a way to support themselves, contribute to the U.S. workforce and economy, and keep their families together.” 

With President-elect Trump taking office in one week, the fate of this program is uncertain. Both he and Vice President-elect Vance have  signaled  that significant immigration policy changes could include eliminating the TPS program all together. As a result, Sens. Warner and Kaine are stressing the urgency of this request. 

“Unfortunately, TPS beneficiaries are at risk of losing their legal status and could face removal proceedings to countries that have been deemed unsafe to return to and where their lives would be at grave risk,”  they continued.  “The incoming administration has vowed to terminate the TPS program, just as they attempted to during their first term. Within the first six months of this incoming term, six TPS designations, covering over 76,000 beneficiaries, are set to expire.” 

Sens. Warner and Kaine have long-championed TPS for vulnerable migrants from countries including Haiti, Ukraine, Cameroon,  Sudan  , El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Last year, the senators  urged the Biden administration to extend TPS  for Haitians amid spiking violence. In December 2023, the senators  praised  a decision by the Department of Homeland Security to grant existing TPS recipients additional time to re-register for the program. 

A copy of the letter is available  here  and text is below: 

Dear President Biden, 

We thank you for your commitment to expanding Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and commend your most recent announcements to extend TPS for foreign nationals from El Salvador, Venezuela, Sudan, and Ukraine. We write to urgently request that your administration build on your recent TPS actions and issue a re-designation or extension of status, to the maximum extent possible under the law, for all TPS-eligible countries. 

Through the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has the discretion to issue a Temporary Protected Status designation and provide for temporary relief from removal and work authorization to certain foreign nationals from countries under specific circumstances, including armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return. 

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1,095,115 foreign nationals residing in all 50 states, including D.C. and U.S. territories, were protected by TPS. This includes nearly 30,000 TPS recipients in Virginia. 

Many of these individuals with TPS have lived in the U.S. for decades, calling this country their home. They are contributing members of our society, including our colleagues and neighbors. The TPS program provides them a way to support themselves, contribute to the U.S. workforce and economy, and keep their families together. 

Unfortunately, TPS beneficiaries are at risk of losing their legal status and could face removal proceedings to countries that have been deemed unsafe to return to and where their lives would be at grave risk. The incoming administration has vowed to terminate the TPS program, just as they attempted to during their first term. Within the first six months of this incoming term, six TPS designations, covering over 76,000 beneficiaries, are set to expire. 

As such, we strongly urge your administration to re-designate or extend TPS for countries with existing designations. These actions will provide much needed clarity for current TPS holders and prevent harmful deportations to countries designated as unsafe. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, 

###

11:06:50 root         DEBUG    Titles: Warner & Kaine Announce over $12 Million in Federal Funding for Leesburg, Norfolk, Abingdon, and Shenandoah Valley Airports
11:06:50 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:06:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine announced  $12,352,167  in federal funding for improvements for airports throughout the Commonwealth. This funding was awarded through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA)  Airport Infrastructure Grants  (AIG) program, which was created by the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  that both senators helped pass. 

“Virginia’s airports are crucial for advancing our economy and connecting us to the rest of the country and the world,”  the senators said  . “We’re glad this funding, which was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help make needed upgrades and expansions possible for airports throughout the Commonwealth. We will continue working to bolster Virginia’s infrastructure and economic growth.” 

The funding is broken down as follows: 

  * $  341,477  for the  Town of Leesburg to  construct a new 20,000-square-yard apron at the north end of the airfield to increase aircraft parking capacity at the Leesburg Executive Airport. 
  * $  430,000  for the  Town of Leesburg  to  construct a new sponsor-owned federal contract tower and acquire and install eligible equipment. Warner and Kaine, alongside then-Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton (D-VA-10), strongly backed Leesburg in its negotiations with the FAA over costs to operate a remote tower until this new brick-and-mortar tower is completed. 
  * $9,662,240  for the  Norfolk Airport Authority  to  acquire and install three new passenger boarding bridges to accommodate more aircraft operations, expand Terminal Concourse A by 25,000 square feet and three gates, reconstruct 50,000 square feet of existing Terminal Concourse A, create new restrooms, and other upgrades. 
  * $  1,055,800  for the  Virginia Highlands Airport Commission  to  construct a new 12,915 square foot and a new 3,600 square foot sponsor-owned hangar for aircraft storage, which will boost revenue and improve the airport’s financial self-sufficiency. 
  * $  862,650  for the  Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport Commission  to construct a new 12,500 square yard apron to accommodate more aircraft operations, construct two new 12,000 square foot sponsor-owned hangars for aircraft, which will boost revenue and improve the airport’s financial self-sufficiency, and expand an existing commercial apron by an additional 1,800 square yards to accommodate more passengers and more aircraft operations. 



Sens. Warner and Kaine have long supported efforts to improve Virginia’s airports. Sens. Warner and Kaine have secured  millions in federal funding  for airports across Virginia through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  . In October 2024, they  announced nearly $57 million  in federal funding to revitalize Virginia airports. In September 2024, they  announced more than $46 million  in federal funding for improvements to Virginia airports through the Airport Improvement Program. The senators have previously  announced $104.6 million  in combined federal funding for the new terminal building at Dulles.

11:06:53 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-13
11:06:53 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced  $10,797,461  in federal funding for the  Virginia Department of Energy  to build 392 electric vehicle (EV) charging ports  at urban and rural tourism destinations across Virginia. Over half of the 392 chargers will be installed in disadvantaged communities across the Commonwealth to increase EV accessibility for all Virginians. The grant is allocated through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, which was made possible by the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  , which both senators helped pass. 

“Electric vehicles will help create healthier communities for future generations by reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. However, it’s critical that Virginians who choose to purchase EVs have access to charging stations so they can get where they need to go,”  said the senators.  “We’re glad the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we helped pass is bringing this funding to Virginia to install EV charging ports across the Commonwealth, especially in areas that receive a high volume of visitors.” 

Sens. Warner and Kaine have long supported Virginia’s clean energy economy. Both senators were key votes in the passage of the  Inflation Reduction Act  , legislation that included tax credits for individuals who purchase electric vehicles and funding to expand access to EV technology. In 2022, Warner and Kaine announced  almost $16 million  in  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  funding was delivered to install EV charging ports.

11:07:14 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:07:14 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), James Lankford (R-Okla.),and Jim Banks (R-Ind.) reintroduced the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  to protect newborns that survive abortions by requiring they receive care from health care practitioners. 

“Our  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  will give babies who miraculously survive attempted abortions the chance to live the life that they deserve,”  said Senator Young.  “I find it disturbing that Democrats have blocked this life-saving bill previously, and encourage my colleagues to pass this commonsense legislation.” 

“No child should be denied medical care simply because they are ‘unwanted.’ Today, if an abortion procedure fails and a child is born alive, doctors can just ignore the crying baby on the table and watch them slowly die of neglect. That’s not an abortion, that’s infanticide,”  said Senator Lankford. 

“I’ve always fought to defend the unborn and will continue to do so in the Senate. It’s unconscionable that we even need such a law, but it’s essential to protect the most vulnerable among us. Now that Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress and the most pro-life President in my lifetime, we have the opportunity to see this important bill signed into law,”  said Senator Banks. 

In 2002, Congress passed  the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act  which codified in law that a newborn, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, is to be legally recognized as a person from the moment of birth if he or she shows any sign of life. The 2002 law did not provide any measures to enforce the protection of these infants, which has allowed the current practice of leaving a child to die after a botched abortion to continue. The  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  would add clear expectations of care, hospital transfer requirements, mandatory reporting, private rights of action for moms, and reasonable criminal penalties for health care professionals who violate the law. 

The legislation was also cosponsored by Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Curtis (R-Utah), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), John Kennedy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.).

“I’m proud to be recognized by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America with an ‘A+’ rating for supporting pro-life policies in the Senate. There is no greater cause than giving a voice to the voiceless, and I will continue to advocate for policies that affirm the right to life and support the unborn,”  said Senator Young. 

According to the scorecard, “Sen. Young has voted consistently to defend the lives of the unborn and infants. This includes stopping hard-earned tax dollars from paying for abortion, including abortion travel expenses, whether domestically or internationally, and pushing back on the [Biden] administration’s extreme abortion executive actions.”

11:07:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan group of senators in calling on the Biden Administration to cease secret negotiations with foreign trading partners. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is attempting to change at least three major trade agreements in secret, while sacrificing valuable leverage that USTR could use to win concessions from trading partners that would benefit Americans. 

USTR is seeking changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) by the end of the presidential term. 

“Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation,”  the senators wrote.  “USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies.” 

The senators warned that making concessions to trading partners would sacrifice leverage to make progress on a number of U.S. priorities. In USMCA negotiations, for example, USTR should use any available leverage to address Mexico’s illegal fishing practices and energy laws that favor Mexican fossil fuels over American energy, as well as Canada’s unfair dairy policies and taxes on digital services. USTR should also push to resolve the United States’ many outstanding concerns with Colombia, including labor standards and workers’ rights, corn and dairy market access, and auto regulations. 

“Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred,”  the senators continued. 

In addition to Senator Young, Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) also signed the letter. 

Full text of the letter can be found  here  . 

Senator Young has called on USTR to make trade agreements more transparent by working closely with Congress. In November 2023, Young  called  on the White House to engage in comprehensive consultations to ensure that U.S. digital trade policy combats the repressive policies of Russia and China and promotes open markets for digital goods exported by American creators and businesses.

WASHINGTON –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) spoke on the Senate floor and called for passage of the  Laken Riley Act  . The bill, which passed the House of Representatives last week, is currently under consideration in the Senate.   
  
“Weakening border enforcement, incentivizing criminals with specious asylum claims to cross our border, failing to detain and deport these very same people for crimes committed far away from it – these were the policies that led to Laken’s death. This cannot happen again,”  said Senator Young.  “That is why we need to pass the Laken Riley Act.”   
  
The legislation would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest illegal aliens who commit theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting offenses and would mandate that these aliens are detained until they are removed from the United States so they cannot reoffend or commit further crimes. 

“Enforcing immigration law is a national security priority… This bill is one of many steps we should take to reverse the Biden Administration’s open border policies… We should pass it now,”  said Senator Young.  “Let President Biden have his victory tour, but starting next week, the insanity ends, and we begin to secure our border.”

11:07:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senators Todd Young  (R-Ind.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas)  reintroduced the  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  , which would allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any other state that allows concealed carry, while still abiding by that state’s laws. 

“The  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  will protect the constitutional rights of Hoosier gun owners by ensuring any individual who legally owns a gun in Indiana can transport or possess the firearm legally in other states without fear of prosecution,”  said Senator Young. 

More specifically, the  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  would: 

  * Allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any other state with concealed carry laws; 




  * Treat state-issued concealed carry permits like drivers’ licenses where individuals can use their home-state license to drive in another state but must abide by that other state’s speed limit or road laws; and 




  * Protect state sovereignty by not establishing a national standard for concealed carry. 




In addition to Senators Young and Cornyn, U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Thune (R-S.D.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Curtis (R-Utah), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.

11:07:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) recently introduced the  Complete COVID Collections Act  to ensure that billions of stolen taxpayer dollars can continue to be recovered. 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) created COVID relief programs to help small businesses, but unfortunately, many of these programs were taken advantage of by bad actors. The  Complete COVID Collections Act  would extend the authorization of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery – a role that was designed to conduct oversight of pandemic funds – and expand its jurisdiction to cover additional SBA COVID-related programs. It is estimated that more than $200 billion still needs to be recovered. 

“Programs designed to provide relief to our small businesses were repeatedly taken advantage of, leaving small businesses hurting and taxpayers on the hook. I’m glad to join Senator Ernst in this effort to recover taxpayer dollars and protect Americans from fraud and abuse,”  said Senator Young. 

“Con artists took advantage of small businesses’ pain during COVID to defraud government programs designed to help hardworking Americans,”  said Senator Ernst.  “While we are $36 trillion in debt, we especially cannot afford to leave more than $200 billion floating around, especially in the hands of fraudsters. My Republican colleagues and I are making sure that all resources are available in this fight to get taxpayers’ money back and hold these criminals accountable.” 

Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and John Curtis (R-Utah) also sponsored the legislation.

"President Joe Biden is one of the most consequential presidents in American history. With the wisdom and magnificent leadership of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, our nation has been graced by four historic years of progress, hope and unity for hard-working American families. Tonight, President Biden delivered his farewell address to a nation that is stronger because of his leadership. In doing so, he honored the vision of founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations of our children.   
  
"With deep experience and with global relationships that are rivaled by none, President Biden has masterfully led America on the world stage. Under President Biden’s visionary leadership, America has been unequivocal in our commitment to defending Democracy here at home and around the world – and our NATO alliance is stronger and more unified than ever. America was fortunate to have a strong, steady, wise commander-in-chief honoring and promoting American values in the global arena.   
  
"President Biden and Vice President Harris, with the partnership of Democrats in Congress, have built a towering legacy of extraordinary achievement for the American people. They pulled our nation from the depths of the pandemic and ignited the strongest economic recovery in the world with our American Rescue Plan. They seized a once-in-a-century chance to rebuild our nation while investing in our middle class with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. With our CHIPS and Science Act, they declared America’s economic independence: powering a manufacturing boom, driving decades of scientific discovery and creating good-paying jobs across the country. They enacted America's first major gun violence prevention legislation in nearly three decades with our Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and took a monumental step toward fully honoring the service and sacrifice of our heroes in uniform with our PACT Act. With our Inflation Reduction Act, they honored our moral responsibility to save the planet while bringing down costs for working families by lowering prescription drug prices and energy bills. And our Respect for Marriage Act was a triumph of love, liberty and justice for all.   
  
"President Biden and Vice President Harris have earned their place in the pantheon of American democracy. Every American can be proud of the leadership and dignity they brought to the White House – and tonight, we again saw President Biden's great respect for America's remarkable history. With love and gratitude, I salute President Biden and Vice President Harris for always believing in the possibilities of America and building a stronger and fairer future for all of America's families."

“This federal funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – passed by the Democratic Congress in 2021 – is an important investment to increase the accessibility of electric vehicle charging ports across San Francisco,” Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said. “The San Francisco Bay Area leads the nation in electric vehicle use, and this new funding will give families confidence that there will be a place to charge an electric vehicle where we live and work – particularly in disadvantaged communities. By strengthening modern and sustainable electric vehicle infrastructure in San Francisco and across America, we are accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy, reducing pollution in our communities and supporting high-quality jobs.” 

“This historic $15 million federal investment will transform San Francisco’s electric vehicle future,” said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. “With EVs now accounting for over a third of new car sales, we’re at a tipping point in our clean transportation revolution. This funding will bring convenient, affordable charging to neighborhoods citywide, with a focus on communities that have long faced the heaviest burden of vehicle pollution. By installing hundreds of public charging stations, we’re not only supporting the growing number of San Franciscans choosing EVs today but also laying the foundation for our vision of a zero-emission city by 2040.” 

The San Francisco Environment Department will receive $15 million to install up to 300 EV charging ports in publicly accessible garages, lots and curbside locations, primarily serving disadvantaged and other underserved communities. The project deploys both Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers to increase the total number of charging ports in San Francisco by thirty percent. This funding was awarded to San Francisco from the Federal Highway Administration’s Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program in a competitive national selection process.

Watch the full clip  here  . 

Senator Hawley went on to detail some of the many abuses of Biden-Mayorkas DHS, including their retraction of the Remain in Mexico policy, the breakdown of our asylum and parole systems, the creation of a  phony  ‘Disinformation Board,’ an increase in migrant crime, and their failure to disclose pertinent information regarding the  assassination attempts  against President Trump. 

Governor Noem committed to partnering with President Trump to fix these issues, and work to secure our country’s safety for all Americans.

Senator Hawley explained how consulting firms like McKinsey & Company receive multi-million-dollar contracts with the U.S. military while also doing business with some of our most lethal opponents. 

“My view is that if they want to do business with China, I don’t recommend it, but I suppose it’s fine so long as it’s not illegal,”  Senator Hawley said.  “But I don’t think they should simultaneously be getting hundreds of millions, approaching a billion dollars, in federal contracts–military contracts–from our own government.” 

Senator Hawley has a  record  of raising concerns about McKinsey’s conflicts of interests that endanger American security. Last year, he introduced the  Time to Choose Act  , which would restrict firms like McKinsey from receiving government contracts while, at the same time, advising U.S. adversaries like China. Additionally, it would prohibit federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms that hold a contract with certain foreign entities including the CCP.

Senator Hawley also outlined the regulatory authority Vought would have including the ability to enforce the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions.   
  
He questioned Vought as to whether family planning funds under Title X should be used for abortion, whether pregnancy resource centers should be eligible to receive funds through federal grants, and whether he would support the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy which blocks foreign aid from being spent on abortions overseas.   
  
Senator Hawley has long been a champion for the sanctity of life. This week, he introduced the  End Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Providers Act  which would defund Planned Parenthood and abortion providers across the nation.

11:07:28 root         DEBUG    Desc: In today’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  confronted  Adam Isacson, a witness invited by Senate Democrats, over his testimony  encouraging  senators to vote against legislation that would detain criminal illegal migrants. 

“[Laken Riley’s] death is not an actual issue? . . . I just want to make sure the record’s clear on this: The spokesman for the minority party is advising the Senate that the  Laken Riley Act  is a bad idea, ”  Senator Hawley stated, addressing Isacson and all present in the hearing. 

“The spokesman for the minority party is saying that Laken Riley’s death and migrant crime is not an actual issue. . . . [Laken Riley] is dead because of migrant crime,”  Senator Hawley pointed out. 

Watch Senator Hawley’s full remarks  here  , or click on the video above. 

Senator Hawley continued his line of questioning by  debunking  Isacson’s reference to the Trump-era Remain in Mexico program as a “policy of death.”   
  
“I wish the Remain in Mexico program had still been in effect when the killer of Travis Wolfe crossed the border. He might still be alive today,”  Senator Hawley concluded. 

During today’s hearing, Senator Hawley  defended  his new legislation,  “Travis’s Law,”  honoring the legacy of Missouri’s 12-year-old Travis Wolfe, who was killed in a head-on collision by a criminal illegal alien. The legislation—which has been  introduced  as an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  —would prevent illegal aliens, who commit crimes against children, from roaming free. 

Earlier this week—bypassing Isacson’s wishes—the Senate overwhelmingly advanced passage of the  Laken Riley Act  , which Senator Hawley has co-sponsored. The bill would ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains illegal aliens who commit burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.

11:07:29 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the  End Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Providers Act.  The  bill  would defund Planned Parenthood and abortion providers across the nation. 

“Americans have long made it clear that they oppose taxpayer-funded abortions. But the Biden Administration has plowed forward, ensuring that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates receive tens of millions of dollars annually in federal grants,”  Senator Hawley said.  “It’s high time we ended federal support for Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry. My legislation defends the unborn and upholds the will of the American people.” 

President Trump established the “Protect Life Rule” in 2019 to prohibit taxpayer dollars from going toward Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide or refer for abortions. As a result, Planned Parenthood was successfully blocked from receiving $60 million in federal funding. Upon taking office, however, the Biden Administration immediately rescinded this rule and has worked relentlessly to embolden the abortion industry over the past four years. 

The  End Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Providers Act  would: 

  * Prohibit federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other organizations that perform abortions, provide referrals for abortion, or provide funding to other entities that perform abortions   
  
  

  * Provide exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, and for the life of the mother.

Senator Hawley subsequently secured her commitment to investigate the Biden Administration’s spying in churches and who was responsible. 

“In the last four years, this Administration has carried out an unprecedented attack and campaign against people of faith,”  said Senator Hawley  . 

The Biden Admin oversaw the most disgraceful chapter of the DOJ in history: pursuing  attack campaigns  on people of faith by targeting pregnancy centers and churches.

Continuing his fight to  secure passage  of the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  (RECA), Senator Hawley also secured Bondi’s commitment to further look into RECA and the continued issues across Missouri if confirmed as Attorney General.

11:07:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  introduced  “Travis’s Law”  to  honor  the legacy of Missouri’s 12-year-old Travis Wolfe—who was  killed  in a head-on collision by a criminal illegal alien—and prevent other criminal illegal aliens from roaming free. 

Travis was killed by Endrina Bracho, an illegal alien who was driving in the wrong direction at more than double the posted speed limit. Bracho was charged with six criminal counts, including first-degree involuntary manslaughter and operating a vehicle on a highway without a valid license. But just last month, a judge released Bracho after  reducing  her bond pending a future trial. She was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

“Under President Biden’s open border, Missouri’s 12-year-old Travis Wolfe was killed by an illegal alien, who was then released from jail. There’s no legislation less controversial than protecting American citizens from dangerous illegal aliens—and preventing another death like Travis’s,”  said Senator Hawley.  “My amendment,  Travis’s Law  , would guarantee the detention of criminal illegals who commit a motor vehicle crime or victimize a minor.” 

Senator Hawley has introduced  Travis’s Law  as an amendment to the  Laken Riley Act  , legislation which would ensure that ICE detains illegal aliens who commit burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. Earlier this week, the Senate overwhelmingly advanced passage of the  Laken Riley Act  , which Senator Hawley has co-sponsored, by an 82-10 vote. 

Travis would have turned 13 last month had he not been killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving without a valid driver’s license. 

Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student, would have turned 23 just this past Friday had she not been murdered by an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested twice. 

Senator Hawley’s amendment would:   
  


  * Guarantee the detention of illegal aliens who commit crimes which victimize minor children, as well as commit crimes involving the use or operation of motor vehicles.   
  
  

  * Expand the  Laken Riley Act  to ensure more Americans are protected from criminal illegal aliens.

11:07:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  delivered remarks  on the Senate floor emphasizing the need for reform and expansion of the Child Tax Credit to more effectively support and cultivate American families. 

“The test of this Congress will be whether we strengthen America’s families and whether we deliver for America’s working people,”  Senator Hawley said.  “Because in those families lies the hope of this nation, and in those working people resides the wellspring of our great national strength.” 

The Senator condemned the current state of the economy, saying there is something “fundamentally wrong” with an economy where working people cannot afford to have the children that they want or provide for their children through their own labor. 

Watch the full remarks  here  . 

Senator Hawley’s  proposal  would expand the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to reward work, support families, and put tax dollars back in the hands of working parents. His  plan  would increase the current CTC from a maximum of $2,000 per child to $5,000 per child, apply the credit to payroll taxes, and allow families to receive the tax credit in regular installments throughout the year, rather than as a lump sum during tax season. 

Senator Hawley was also one of three Senate Republicans who voted for last year’s  bipartisan tax package  that included an expanded CTC.

11:07:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: It’s time to repeal Biden’s pro-abortion policies and restore Trump’s pro-life legacy at HHS 

By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | January 13, 2024 |  World Magazine 

Inauguration Day is at hand. A new political era awaits. And on Day One, President Donald Trump can set the moral tone for his second term with the stroke of a pen. He can restore the full suite of pro-life policies that his own Department of Health and Human Services developed during his first term. No priority should be—could be—higher than protecting America’s unborn children.   
  
[…]   
  
Many Americans don’t realize just how consequential agency actions truly are. These rules set the direction of policy for the whole of the government—and federal agencies influence policy in the states, too, through extensive grant programs and other means. Because Congress regularly delegates massive authority to federal agencies, the rules and regulations they promulgate carry the force of law. For those reasons, directing the federal bureaucracy is one of the president’s greatest powers.   
  
President Trump should use that power to protect life, just as he did in his first term. In the first Trump administration, HHS advanced a broad slate of pro-life measures critical to defending the unborn.   
  
First, it correctly determined that federal funding for family planning through the Title X grant program shouldn’t mean federal funding for abortion providers. That’s because abortion doesn’t build families—it destroys them.   
  
Second, HHS made pregnancy resource centers eligible to receive federal funding through grants designed for the support of needy families. That’s because these centers—which provide ultrasounds, diapers, counseling, and a host of other resources to expectant mothers, often at no cost—serve as critical lifelines for struggling families across the nation.   
  
Third, President Trump implemented the Mexico City Policy that blocked federal funding to international aid groups that promote abortions. That’s because American foreign aid should be aimed at nurturing life, not ending it. American taxpayers should never be forced to subsidize abortions in other countries.   
  
[…]   
  
Predictably, these achievements came under immediate attack once Joe Biden arrived in the Oval Office. Pro-abortion activists in the Biden administration spent years trying to dismantle President Trump’s work at HHS. In the hands of President Biden, HHS tried to force federal grant recipients to make referrals for abortions, cut off funding for pregnancy resource centers, and use American tax dollars to help pay for abortions overseas.   
  
[…]   
  
Thankfully, it’s a new day. And President Trump has the power to start protecting life again—immediately. He should use that power boldly to protect those who most need it: the innocent unborn.

11:07:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with Representatives Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.), sent a  letter  to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging them to approve the release of a second interim report on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) at the FTC’s Open Commission Hearing on Tuesday, January 14, 2025. 

“PBMs were originally created to handle the prescription drug benefit on behalf of health plans, negotiating directly with drug manufacturers and setting pharmacy networks for their contracted payers,”  the legislators wrote.  “But over the years, these once little-known middlemen have morphed into giant, vertically-integrated conglomerates that control every link in the drug coverage and delivery chain, including pharmacies and health plans.” 

In light of market abuses, the FTC launched an inquiry into the industry in 2022 and required the six largest PBMs to provide information on their business practices and contracts with regard to their impact on prescription drug costs. An interim staff report exposed how the largest PBMs use their size to “employ lopsided and unilateral contracting practices” that force independent community pharmacies to “enter into one-sided, non-negotiable contracts with the leading PBMs.” The report also found that these middlemen have, in some cases, forced patients with insurance to pay an exorbitant out-of-pocket cost far beyond the true price of their prescription drug. 

“The FTC’s interim report helped inform various bipartisan proposals to rein in abuses in the PBM market, including our Patients Before Monopolies (PBM) Act,”  the lawmakers continued.  “We expect a second interim report will shine further light on the industry that will be invaluable to legislators as the policy priorities of the 119th Congress take shape.” 

Senator Hawley has been a vocal supporter of putting patients first and holding PBMs accountable. Last month, he and Sen. Warren introduced the  Patients Before Monopolies Act  to prevent PBMs from owning pharmacies and driving up prescription drug costs for their own benefit. 

The full text of the letter can be found  here  and below. 

Commissioners   
Federal Trade Commission   
600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, D.C. 20580   
  
Dear FTC Commissioners, 

We write in advance of the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) Open Commission Hearing on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, to urge you to vote in support of issuing a second interim staff report on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).   
  
PBMs were originally created to handle the prescription drug benefit on behalf of health plans, negotiating directly with drug manufacturers and setting pharmacy networks for their contracted payers. But over the years, these once little-known middlemen have morphed into giant, vertically-integrated conglomerates that control every link in the drug coverage and delivery chain, including pharmacies and health plans. Numerous federal and state investigations – arising from concerns raised by policymakers and enforcers on both sides of the aisle – have found that the largest PBMs have used their market dominance to overcharge taxpayers and employers, hide profits in overseas entities, and squash competition from independent community pharmacies. Indeed, during President Trump’s first term, he branded PBMs as “famous middlemen” that “rip[] off Medicare patients with high prescription prices.”   
  
Responding to market abuses, in June 2022, the FTC launched an inquiry into the prescription drug middleman industry pursuant to its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, requiring the six largest PBMs to provide information on their business practices and contractual arrangements in order to determine their effect on the affordability of prescription drugs. Notwithstanding delay tactics from PBMs, the FTC released an interim staff report revealing that the six largest PBMs manage nearly 95% of all prescriptions filled in the United States to the detriment of independent pharmacies and patients. The report detailed how the largest PBMs “employ lopsided and unilateral contracting practices” that force unaffiliated pharmacies to “enter into one-sided, non-negotiable contracts with the leading PBMs.” The report also found that these middlemen have sent billions in inflated payments to their pharmacy subsidiaries, “allow[ing] pharmacies affiliated with the three largest PBMs to retain levels of dispensing revenue well above estimated drug acquisition costs,” and in some cases, forcing patients with insurance to pay an unreasonably high out-of-pocket cost that is far beyond to the true cost of their prescription drug.”   
  
The FTC’s interim report helped inform various bipartisan proposals to rein in abuses in the PBM market, including our Patients Before Monopolies (PBM) Act. We expect a second interim report will shine further light on the industry that will be invaluable to legislators as the policy priorities of the 119th Congress take shape. Accordingly, we urge FTC to issue its second interim staff report swiftly and continue investigating the serious effects of the PBM industry on patients, taxpayers, and independent pharmacies.

Senators Luján and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Representatives Veronica Escobar (D-TX), Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) sent a letter to the  Dutch Government  in June, in addition to several meetings and phone calls with relevant stakeholders, including U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal. 

The lawmakers have been working with the Department of State and the Dutch Government to return several cultural and religious artifacts since the Pueblo made numerous, yet unsuccessful, efforts to communicate with the Museum for the objects, which were taken from the Pueblo by Dutch anthropologist Herman F.C. Ten Kate in December of 1882. 

“I am proud that a vital part of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo’s cultural heritage will now be restored with the return of the Pueblo’s most sacred religious objects,”  said Senator Luján  . “I am proud to have urged the Dutch Government, met with Pueblo leaders, and coordinated with U.S. officials to secure the repatriation of these sacred artifacts. I am grateful to see the repatriation of these artifacts and am committed to fighting to protect the cultural heritage of our Tribal communities.” 

“Today’s news rectifies a long injustice for our community,”  said Congresswoman Escobar.  “My team and I have tirelessly worked to return these precious artifacts for over a year. I join everyone from the Pueblo tribe in rejoicing that these artifacts and their history will be preserved for generations to come. I’m grateful to the Dutch Government for their willingness to right this wrong and to the State Department for their help bringing such sacred objects back to their rightful home” 

“Today is a wonderful day. The repatriation of sacred items to Ysleta Del Sur is long overdue. The work done by Pueblo leaders, Rep. Escobar, my colleagues in the New Mexico delegation, and the Biden Administration to secure these artifacts has been tireless. I’m honored to have had the opportunity to support their work,”  said Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury

11:07:37 root         DEBUG    Desc: 21 Senators and 8 Representatives Call on Supreme Court to Uphold the Universal Service Fund, Ensure Rural and Underserved Areas Have Access to Broadband 

Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of upholding the Universal Service Fund (USF), a critical federal program that has reliably supported broadband access in the most rural and underserved areas of the country for nearly 30 years. The Supreme Court’s case,  Consumers’ Research v. FCC,  concerns claims of unconstitutionality in the current funding mechanism for USF and the court’s ruling can potentially cut off broadband service to some of our country’s most underserved areas. 

In the amicus brief, Senators Luján, Fischer, and a group of 27 bipartisan Senators and Representatives argue that Congress has established sufficient universal service policy and principles to direct the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) implementation of the Universal Service programs & contribution mechanism. The Senators also argue that Congress exercises significant oversight of the FCC’s implementation of USF, and the work performed by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) does not undermine political accountability. The Senators state that dismantling USF would have dire consequences for millions of Americans, impeding efforts to close the digital divide. 

“From New Mexico’s rural schools and hospitals to working families in underserved and rural communities, the Universal Service Fund has been instrumental in expanding broadband access across the country,”  said Senator Luján  . “As I argue in my amicus, Congress has already established sufficient policies and guardrails to ensure the FCC stays within its mandate in its implementation of the program. Dismantling USF would be devasting for Americans who have relied on this critical program for decades and would leave millions on the wrong side of the digital divide.” 

“Congress set clear goals for the mission of universal service, and the Universal Service Fund has been fulfilling those goals for nearly 30 years. The fund has extended broadband and communications access to the most unserved parts of our country. I am proud so many of my colleagues in the Senate and House joined this brief highlighting USF’s role in rural America to inform the Court’s decision,”  said Senator Fischer  . 

Joining Senators Luján and Fischer in submitting the amicus brief are Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Angus King (I-Maine), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Representatives James Clyburn (D-S.C.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), Nick Begich (R-Ala.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), and Brad Finstad (R-Minn.). 

Senator Luján has long worked to support and improve the Universal Service Fund and expand broadband access. In March 2023, Senator Luján  reintroduced  the Funding Affordable Internet with Reliable (FAIR) Contributions Act, legislation that would direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct a study into the feasibility of collecting Universal Service Fund contributions from internet edge providers. In May 2023, Senator Luján  announced  a bipartisan, bicameral working group to evaluate and propose potential reforms to the Universal Service Fund. 

A copy of the amicus brief is available  here  .

11:07:44 root         DEBUG    Desc: WATCH HERE  : Treasury Secretary Nominee Won’t Commit to Not Recommending Cuts to Health Care for Americans 

Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, pressed Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent on a number of issues important to New Mexicans, including preserving health care for children, seniors, and people with disabilities; funding Head Start and broadband programs; and continuing the Biden administration’s efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis. 

KEY MOMENTS: 

Sen. Luján: It may surprise many observing today the immense responsibility the Secretary of the Treasury has in stemming the flow of fentanyl and other substances. Yes, or no, will you commit to continuing the Biden administration’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force, which brought together the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and IRS Criminal Investigation to fight financial crime? 

  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “I will commit.” 

Sen. Luján: Mr. Bessent, Yes or no, will you work with me to ensure there is more transparency for over Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for Congress? 

  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “Yes.” 

Sen. Luján: Mr. Bessent in your role as Treasury Secretary, do you agree that you will play an important part in advising President Trump and Congressional Republicans on policy related to the economy, including investment in government programs? 

  
Mr. Bessent: “Yes, Senator.” 

Sen. Luján: I was pleased in our meeting that you stated that “no cuts will be needed” to achieve your economic goals. I think that might surprise some of my Republican colleagues, but I very much appreciate that conversation we had. Yes or no, will you recommend cutting Medicaid?    
  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “It’s the business of Congress to do the budget. I am in favor of empowering states and I believe that for some states that will be an increase and for some states that will be a decrease.” 

So, Mr. Bessent, will you recommend cutting Medicaid to President Trump? And I’ll remind you that you acknowledged that one of your responsibilities as Secretary of the Treasury will be providing this advice. 

  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “I will get back to you on this.” 

Sen. Luján: Will you recommend cuts to the broadband following the investments we’ve been seeing across the country making immense progress in connecting more people across the country that was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law? 

  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “I will get back to you on that.” 

Sen. Luján: Well Mr. Bessent, a lot of folks back in South Carolina, including some of your farming neighbors are getting connectivity because of these programs and you may need to chat with them about the importance of what this program means. 

As my time expires, it might surprise many here that there’s only a couple of us in this body that are members of Head Start, and I imagine we may hear a little more about that from my brother in Head Start, Mr. Warnock. When we talk about the importance of early education in America, the economic benefit, yes or no, will you recommend cuts to Head Start?   
  
Mr. Bessent, in part: “I will have to get back to you on this. I don’t understand the intricacies of this program.” 

Sen. Luján: Do you know what Head Start is? 

You have to qualify to get into the program. So, the family I was raised in, we qualified to get into the program. It opens up doors. It got a couple of us to the United States Senate. So, I certainly hope we can find some sort of agreement in protecting that program and if someone tries to eliminate that and early childhood education that we can count on you on behalf of New Mexicans and South Carolinians and people across America to say no, we’re not going to do that.

11:07:49 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-18
11:07:49 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined Senate Democrats and delivered remarks on the Senate Floor calling out the Republican Tax Scam that gives a handout to the country’s most wealthy on the backs of working people by dramatically cutting funding for programs that all Americans rely on like health, education, and public services. 

Watch Senator Luján’s floor speech  here  . 

Senator Luján’s floor speech, as prepared for delivery, is below: 

I want to start by giving thanks to our colleague from Hawaii for asking us to come together to have a conversation with the American people. I’m a proud Senator from the state of New Mexico. From a small rural community in the northern part of the state, and I wanted to come down to the floor to continue this conversation as we have heard from colleagues already talk about what this is and what this isn’t. 

It seems to me when my Republican colleagues last did this, what I heard townhall after townhall across New Mexico is that Democrats, Republicans, Independents, voters, constituents, they just want to hear the truth. They want to hear what this is and what this is not. 

I’m going to start off by holding this report that says that almost $60 billion a year of the benefit of extending the Republican tax policies will go to the top 0.1% of the wealthiest in America. 

0.1%, I’m not talking about the other 99.9%. Let’s define how much money people that are in the top 0.1% in America are making. They’re doing very well. They’re making $2.8 million per year. That’s a lot of money. 

But, under the guise of giving middle class families, hard-working families all across America a tax cut, where the benefit goes to the top 0.1%, where you’re making $2.8 million per year, this is for you. The American people just want to hear the truth.   
  
This is not for the hard-working families back home. My brothers and sisters, police, men and women who fight to keep us safe, EMS who respond when we need them the most, nurses, teacher, electricians, iron workers, pipefitters, all the folks across America who are doing everything they can to put some food on the table. Keep a roof over their head. Provide for their kids. Maybe save for retirement if they have a little extra. 

They are playing by the rules, this golden rule promise that if you fight hard and play by the rules, you will do better than the previous generation and you’ll help your kids and everyone that follows you. 

So, while you are playing by the rules all across the country, and I’m talking to everyone not making $2.8 million per year, Senate Republicans are getting ready to rig the system with a tax scam that’s going to give more money to the top 0.1%. People who are making $2.8 million a year or more. 

The top 0.1% are the people who are making $2.8 million a year. 

Maybe that will let them buy another yacht or jet plane. 

One of the concerns across the country is just like this happened before, my Senate Republican colleagues are going to do this behind closed doors all while making false promises this is for you. Working class families all across America. 

But at the end of the night, all they’re going to stick you with the bill. 

And they will make you pay for it by eliminating programs that support our veterans, feeding young children and babies, and take care of grandparents and elders. Or giving up your child’s ability to see the same doctor they’ve had since being born. 

Studies show just extending this Republican Tax Scam would blow a $4 trillion hole in the deficit. Let that sink in. Facts. Talking about what this will and will not do. 

The incoming Administration is going to try and pass this off as a ‘middle-class tax cut’. That is how they are going to sell this to the American people. 

It’s not. It’s a handout to the wealthiest folks making more than $2.8 million per year. 

Economic analysis makes it clear that this tax scam will drive up the debt and leave working families behind. 

We all know the way to grow the economy is to invest in the working class, lower taxes for working families, and bring industry and innovation back to our communities. 

The success of our teachers, nurses, pipefitters, firefighters, police officers, and everyone in between is the success in building up the economy across America. 

Look, you’ve heard this from my Democratic colleagues, I am ready to work with my Republican colleagues to find better solutions for growing our economy and lowering taxes to prioritize the middle class, to help them. But this scam is horrible. It’s why I wanted to come to the floor today to have a conversation with my colleagues to share the facts about what is happening here with the American people and let my colleagues across the aisle know – let’s work together. Let’s truly deliver on a promise to help hard-working middle-class families all across the country. Including in the state of New Mexico. 

I want to thank you again Senator Schatz and I want to yield my time to my colleague from Vermont who I had the honor of serving with in the House and being apart of this debate when this happened before. 

Thank you and I yield back my time.

“Today, I participated in a productive confirmation hearing for former Congressman Sean Duffy to serve as U.S. Secretary of Transportation. During the hearing, Mr. Duffy and I had a conversation regarding the importance of ending drunk driving once and for all and his commitment to expediting the implementation of the HALT/RIDE Act that I passed into law. As I have done with previous nominees, I am committed to evaluating his credentials in a fair and thorough process.” 

Video of Senator Luján’s exchange with former Congressman Sean Duffy is available  here  . 

An excerpt of Senator Luján’s opening remarks is available below: 

Mr. Duffy, thanks for being with us today and for your focus on safety throughout your testimony. If I heard you correctly, you told Senator Cruz that you want your legacy as Secretary of Transportation to be improving safety. I cannot think of a more noble and important priority in your work than making our country safer for our families and for our communities. 

I also want to say thank you for sharing your wife Rachel’s story. I know firsthand how hard it is to speak about these tragedies and these traumas. Thirty years ago, I was hit head on by a drunk driver. Thank God you’re here. Thank God I survived. It took me a long time to even learn how to tell my story. It still brings back these memories whenever you even think about it. 

It’s one of the reasons I introduced the HALT/RIDE Act with my colleagues. I want to thank the chair [Acting Chair Capito] because she has been a steadfast leader on getting this done. I introduced legislation that I believe will dramatically end, dramatically reduce not just drunk driving deaths, but distracted deaths and crashes across America. 

Background on Senator Luján’s work to keep our roadways safe: 

Senator Luján is a longtime advocate of comprehensive safety measures to save lives and keep our roadways safe. In 2021, Luján  championed  the HALT/RIDE Act, which was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and implements drunk and impaired driving measures to prevent drunk driving and help save thousands of lives each year. In March 2024, Luján  called on the U.S. Department of Transportation  to swiftly move forward with its rulemaking process to implement the HALT/RIDE Act, and to do so in a way that protects’ drivers privacy.

11:08:04 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-18
11:08:04 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) announced  $120 million  for Fiscal Year 2025 for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project using funding from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Reclamation Water Settlements Fund. 

The Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project was first authorized in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which settled the Navajo Nation’s water rights in the San Juan River Basin of New Mexico. Upon completion, this project will provide a sustainable water supply from the San Juan River to roughly 43 Chapters of the Navajo Nation, the southwestern portion of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and the City of Gallup, all of which currently rely on a rapidly diminishing groundwater supply. 

In August, the N.M. Delegation was pleased to welcome a $267 million Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project contract to design and build the San Juan Lateral Water Treatment Plant in northwest New Mexico. The plant is the largest and most important feature of the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project.  Together with today’s announcement, the total investment for the project is $487 million. 

“Access to safe, reliable drinking water is a basic right and crucial for public health. That’s why I’m proud to have helped secure $120 million for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. I’m grateful to Secretary Haaland and the Department of the Interior for their support,”  said Luján, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.  “This issue has been a priority for me since I introduced the original Navajo-Gallup Water Supply legislation in the House of Representatives. I also introduced legislation to amend the project, ensuring it has the resources and time needed to deliver clean drinking water to communities in northwestern New Mexico. I previously secured $137 million for the project through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I’ll continue working to complete this project. This is an issue of living up to our trust responsibility to Tribes and delivering essential rights to Nations. This is a critical step forward and I remain committed to fighting for Tribes and Pueblos.” 

“Today, we are delivering on our promise to the Navajo Nation to fund this infrastructure project that will deliver clean, reliable water to 43 Tribal communities and the City of Gallup. We secured significant investments for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project through our Infrastructure Law. Now it’s time we get the project fully completed,”  said Ranking Member Heinrich.  “Communities in northwest New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation deserve water security and clean drinking water. I am committed to delivering the resources families need and deserve.” 

“We worked hard to raise the funding ceiling for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project in the contentious end of year funding fight because we knew this $120 million would get us a step closer to delivering clean, reliable water to communities on the Navajo Nation, Jicarilla Apache Nation, and across northwestern New Mexico,”  said Leger Fernández.  “This long-term project will bring drinking water to 250,000 people and the completion of this water project is essential for upholding our federal trust responsibility to Tribal nations. This project also benefits the surrounding communities of Gallup and allows hospitals and key improvements to be built. I will keep fighting to provide the infrastructure to sustain New Mexican communities for generations to come.” 

“I want to thank Senator Heinrich, Senator Luján, and Rep. Leger Fernández for their tireless advocacy on behalf of the Navajo Nation and for securing the language in the Continuing Resolution to allow this funding to become possible. With this funding, we are even closer to bringing a safe and reliable water supply to our people. We are confident that with their advocacy that Congress will pass the entirety of the Navajo Gallup Water Supply Project Amendments Act,”  Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said. 

“For many years, the City of Gallup has relied on dwindling groundwater resources that are increasingly expensive and difficult to develop,”  said Mayor Louie Bonaguidi.  “Water from the San Juan River constitutes the only available and economically viable long term supply, and is therefore essential to — and guarantees — the City’s future. In economic terms, the project is a ‘game changer’ for the City. We are very happy that Congresswomen Leger-Fernández and Stansbury, Senators Luján and Heinrich, and other members of the State’s delegation, working with the Bureau of Reclamation, have been able to secure additional funding for the project.”

11:08:30 root         DEBUG    Titles: Beyer Announces Reintroduction Of Legislation To End Tax Breaks For Oil And Gas Industry
11:08:30 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:08:30 root         DEBUG    Desc: U.S. Representative Don Beyer today announced the reintroduction, with Reps. Sean Casten (IL-06) and Mike Levin (CA-49), of the End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act. The legislation would eliminate a series of tax breaks enjoyed by the oil and gas industry. 

“It is crazy, dangerous, and a stupid waste of money for the federal government to keep subsidizing fossil fuels with taxpayer money when we have just reached the 1.5°C global warming threshold and the ten hottest years on record were all in the last decade,”  said Rep. Beyer.  “I have heard colleagues rail for years against ‘the government picking winners and losers’ when we use the tax code to support a clean energy transition, yet many of those most fiercely opposed to building green jobs with tax credits fiercely guard tax subsidies for massively profitable oil companies. Those tax credits are terrible policy in every way and we should end them permanently.” 

“According to the International Monetary Fund, the fossil fuel industry receives  $757 billion  a year in direct and indirect tax subsidies from the United States,”  said Rep. Casten  . “In the last decade, we have seen the fossil fuel industry teetering on the verge of irrelevance because it cannot compete with cleaner, cheaper energy sources, but it’s been kept afloat by these subsidies. I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Reps. Beyer and Levin to unrig our energy markets, lower emissions, and protect public health.” 

“California is experiencing some of the most devastating wildfires in our country’s history, and these fires are made worse by climate change,”  said Rep. Levin  . “While California burns, the oil and gas companies responsible for accelerating the climate crisis continue to receive billions of dollars in tax subsidies every year, all while making record profits. Ending these corporate giveaways will help us fight the climate crisis, hold those who are responsible accountable, and help the U.S. invest in clean energy.” 

Despite consistent profitability, fossil fuel companies receive billions of dollars in federal tax breaks and subsidies, which underwrite the costs of continued oil and gas production. The forgone revenues undermine the United States’ ability to combat the climate crisis and invest in critical initiatives like education, housing, infrastructure, and healthcare. The subsidies also distort the energy market, creating an unfair and economically-inefficient advantage for polluting fuels against solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and hydro power. 

The End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act, previously sponsored by retired Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), would amend the Internal Revenue Code by: 

  * Increasing the amortization period for geological and geophysical expenditures from two years to seven years; 
  * Repealing the Section 45I tax credit for producing oil and gas from marginal wells and the Section 43 tax credit for enhanced oil recovery; 
  * Repealing the Section 263(c) tax deduction for the intangible drilling and development costs of oil and gas wells; 
  * Repealing percentage depletion in Section 613A; 
  * Repealing the Section 193 tax deduction for tertiary injectant expenses; 
  * Repealing the exception to passive loss limitations for working interests in oil and gas property. 



Text of the  End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act  can be found  here  . 

Rep. Beyer serves on the House Ways and Means Tax Subcommittee and is Vice Chair of the Sustainable Energy & Environment Coalition.

11:08:32 root         DEBUG    Titles: DelBene, Beyer Introduce Legislation to Block President from Imposing Unchecked Tariffs
11:08:32 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:08:32 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Representatives Suzan DelBene (WA-01) and Don Beyer (VA-08) led 11 House members in introducing the Prevent Tariff Abuse Act, legislation to stop the President of the United States from imposing import tariffs  under the guise of a national emergency  without Congressional approval. 

Tariffs are taxes paid by importers that are often passed along to consumers through higher prices. Donald Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail and during the presidential transition that he would impose sweeping  tariffs of 10-20% on all imported goods  into the U.S., against some of our largest trading partners including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. Tariffs like the ones Trump is proposing are estimated to directly raise prices on consumer goods by  $2,600  to  $4,000  a year for the average American family – at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy counter. Canada, our largest trading partner, has announced that it is currently  preparing to retaliate  against U.S. companies and their workers if these tariffs are put in place, an example of how countries will respond to Trump’s tariff-first trade agenda. 

The president has the authority to declare emergencies in response to national security or economic threats under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The law was intended to allow presidents to impose financial sanctions on hostile foreign nations that pose an emergency threat to the nation. It was never intended to allow a president to  declare a state of national economic emergency  and impose tariffs on allies. 

“The American people have clearly and consistently said that the high cost of living is one of their top concerns. Imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods would raise prices on consumer products by thousands of dollars a year. Not only would widespread tariffs drive up costs at home and likely send our economy into recession, but they would likely lead to significant retaliation, hurting American workers, farmers, and businesses. This is especially true in Washington where 4-in-10 jobs are trade-dependent,”  said DelBene  . “The law was never intended to be abused in this way. This legislation would ensure that Congress can prevent overly broad emergency powers and establish critical oversight to prevent any president from arbitrarily imposing tariffs that increase costs for Americans.” 

“I have warned during both Democratic and Republican administrations that Congress has ceded far too much authority to the Executive Branch to unilaterally raise tariffs, but Donald Trump’s willingness to abuse those authorities poses particular risk of chaos and damage to the U.S. economy,”  said Beyer  . “Trump’s tariff proposals would misuse emergency authorities to raise prices on the American people, which is unacceptable. Congress must put its foot down and restore the balance of powers that our Founders intended for our trade policy, which is exactly what our bill would do.” 

The Constitution clearly states that “Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties … and to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and no president, Democrat or Republican, should have the power to raise taxes on the American people without the consent of Congress. DelBene’s bill would clarify that the imposition of duties or quotas on the importation of goods is prohibited under IEEPA. 

DelBene and Beyer are joined by Representatives Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Brad Schneider (IL-10), Judy Chu (CA-28), John Larson (CT-01), Terri Sewell (AL-07), Andrea Salinas (OR-06), Rick Larsen (WA-02), Tim Kennedy (NY-26), and Steven Horsford (NV-11). 

A copy of the bill can be found  here  .

11:09:16 root         DEBUG    Titles: Cassidy, Risch Introduce Bill to Block ATF's Ability to Deny Firearm, Ammunition Imports
11:09:16 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:09:16 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced the Sporting Firearms Access Act to stop the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) from arbitrarily blocking imports of firearms and ammunition. The Sporting Firearms Access Act clarifies the definition of “sporting purposes” used by the ATF to regulate the import of firearms into the U.S. to recognize firearms and ammunition used for activities such as hunting, target shooting, and competitions. 

“Louisiana is a sportsman’s paradise, but Joe Biden’s ATF is trying to punish law-abiding Louisianans who are exercising their Second Amendment rights,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “Changing the definition protects Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights and enjoying our paradise.” 

“The ATF will stop at nothing to put a chokehold on law-abiding gun owners’ Second Amendment rights. Barring the import of firearms for legal sporting activities is bureaucratic red tape at its finest,”  said Senator Risch.  “My Sporting Firearms Access Act sets the ATF’s definition of sporting purposes straight to ensure Idaho’s hunters, skeet shooters, and sportsmen are not denied the import of firearms or ammunition to enjoy these pastimes.” 

Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, firearms and ammunition can only be imported if the ATF recognizes it as being suitable for “sporting purposes.” Ambiguity in the law has allowed the ATF to arbitrarily deny imports of firearms by U.S. customers and businesses. The Sporting Firearms Access Act would prohibit the ATF from denying items that are substantially similar to those in circulation in the U.S. and require the agency to work with the firearms industry to determine what items are suitable for sporting purposes. The bill also provides an appeals process for wrongful determinations and a means for judicial review. 

Cassidy and Risch were joined by U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), and Ted Budd (R-NC) in introducing the legislation. 

The Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation and the National Shooting Sports Foundation support this legislation. 

Background 

Last week, Cassidy reintroduced the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act to allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any other state that allows concealed carry alongside 43 Republican colleagues.  Learn more here  . 

Last Congress, Cassidy was named to the National Shooting Sports Foundation’s “Dean’s List,” which recognizes lawmakers who have gone above and beyond the A+ rating to protect Second Amendment rights.  Learn more here  .

11:09:17 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:09:17 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Republican colleagues introduced  Sarah’s Law  to honor the memory of Sarah Root and amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. 

“If a drunk American had killed someone while driving three times over the legal drinking limit, they would not have been set free. Why are illegal immigrants being treated differently?”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “Sarah’s death was terrible. Her family not getting justice is unacceptable.” 

“Sarah Root had her entire life ahead of her before it was senselessly taken by someone who never should have been in this country,”  said Senator Ernst.  “Her family has been forced to endure a living nightmare without closure because a glaring loophole in the law has allowed her killer to remain on the run for nearly nine years. For years, I have worked tirelessly to pass Sarah’s Law to honor her memory, hold illegal immigrants that cause bodily harm to our citizens accountable, and ensure this never happens again. I will not give up this fight for justice, because our laws should not prioritize illegal immigrants over the safety of Americans.” 

“This law is to make sure no other family has to go through what our family has. We are coming up on 9 years since our beautiful Sarah was taken from us and there is no reason this law shouldn’t have passed within that time. Sarah’s killer is still on the run and if this law was in place when she was killed, we wouldn’t be looking for her killer today – he would be in custody and serving his time,”  said Sarah’s mother, Michelle Root. 

Sarah’s Law will work in tandem with the Laken Riley Act to close loopholes in federal law that have caused a regular occurrence of innocent Americans falling victim to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. It also requires that upon encountering an illegal immigrant subject to mandatory detention, ICE must make reasonable efforts to identify victims and inform their families of certain information. 

Cassidy and Ernst were joined by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Katie Britt (R-AL), James Lankford (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ted Budd (R-NC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), Jim Risch (R-ID), John Curtis (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and John Kennedy (R-LA) in introducing this legislation. 

Background: 

On January 31, 2016, the night of her college graduation, Sarah Root, a 21-year-old from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit. Due to a loophole in federal law, her killer, Edwin Mejia, was released on bond and never seen again. 

Cassidy  cosponsored  the Laken Riley Act both this year and last Congress as well and calling for its immediate consideration.

11:09:18 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:09:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) reintroduced legislation aimed at improving health care for expectant mothers. The  Connected Maternal Online Monitoring (MOM) Act  requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide coverage recommendations for remote devices such as those that can check for irregularities in blood pressure, blood glucose, and pulse rates which can be indicators of potential pregnancy complications. It also requires CMS to update state resources, such as state Medicaid telehealth toolkits, to correspond with the recommendations provided. The goal is to improve maternal and infant outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women. 

“Maternal mortality is preventable and far too common in Louisiana, particularly in underserved communities,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “The Connected MOM Act allows high-risk mothers to stay home while her doctor monitors her and her baby’s health remotely. This makes sure childbirth is a safe, happy experience for mothers and families.” 

“Too many women across New Hampshire and our country face significant barriers to accessing regular prenatal and postpartum care – whether because they live in rural communities, struggle with childcare, or juggle demanding work and family responsibilities,”  said Senator Hassan.  “Our bipartisan legislation recognizes how medical technology can help bridge these gaps, making it easier for women to access remote monitoring tools that can help detect potential pregnancy complications early. I will continue working across the aisle to address our maternal health crisis and ensure that every woman receives the health care she needs.” 

The bill was inspired by the Connected Maternity Online Monitoring program established by Ochsner Health headquartered in New Orleans. Ochsner provides program participants with equipment for at-home checks to both catch potential issues early and reduce the number of in-person clinic visits. 

“The Connected Maternal Online Monitoring (MOM) Act is crucial to help advance health outcomes and improve the lives of mothers and their children across the nation, and we continue to support Senator Cassidy’s efforts to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation. At Ochsner Health, we are proud of the innovations that our digital maternal health programs have made to support and provide access to patient monitoring of blood pressure and other vital signs that have the potential to save lives. Ochsner endorses the expansion of these programs that make maternal care a priority. We thank Senators Cassidy and Hassan for their support and leadership on this public health issue that has far-reaching impacts to make healthcare more accessible,”  said Ochsner Health CEO Pete November. 

The legislation  passed  the U.S. Senate last year by voice vote with overwhelming support.

11:09:21 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:09:21 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) had a positive exchange with President-elect Trump’s nominee for U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary, Governor Doug Burgum, at his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee. Under the Biden administration, offshore energy development has been restricted. Cassidy and Burgum discussed the importance of reviving offshore energy to protect American jobs, reduce energy prices, and bolster national security.   
  
“[Revenue sharing from offshore energy is] a middle class and lower economic class benefit program because those things are touching services, aside from the jobs being created, directly impacting the quality of life,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “Can I get a commitment from you, as much as you can possibly do it, that when we have lease sales now, they will be as they are scheduled?”   
  
“As someone who is participating in a lawsuit, suing the federal government to try to get them to hold the lease sales when they were supposed to be held by law, you can count that as head of Interior, we will be following the law when it comes to lease sales,”  said Governor Burgum.    
  
“I think the operative statement is you’ll be following the law, and that’s a good thing,”  replied Dr. Cassidy.    
  
Separately, when discussing Cassidy’s  Foreign Pollution Fee Act  , Burgum also noted that Cassidy was spot on that President Trump plans to use tariffs to hold other countries accountable for unfair trade practices.   
  
“One thing that I’ve been concerned about is that countries like China do not enforce international standards on controlling pollution. That lowers their cost of manufacturing as much as 20%, incentivizing manufacturers to leave our country and move there,”  said Dr. Cassidy.    
  
“One thing I have been proposing—Senator Graham is my cosponsor—is a Foreign Pollution Fee that would put a fee on certain products from a country like China roughly equal to their voided cost of not complying with environmental regulations. As [President Trump] speaks about tariffs, this would be a tariff that would be thoroughly defeasible,”  continued Dr. Cassidy  .   
  
“I think you are spot on to recognize President Trump, who has a willingness to use tariffs,”  said Governor Burgum.  “His principle is reciprocity. If you have access to our markets and we don’t have access to yours or if you are using unfair practices, if you are dumping… that is exactly the kind of place [President Trump] has publicly spoken about that he would want to have reciprocity with tariffs.”   
  
Background    
Today, Cassidy  introduced  his Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025 to require the U.S. DOI to hold two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years. 2024 was the first time in over 50 years there was not a single lease sale held in the Gulf of Mexico.   
  
Last Congress, the ENR Committee passed Cassidy’s  RISEE Act  to increase funding from offshore energy revenue sharing that Louisiana uses for coastal restoration   
  
He also pushed back on disastrous proposals from the Biden administration to limit development in the Outer Continental Shelf by introducing the  WHALE Act  , the  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2023  , and the  Supporting Made in America Energy Act  to mandate oil and gas lease sales.   
  
  
Last month, Cassidy and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)  released  a new discussion draft of their Foreign Pollution Fee Act to level the playing field with Chinese manufacturing and expand American production for public comment. In addition, the Steel Manufacturers Association, which represents 70% of the nation’s steel production,  called  on President-elect Trump and Congress to institute a foreign pollution fee.   
  
The Foreign Pollution Fee Act was a key topic at Cassidy’s  Louisiana Energy Security Summit  . The summit featured ten panels that explored protecting U.S. interests from unfair trade practices, Louisiana’s low-emission manufacturing advantage, and the role of natural gas in strengthening U.S. geopolitical influence. Panelists included presidents and CEOs from Entergy, First Solar, Buzzi UnicemUSA, Orsted, and Aluminum Technologies, former Trump administration officials, and leaders from Louisiana trade associations and major energy and Fortune 500 companies.   
  
In 2023, the Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives unanimously adopted a resolution urging Congress to pursue an industrial manufacturing and trade policy to counter competition from China.  Learn more here  .

11:09:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today highlighted his plans to hold China accountable through his  Foreign Pollution Fee  and his plan to save Social Security from insolvency during U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent’s confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. 

“I’ve been very concerned that countries like China manipulate environmental regulations. You point out that they are building hundreds of coal fire plants,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “When we met, we discussed the Foreign Pollution Fee, which would put a levy—a tariff—on those carbon intensive products coming from countries like China… it’s clearly a way [China] is manipulating the world economy to steal jobs from the United States.” 

“I think this is a very interesting idea, that it could be part of an entire tariff program,”  replied Bessent  . 

Cassidy also discussed the urgent need to address Social Security insolvency, noting that the Social Security Trust Fund is expected to go insolvent in approximately eight years. 

“I and others have a bipartisan plan that would create a pension investment fund, separate from the Social Security Trust Fund, and just like we do with our 401k’s, invest it in the broader economy and use the proceeds from that to offset the upcoming 25% cut in Social Security benefits that will occur if we don’t address this problem,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “[O]ther advisors to the incoming president have spoken of creating an investment fund.” 

“One of the tragedies of this blowout in the budget deficit is we have to get our short-term house in order to start, before we can start [sic] implementing the smart plans such as yours,”  said Bessent.  “I do believe that there is discussion to leverage the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet… that is very much in the mix.” 

“If confirmed, this is something that I think could be very exciting, because we always look at the debt of the United States, and we have fantastic assets that could be earning, leveraged, or used for multiple revenue generating opportunities,”  concluded Bessent. 

Background 

Last month, Cassidy and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)  released  a new discussion draft of their Foreign Pollution Fee Act to level the playing field with Chinese manufacturing and expand American production for public comment.

On Social Security, Cassidy has  led  a bipartisan working group to preserve and protect Social Security. Last Congress, he released the inaugural  Bill on the Hill video  where he asked Capitol Hill visitors from across the country their thoughts on the looming benefit cuts to Social Security and presented his “Big Idea.” 

Cassidy successfully  led the effort to hold a Senate vote  on the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) last month as well.  In July  and again  earlier this month  , Cassidy spoke on the U.S. Senate floor urging Congress to repeal WEP and GPO as part of his “Big Idea” to save, strengthen, and secure America’s retirement system. In June, Cassidy  entered  a statement into the record urging the repeal of WEP and GPO ahead of the U.S. Senate Finance Subcommittee field hearing on Social Security.

11:09:22 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:09:22 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, led the introduction of the  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025  . The legislation requires the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years. It is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Katie Britt (R-AL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS). 

“The Biden administration shut down offshore energy development. 2024 was the first time in over 50 years there was not a single lease sale held in the Gulf,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “This distinctly violates the law, costs thousands of Louisiana jobs, drives up oil prices, and empowers foreign dictators. We’re putting an end to this.” 

“It is past time to unleash American energy dominance. Alabama’s Gulf Coast plays an essential role in fueling our nation and supporting our military readiness—I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to reverse leftwing policies and reckless federal overreach in order to drive down costs for hardworking Alabama families,”  said Senator Britt. 

“For the last four years, the Biden administration has waged war on American energy. This intentional attack has depleted our domestic energy supply and made us dependent on foreign adversaries. Offshore energy development in the Gulf of Mexico is essential to our nation’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, offering immense economic, national security, and environmental advantages. We need to fully tap into our abundant energy resources, including in the Gulf. I’m proud to join Senator Cassidy in this effort, and will continue working with the Trump administration to restore America’s energy independence,”  said Senator Tuberville.    
  
“Offshore energy production in the Gulf of Mexico is vital to our economic and national security,”  said Senator Hyde-Smith.  “The Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025 will help ensure that our resources are being properly managed to better the lives of Mississippians and the nation by unleashing American energy dominance.” 

The current five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drafted under the Biden-Harris administration only suggests three lease sales over five years. Given that 2024 was the last year without an offshore lease sale in more than 50 years, it is important to provide long-term leasing certainty that companies can rely on. 

In addition to mandating sales, the bill also defines acreage, stipulates lease terms and conditions, defines which previously finalized environmental reviews will apply to the sales, and ensures that both issued leases and drilling permit applications are not either invalidated, remanded, or delayed as a result of civil litigation. The bill also codifies President Trump’s 2020 memorandum to withdraw the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from leasing for the duration of the legislation. 

The Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025  : 

  * Mandates two offshore oil and gas lease sales per year for 10 years; 
  * Provides certainty to offshore energy producers to continue investing in the United States; and 
  * Codifies President Trump’s 2020 memorandum on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. 



The legislation is supported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA), Gulf Energy Alliance (GEA), and Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA). 

“Energy development on federal waters is critical not only to meeting current and future energy demand, but also for supporting American jobs, local economies and conservation programs. We applaud Sen. Cassidy for standing up for American energy and working to ensure a steady and predictable offshore leasing program,”  said API Vice President of Upstream Policy Holly Hopkins. 

“NOIA thanks Senator Cassidy for his efforts to provide congressional direction to the national OCS leasing program. By explicitly codifying annual lease sales with competitive stipulations that protect the environment and return fair value to taxpayers, the OESA will ensure oil and gas development resumes in the Central and Western U.S. Gulf for the next decade. Speedy passage of this legislation has never been more critical with the largest offshore drilling ban in U.S. history enacted just weeks ago by President Biden,”  said  NOIA President Erik Milito. 

“The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA) strongly supports the Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025, a critical step toward ensuring the stability and growth of energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. This legislation not only secures our national energy independence but also sustains the Gulf South economy by creating operational certainty, supporting thousands of high-wage jobs, and contributing significantly to state and local revenues. We urge Congress to pass this vital bill to maintain the energy security and economic prosperity of our region and nation,”  said  LMOGA President Tommy Faucheux 

“Senator Cassidy recognizes the critical need for predictable and regular lease sales in federal waters off Louisiana’s coast. The Gulf Energy Alliance (GEA) commends his leadership in introducing the Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025, which mandates at least two area-wide offshore lease sales annually. The GEA, a coalition of leading independent offshore oil and natural gas producers, depends on these lease sales and policies that promote sustainable investment, innovation, and job creation in the Gulf of Mexico. Following President Biden’s removal of over 625 million acres of offshore waters from oil and gas development, this legislation is vital to driving additional investments and ensuring the production of the world’s cleanest oil. The offshore energy industry is essential to America’s energy independence and global leadership. Senator Cassidy’s bill will solidify the nation’s position as an energy powerhouse for years to come,”  said  GEA Executive Director Kevin Bruce 

“CEA applauds Senator Cassidy for introducing the Offshore Energy Security Act of 2025 that mandates offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico. This is a critical step forward in strengthening American energy security at a time when families, small business, and manufacturers need stable and affordable energy. It is unconscionable that leasing in the Gulf of Mexico has been limited over that past several years, causing market uncertainty, increasing U.S. inflation, negatively impacting consumers, harming U.S. national security. Senator Cassidy is right to step up to help ensure we can keep energy prices down and energy security strong. CEA looks forward to working with Congress to quickly pass this commonsense legislation and sending it to the President for his signature,”  said CEA Vice President Kaitlin Hammons

11:09:24 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:09:24 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Alex Padilla (D-CA) reintroduced the  Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act  to improve temporary housing available to disaster victims after a storm and wildfire. The bill instructs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to construct disaster-resilient housing within 90 days that can be used to transition into affordable housing under a local public housing authority or affordable housing program to ensure long-term use of the structure. 

“Leaving disaster victims without a roof over their heads is not an option. We must change the way we respond to storms and wildfires,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “This is a better way to provide more resilient and longer-lasting housing that allows communities to recover quickly.” 

“Southern California wildfires have burnt thousands of homes to the ground and left impacted families without stable housing when they need it most,”  said Senator Padilla.  “Our bipartisan legislation would help disaster survivors build back faster and stronger by expanding disaster housing options, expediting assistance, and increasing long-term affordable housing opportunities.” 

Under current law, FEMA provides temporary housing solutions for disaster victims through the Individuals and Households Program, which provides mobile homes for short-term housing for up to 18 months. 

Under Cassidy’s bill, disaster victims would still have access to mobile homes but would be given the opportunity to transition into disaster-resilient single-family housing structures of four units or less. The new housing would resemble typical affordable housing. To ensure quality and livability, the home construction standards are consistent with federal standards on permanent housing, including those for flood management and natural disaster resilience. 

Once the disaster has ended and all disaster victims have returned to their permanent homes, the property would then be transitioned to a local public housing agency or private affordable housing program to create a new long-term affordable housing supply. 

Background 

In 2023, Cassidy introduced two bills to improve federal disaster responses. The  Reforming Disaster Recovery Act  takes recommendations from the U.S. HUD Office of the Inspector General and Government Accountability Office to establish a permanent and predictable funding process. The  Disaster Learning and Life Saving Act  creates an independent board to investigate major natural disasters nationwide. The National Disaster Safety Board would specifically study the underlying causes of disaster-related fatalities and property damage and make recommendations to all levels of government on how to make communities more resilient to the impacts of disasters.

11:09:25 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:09:25 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today questioned President Trump-elect’s nominee for U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary, Chris Wright, at his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee. Cassidy and Wright had a positive exchange about strengthening our national security by unleashing the abundance of American energy, holding foreign advisories accountable, and bringing prosperity back for American energy and American workers. Cassidy released the following statement after today’s hearing: 

“[A]s we offshore [carbon emissions], we offshore the jobs. And that prosperity we are trying to build for working Americans we lose to a working Chinese. Now they don’t enforce environmental regulations, so their SO  x  , NO  x  , and [other pollutants] blow over on us when we are trying to do it right, and they use it for a competitive advantage,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “I think you bring a sophistication to this discussion that we just need.” 

Wright signaled that Cassidy is in lockstep with the Trump administration on these issues, especially when presenting his  Foreign Pollution Fee Act  . 

“Thank you for the great dialogue we had about all these issues—about energy, about bettering lives, about trade practices, about prosperity for Americans,” s  aid DOE Secretary nominee Wright.  “I think yourself, and I, and President-elect Trump are very aligned on all those. And I think you have a creative idea about how do we address some of these asymmetries that have developed.” 

Background 

Last month, Cassidy and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)  released  a new discussion draft of their Foreign Pollution Fee Act to level the playing field with Chinese manufacturing and expand American production for public comment. In addition, the Steel Manufacturers Association, which represents 70 percent of the nation’s steel production,  called  on President-elect Trump and Congress to institute a foreign pollution fee. 

The Foreign Pollution Fee Act was a key topic at Cassidy’s  Louisiana Energy Security Summit  . The summit featured ten panels that explored protecting U.S. interests from unfair trade practices, Louisiana’s low-emission manufacturing advantage, and the role of natural gas in strengthening U.S. geopolitical influence. Panelists included presidents and CEOs from Entergy, First Solar, Buzzi UnicemUSA, Orsted, and Aluminum Technologies, former Trump administration officials, and leaders from Louisiana trade associations and major energy and Fortune 500 companies. 

In September, he released the  3  rd  episode of Bill on the Hill  , where he highlights his Foreign Pollution Fee Act and discusses China’s growing economy and military coming at the expense of the American worker. After hearing fellow Americans share their concerns, Cassidy presented his plan to address the nexus between economic development, national security, and the environment. His Foreign Pollution Fee Act would even the playing field while holding China accountable. 

He penned editorials in  Foreign Affairs  ,  The Washington Times  , and jointly in the  USA Today Network  discussing the geopolitical threat that China poses to U.S. global standing. Cassidy also joined Greta Van Susteren on Newsmax  to discuss  his foreign pollution fee, noting the competitive advantage China receives from intentionally ignoring environmental standards. 

In 2023, the Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives unanimously adopted a resolution urging Congress to pursue an industrial manufacturing and trade policy to counter competition from China.  Learn more here  . 

In 2022, Cassidy released a  landmark energy policy outline  in response to the Biden-Harris administration’s assault on domestic energy. The outline details how we can successfully reset U.S. energy policy, including Cassidy’s plan for an  Energy Operation Warp Speed  to cut permitting red tape and unleash domestic energy and manufacturing. Cassidy led Republican colleagues in  opposition to a domestic carbon tax  and introduced the  first comprehensive judicial reform for permitting bill  . He also pushed back on disastrous proposals from the Biden administration to limit development in the Outer Continental Shelf with the introduction of the  WHALE Act  and the  Offshore Energy Security Act of 2023  .

11:09:26 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:09:26 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Katie Britt (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Todd Young (R-IN), and John Cornyn (R-TX) called on the Biden administration to stop rushing trade negotiations behind closed doors. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is attempting to change at least three major trade agreements in secret, while sacrificing valuable leverage that USTR could use to win concessions from trading partners that would benefit Americans. 

USTR is seeking changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) by the end of the presidential term. If signed, the negotiated changes would be legally binding and could not easily be reversed without entering into additional trade negotiations. 

“Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation. USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies,”  wrote the senators. 

The senators warned that making concessions to trading partners would sacrifice leverage to make progress on a number of U.S. priorities. In USMCA negotiations, for example, USTR should use any available leverage to address Mexico’s illegal fishing practices and energy laws that favor Mexican fossil fuels over American energy, as well as Canada’s unfair dairy policies and taxes on digital services. USTR should also push to resolve the United States’ many outstanding concerns with Colombia, including labor standards and workers’ rights, corn and dairy market access, and auto regulations. 

“Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred,”  continued the senators. 

Read the full letter  here  or below: 

Dear President Biden: 

We write to express significant concerns with the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) lack of transparency and consultation regarding its efforts to negotiate binding interpretations of congressionally approved trade agreements. Trade policy works best for all Americans when all Americans—and their elected representatives in Congress—have a say in its development. We urge your administration to engage in meaningful and comprehensive consultations with Congress and stakeholders prior to moving forward on these negotiations with foreign trading partners. We also strongly urge USTR to push for the resolution of offensive trade concerns that are in the U.S. interest as part of any negotiations. 

As has been reported, USTR is seeking binding interpretations of certain investment obligations in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. These interpretations would govern the legal rights of stakeholders under the agreements and specify how disputes should be adjudicated. Given Congress’s constitutional authority over trade and the legally binding nature of these interpretations, it is critical that USTR meaningfully consult with Congress and stakeholders in a timely manner, prior to and during any efforts to negotiate legal text with trading partners. 

Unfortunately, USTR is pursuing substantive changes to congressionally approved trade agreements on an abbreviated timeline, out of the view of the public, and without meaningful congressional consultation. USTR did not consult with, or even notify, Congress before drafting these interpretations and seeking approval by the Executive Branch agencies. Member offices’ access to the text has been limited because of USTR’s confidentiality designations for trade documents, which have been unclear, inconsistent, and potentially inappropriate. The agency has failed to establish a process for taking or considering Member feedback, and it does not seem that USTR has consulted with the U.S. stakeholders who would be directly affected by these actions. Despite these concerns, USTR has since shared text with trading partners and is forging ahead with multiple initiatives in this space. Without adequately consulting on the USMCA text, USTR has moved forward with new text under the Colombia trade agreement, and we have recently heard that USTR may be seeking to propose similar text with respect to the Dominican RepublicCentral America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). 

Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders are critical to ensuring that affected companies and their workers understand what is being proposed and how it may impact operations at home and abroad. Additionally, proper consultations would help ensure that USTR considers the broader context in which any of these negotiations would be undertaken. Given that USTR’s proposed interpretations would have the most significant impact on U.S. companies, which have brought the most investment-related claims under these agreements, our trading partners may view these proposed interpretations as a benefit to them. We question why USTR has not attempted to leverage this dynamic to secure wins for the United States on our offensive trade issues with the countries in question. For example, USTR should use any available leverage in USMCA conversations to address Mexico’s illegal fishing practices and discriminatory energy measures, as well as Canada’s unfair dairy policies and digital services taxes. Similarly, with respect to Colombia, the United States has a litany of outstanding trade concerns, including labor standards and worker rights, dairy and corn market access, and auto regulations. Robust consultations with Congress and stakeholders would help USTR ensure that its engagements help Americans get what they were promised under U.S. trade agreements. 

To put it simply, trade policy is too important to keep Americans in the dark. We urge you to direct USTR to refrain from further negotiating text proposals with foreign trading partners unless and until meaningful consultations with Congress and stakeholders have occurred. To be clear, that has not happened. 

We thank you for your attention to this important matter.

11:09:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today released a list of top accomplishments in 2024 including the passage of the  Social Security Fairness Act  to repeal Windfall Elimination Program (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO), his  bill to provide tax relief  for Americans impacted by Hurricanes Francine and Ida, and the  Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Prevention Act  to curb high rate of stillbirths and maternal mortality. Additionally, Cassidy secured over $2.8 billion dollars from the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  and continued to  call for reform  to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) with his  new report  outlining the crisis  the program faces. Cassidy’s office also completed 1,162 constituent casework requests in 2024, bringing the total number of completed cases to 6,778 since 2021. 

“Louisianans sent me to Washington to deliver real solutions. In 2024, I did,”  said Dr. Cassidy.  “There were major wins across the board, including repealing WEP and GPO and securing $1.35 billion for broadband internet. I look forward to building on this momentum in 2025.” 

As the lead Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Cassidy passed legislation to  enhance research  into childhood cancer,  address hazing  incidents on college campuses, ensure students  receive financial aid packages on time  to choose the best, affordable college option for them,  improve children’s access  to emergency medical services, reform federal programs to better address  Alzheimer’s  and  autism  , and  promote access  to health care in rural areas. He also passed legislation through the HELP Committee to  strengthen services  for American seniors,  ensure health care workers  can access mental health and substance use care, and  increase support  for Americans caring for family members with disabilities or other challenging medical conditions. 

Additionally, as a result of Cassidy’s oversight on the HELP Committee,  up to $375 million  of taxpayer funds were prevented from going to dead people as part of Democrats’ 2021 pension bailout. Cassidy also prevented the Biden-Harris administration from  closing a Medicare call center  in Bogalusa, LA, saving 650 Louisiana jobs. 

Cassidy joined the entire Louisiana delegation in passing  legislation  designating the Rayville, Louisiana U.S. Post Office as the “Luke Letlow Post Office Building” and  legislation  to include Lafourche Parish within the boundary of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area.

11:09:34 root         DEBUG    Titles: Chairman Wicker, SASC Republicans Demand Accountability After Inspector General Report on Secretary Austin
11:09:34 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:09:34 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led 11 of his SASC Republican colleagues on a letter to President Biden. The letter demands accountability for the Pentagon response to an Inspector General  report  on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s chain of command failures during his hospitalizations in 2023 and 2024. 

In the letter, the senators note that in two separate instances Secretary of Defense Austin’s failure to secure his chain of command and inform Congress could have led to a national security catastrophe. 

“  For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress or in your administration knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary...At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan,”  the senators wrote.  “The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football...It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation.” 

The senators add that accountability for Secretary Austin is long overdue. 

"There must be accountability for Secretary Austin’s irresponsible behavior, your administration’s multiple violations of the FVRA, and the mishandling of the nuclear football. Certainly, if a uniformed officer had done only one of these things he or she would be facing the end of their career. Sadly, those in charge seem to believe that the same standards do not apply to them. The American people will no longer accept a lack of accountability for the failures of our senior military leaders, whether civilian or uniformed,"  the senators wrote. 

In January 2024, Senator Wicker  led  11 of his SASC Republican colleagues on a letter addressed to Secretary Austin, posing many questions about his incapacitation that would only be addressed in the Inspector General report more than a year later. 

Senators Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., Ted Budd, R-N.C., Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., joined Chairman Wicker on the letter.

President Joseph R. Biden 

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 

Washington, DC 20500? 

Dear Mr. President, 

Yesterday the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DOD OIG) released its report on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s multi-day absence in December 2023, and January 2024 based on his medical incapacitation. The report found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks failed to notify Congress, the White House, the Comptroller General, and key officials within the Department of Defense that Secretary Austin was incapacitated. The report confirmed what we already knew – these failures to notify were clear violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), a law that is rooted in the Constitutional principle that the people control their government. Alarmingly, the OIG report not only found that Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary Hicks violated the FVRA in December 2023 and January 2024, but they also violated it on two occasions in June 2024. These two additional violations were wholly unknown to Congress and demonstrate an utter disregard for oversight and accountability that should be completely unacceptable in the Department of Defense. 

For days in December, January, and June, no one in Congress knew that Secretary Austin was unable to perform the functions and duties of the Secretary, or that Deputy Secretary Hicks was the acting Secretary. In fact, for several days in December and January, not even Deputy Secretary Hicks knew that she was the acting Secretary. Once she found out, she, too, failed to notify Congress and the White House as required by law. At the time of these absences, your administration was still reeling from a Chinese intelligence and reconnaissance balloon sailing across the United States, Putin continued his violent and illegal war on Ukraine all the while rattling the nuclear saber, and violent Islamic terrorists and other Iran-backed extremists were ramping up for an historic assault on Israel, emboldened by your disastrous abandonment of Afghanistan. The world was far from stable, and America was not safe. What makes this situation so much worse, however, is that the moment Secretary Austin’s office became vacant, no one had control of the nuclear football, and the entire American nuclear enterprise was left idling. 

It is incredibly fortunate that no major national security crisis occurred while Secretary Austin was incapacitated, however, the OIG report itself recognizes that if a crisis had occurred in that time frame, the outcome could have been disastrous for our nation. ?While we applaud the OIG for its thorough and objective report, it is clear that political officers within the DOD obstructed and delayed the OIG’s work until it had no choice but to release the report five days before you and Secretary Austin are to leave office. 

There must be accountability for Secretary Austin’s irresponsible behavior, your administration’s multiple violations of the FVRA, and the mishandling of the nuclear football. Certainly, if a uniformed officer had done only one of these things he or she would be facing the end of their career. Sadly, those in charge seem to believe that the same standards do not apply to them. The American people will no longer accept a lack of accountability for the failures of our senior military leaders, whether civilian or uniformed. 

In your last week in office, you must do the right thing and hold Secretary Austin accountable for his multiple failures to comply with the law and notify Congress of vacancies in his office. ? 

Sincerely,

During his remarks, Senator Wicker highlighted the need for federal government engagement in establishing a wastewater system in DeSoto County to accommodate the area’s exploding population growth. Former Representative Lee Zeldin committed to working with the regional utility authority to resolve this problem. 

Additionally, Senator Wicker highlighted the collaborative effort needed between the EPA and the local sponsor of the Pearl River Basin Flood Control Project to find adequate solutions to the flooding in Jackson. 

“Former Representative Lee Zeldin will bring much-needed changes to the EPA. I look forward to working with him through my position on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to reverse harmful Biden administration rulemaking and protect our nation’s environment,”  Senator Wicker said.

During his remarks, Senator Wicker highlighted the return of Amtrak services to Mississippi. Once operational, the passenger service lines will reconnect the Gulf Coast to the region and provide an alternative way to move people safely, which could also reduce traffic on the roadways. Senator Wicker invited Former Representative Sean Duffy to visit Mississippi in June of this year, when Amtrak services are expected to resume along the Gulf Coast. Senator Wicker also highlighted the significance of the Essential Air Service. The program ensures that rural Mississippians continue to have access to commercial air service that is key to continued economic success. 

“Today’s confirmation hearing reaffirms what we already know: Former Representative Sean Duffy will be an excellent Secretary of Transportation. Our mutual interest in upgrading roads and bridges and finalizing Gulf Coast rail will benefit Mississippi and the nation,”  Senator Wicker said  . “I am confident that he will bring positive change to the Department of Transportation, and I look forward to working with him through my position on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.”

Each delegate will also receive a $10,000 college scholarship for undergraduate study. 

“I congratulate Shayleen and Jackson for being selected to be part of this competitive program,”  Senator Wicker said.  “They deserve this opportunity. Both students have demonstrated commitment to community service, extracurricular activities, and their studies. I have no doubt they will represent our state well.” 

“I offer my most sincere congratulations to Shayleen and Jackson for being selected to represent Mississippi as part of this prestigious program. Their hard work, dedication to academics, student government involvement, and community service have truly set them apart. I am confident they will represent our state with distinction, and I look forward to meeting them,”  Senator Hyde-Smith said. 

Moeini, a St. Patrick Catholic High School senior, serves as the president of the National Honor Society and vice president of Student Council. She plans to study biology and policy at Columbia University. 

Pearce, a Gulfport High School senior, serves as a representative on the Mississippi Department of Education Student Advisory Council and president of Youth Legislature and Model UN. He plans to double major in aerospace engineering and public policy at the University of Alabama or major in public policy at Yale University. 

Alternates to the 2025 program are Braden Overby of Mendenhall who attends Simpson County Academy and Lindan Garner of Madison, a student at Jackson Preparatory School. 

The Mississippi State Department of Education selected the Mississippi delegates and alternates from students nominated by teachers and principals. The chief state school officer for each jurisdiction confirms the final selection. 

The USSYP was created by Senate Resolution 324 in 1962. It has been fully funded by The Hearst Foundations since its inception. No government funds are used.

11:09:39 root         DEBUG    Titles: Chairman Wicker Leads Senate Armed Services Committee in Pete Hegseth's Secretary of Defense Nomination Hearing
11:09:39 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:09:39 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today led his committee colleagues in a hearing examining the nomination of Mr. Peter B. Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s nominee to serve as the next Secretary of Defense. 

In his opening remarks, Chairman Wicker reviewed the extremely precarious global situation that will face President-elect Trump and his team. The Chairman suggested that the Pentagon will need strong leadership to confront growing threats from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and others. 

“The United States faces the most dangerous security environment since World War II. We are witnessing the explosive growth and reach of China’s hard power. We are also observing the emergence of an Axis of Aggressors,”  Chairman Wicker said.  “Terrorism remains a threat as Israel wages war against Hamas and Hezbollah and as the Assad regime collapses in Syria. America has entered a window of maximum danger, and the department needs energetic and focused civilian leadership. Those values begin at the top, with the Secretary of Defense.” 

Chairman Wicker also applauded Hegseth as a prospective change agent at the Department of Defense for President Trump, after years of sclerotic, bureaucratic rule within the Department. 

“Every day, men and women in uniform make tremendous contributions to U.S. security. They and the American people deserve a Pentagon that does the same,”  Chairman Wicker said.  “Today’s Department of Defense is no longer prepared for great power competition. It is not a national defense institution ready to achieve and sustain technological supremacy across the range of operations. As I said in the hearing, Pete Hegseth is an unconventional pick, just like Donald Trump was an unconventional candidate when he walked down those escalator steps in 2015. We need rapid change at scale in our Department of Defense, and Pete Hegseth has the determination and the tools to achieve real change. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.” 

In his exchange with the nominee, Chairman Wicker asked Mr. Hegseth for an accounting of the variety of allegations leveled against him relating to his personal conduct. Hegseth addressed the question by highlighting the anonymous nature of the allegations and focused on his priorities for bringing the Pentagon back to its duties of warfighting. 

Chairman Wicker additionally asked Mr. Hegseth to expand on his views on a range of national security issues, to include defense budgeting, the threat of China, and reforms required at the Department of Defense. Hegseth agreed that the defense budget cannot be permitted to remain under 3 percent of gross domestic product, and vocally endorsed Senator Wicker’s recent FORGED Act to reform DoD. 

“Senator, I’ve had a chance to review the FORGED Act, that paper. Those are precisely the kinds of ideas that need to be pursued, and I look forward to working with this committee to ensure we cut the red tape, we incentivize innovation, we rebuild the defense industrial base, cut out the bureaucracy, all the things that are preventing the platforms and the tools from getting rapidly from our great defense companies here that should and those that want to compete into the hands of warfighters…I would present to the committee the reputation of President Donald Trump and me coming alongside him to ensure we have peace through strength by rebuilding our military, investing as necessary. Going under 3 percent, Mr. Chairman, is very dangerous,”  Hegseth said. 

Watch the full exchange  here  . 

Read the remarks as delivered below or watch them  here  . 

If confirmed, Mr. Pete Hegseth would assume the role in a moment of consequence. The United States faces the most dangerous security environment since World War II. We are witnessing the explosive growth and reach of China’s hard power. We are also observing the emergence of an Axis of Aggressors. That coalition is characterized by broadening and deepening military cooperation among the dictatorships ruling China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Terrorism remains a threat as Israel wages war against Hamas and Hezbollah and as the Assad regime collapses in Syria. America has entered a window of maximum danger, and the department needs energetic and focused civilian leadership. Those values begin at the top, with the Secretary of Defense. 

Many of my distinguished colleagues have served in a significant tenure on this committee, and our [memories] are fairly long. We should reflect over previous Secretaries of Defense and their hearings and ask ourselves a simple question. Has the  civilian  leadership of the Pentagon – under administration of both parties – proven up to the challenge? Often the answer has been no, the civilian leadership has not built the Department of Defense to meet the moment. And this is our moment to correct that. A few examples illustrate how leaders in the past have fallen short. 

Most of the department’s signature programs run years behind schedule and billions of dollars over cost. Vital initiatives have suffered, such as the F-35, the new Sentinel ICBM, and the Navy’s shipbuilding program, including the Constellation-class Frigate. 

The Department of Defense desperately needs civilian leaders who listen to the advice of combatant commanders – many of whom would benefit from innovative systems. Yet a risk-averse DOD culture has kept too many promising technologies on the wrong side of the so-called Valley of Death – that tenuous period between experimental prototypes and production contracts. Defense companies backed by venture capital receive less than one percent of defense contracts. 

As we all know, the Pentagon still cannot even pass an audit. The department must simplify and streamline its bureaucracy so it can respond to innovation. Staffs have ballooned. Organizations are top-heavy. Civilian leaders have promised time-and-again to slim down the bureaucracy and perhaps genuinely hoped to. 

Every day, men and women in uniform make tremendous contributions to U.S. security. They and the American people deserve a Pentagon that does the same. Today’s Department of Defense is no longer prepared for great power competition. It is not a national defense institution ready to achieve and sustain technological supremacy across the range of operations. 

Admittedly, this nomination is unconventional. The nominee is unconventional, just like that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president. That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth an excellent choice to improve this unacceptable status quo that I just described. He is a decorated post-9/11 combat veteran. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down. Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the warfighter and the military’s core missions – deterring wars and winning the ones we must fight. He will bring a swift end to corrosive distractions such as DEI. Today, many simply acknowledge and live with the systemic problems I have mentioned earlier – in acquisition, accountability, technology transition, and organizational [and] civil service reform. Mr. Hegseth will actually move to fix these issues decisively. In short, I am confident that Mr. Hegseth – supported by a team of experienced top officials – will get the job done. 

The Secretary of Defense is an incredibly important position, but the secretary’s span of control is limited. The Pentagon is vast, with 3 million-plus personnel – uniformed, civilian, and contractor. A successful secretary understands that steering the ship means focusing his attention on strategic-level priorities. The secretary must be supported with exceptional subordinates who will run the day-to-day affairs of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Services, and the other DOD Components. 

I am also confident that as an Infantryman, Mr. Hegseth understands the military principal of Commander’s Intent: Communicate the clear objective, empower subordinates to use initiative and judgment, and hold everybody accountable. 

We must not underestimate the importance of having a top-shelf communicator as secretary of defense. Other than the president, no official plays a larger role in telling the men and women in uniform, the Congress, and the public about the threats we face and the need for a “Peace Through Strength” defense policy. I have no doubt Mr. Hegseth will excel in a skill in which many of his predecessors have fallen short. 

Much has been made of both Mr. Hegseth’s personal life and some of his policy pronouncements. Regarding his personal conduct, Mr. Hegseth has admitted to falling short, as we all do from time to time. It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the accusations levelled at Mr. Hegseth have come from anonymous sources. Contrast these anonymous accusations with the many public letters of support and commendation. We have seen letters from people who served with Mr. Hegseth. These individuals have worked with him professionally. They really know him and his character. These patriotic Americans have been willing to put their names and reputations on the line to support Mr. Hegseth. 

I look forward to sharing these testimonials with the American people. Let me mention one right now. It comes from David Bellavia, who earned the medal of honor for heroic actions in combat in Fallujah, Iraq. David Bellavia writes the following. “Pete is fearless, unflappable, and confronts conflicts head on. He is a leader to the core. When Pete is confirmed as the next Secretary of Defense of the United States of America, this country will finally know the privilege of having a true ambassador, able to speak on behalf of this generation and its two-decade Global War on Terror....Washington doesn’t build men like Pete. Combat builds men like Pete.” 

As I said, there are more letters expressing the same endorsement. Today, we will hear from the nominee directly. I want to thank Mr. Hegseth, as well as his loved ones, for being here today. I look forward to discussing his nomination. And I look forward to hearing from Mr. Hegseth about the ways he hopes to rebuild the American strength that secures the peace. 

And so now I turn to my friend and colleague, Ranking Member Reed, for his opening remarks.

11:09:41 root         DEBUG    Titles: Pfluger, Cruz Introduce Bill to Strike Down Biden Natural Gas Tax and Alleviate Burden on Hardworking Texans
11:09:41 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:09:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  — Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced legislation to alleviate a tax burden President Biden put on hardworking Texans and Americans across the country. The  Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act  will strike the natural gas tax imposed by President Biden in the Inflation 'Expansion' Act, and will ultimately lower costs for customers. 

“President Biden has spent the past four years pandering to progressive climate activists — pushing legislation that has crippled the American energy industry. The President’s harmful natural gas tax has driven up the cost of household energy bills and has made inflation even worse for hardworking Americans,”  said Congressman Pfluger.  “I am proud to work with Senator Cruz to stand up for the Permian Basin by reintroducing the Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act to strike the President’s tax on natural gas. 

“Joe Biden's administration has prioritized an extreme climate agenda over the needs of Americans. Their policies have driven inflation, risked jobs, and hurt energy security. The methane fee in the Inflation Reduction Act harms Texas producers in the Permian Basin. Under President Trump, this policy will be reversed. I am leading the fight in the Senate to restore energy independence, protect jobs, and prioritize America,”  said Senator Cruz. 

As reported in E&E News  ,  “  Guthrie has said  repealing the methane fee  is one of his top IRA targets, along with the climate law’s electric vehicle tax credits.  ” 

Text of this legislation is available  here  . 

Rep. Pfluger's bill is supported by several American Energy Groups who applauded his leadership on this legislation including, Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA), American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, U.S. Oil & Gas Association (USOGA), American Petroleum Institute (API), and National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA). 

Ben Shepperd, President, Permian Basin Petroleum Association said,  “  It is a new day in Washington but thankfully, Congressman Pfluger returns to fight for the American people and the people of the Permian Basin. Worldwide demand for natural gas continues to grow and American natural gas helps meet the needs of people around the world. This Act will help ensure that sensible energy policies prevail for the benefit of all.” 

Anne Bradbury, President & CEO, American Exploration & Production Council said,  “The punitive natural gas tax is counterproductive as it threatens higher energy prices for American families and businesses, and it ignores the work of American energy companies to reduce methane intensity and overall emissions from their operations. Congressman Pfluger's reintroduction of the Natural Gas Repeal Act is an important step toward ensuring energy affordability and reliability for the American people, and ensuring that American energy production remains competitive on the global stage.” 

Greg Sindelar, CEO, Texas Public Policy Foundation said,  “Taxing methane emissions is an expensive form of virtue-signaling that does nothing but harm U.S. energy production while outsourcing emissions to countries with far worse environmental standards. We commend Rep. Pfluger and Sen. Cruz for standing up for American energy and working to lower costs for families by repealing this misguided tax.” 

Karr Ingham, Economist, President, Texas Alliance of Energy Producers said,  “The methane fee is an ill-conceived tax on the production and delivery of petroleum energy to the American people and customers of U.S. domestic energy around the world. It punishes the U.S. domestic oil and gas industry in Texas and beyond. It will put Texas companies out of business, and result in the shuttering of thousands of wells in the state. The Texas Alliance of Energy Producers enthusiastically supports its repeal, and we applaud and appreciate Congressman Pfluger for his efforts to eliminate this damaging and onerous tax on American energy and oil and gas producers in Texas.” 

Tim Stewart, President, US Oil & Gas Association said,  “Over the past four years, the Biden Administration created the most hostile regulatory and legislative climate for the oil and gas industry in our 160-year history. They capped their legacy with a poorly designed natural gas tax on small US oil and gas producers – which is really a tax on US consumers. This tax needs to be repealed as quickly as possible before American households really begin to feel its pinch. We applaud the Congressman for acting so quickly to protect the pocketbooks of moderate and low-income families. We look forward to working with him to get this legislation quickly passed.” 

Amanda Eversole, API Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer said,  “American voters sent a clear message in support of affordable, reliable energy, and now it’s time to deliver by repealing misguided policies like the natural gas tax. We thank Rep. Pfluger for his leadership and look forward to working with the incoming administration and Congress to advance a pro-consumer regulatory approach that balances the need to reduce emissions with meeting growing energy demand.” 

Erik Milito, President, National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) said,  “Congressman Pfluger’s Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act will play a critical role in counteracting the inflationary impacts created by the previous administration, which have disproportionately affected lower-income Americans. This legislation will reduce Americans’ energy costs and strengthen our domestic energy sector, providing much-needed economic relief to families nationwide.”

11:09:43 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, DC  — Today, Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11) voted to pass legislation that will protect female athletes in Texas and across America. The  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025  will prevent biological men from competing in women's sports by reinforcing Title IX protections and defining standards for athletic competition by a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth. 

In his speech on the House floor in support of this legislation, Congressman Pfluger said in part,  "Female athletes should never be subject to compete against biological men in sports, plain and simple. Allowing biological men to compete in female sports is not only a complete and utter failure to women who have trained their whole lives to achieve their dreams, but it also completely ignores the scientific fact that men and women have clear biological differences that make competing on the same sports team unfair and dangerous... As a father of three girls who play sports, this issue is very personal to me. I desire to see my daughters succeed in their sports, to feel safe in their locker rooms and bathrooms, and to be protected by their educational institutions. That is why we must pass this legislation today."   
  
Watch Congressman Pfluger's full remarks on the House floor in support of this legislation  here  or read them as delivered below. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 28, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. 

Female athletes should never be subject to compete against biological men in sports, plain and simple. Allowing biological men to compete in female sports is not only a complete and utter failure to women who have trained their whole lives to achieve their dreams, but it also completely ignores the scientific fact that men and women have clear biological differences that make competing on the same sports team unfair and dangerous. 

Mr. Speaker, just last year, the Biden administration tried to push a radical Title IX change that would have prevented any institution receiving federal funding from banning biological men from competing in women’s sports. That is insane. Educational institutions have a responsibility to protect the women and girls that attend them, and this legislation ensures that they will be able to do just that. 

Let me be clear, allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports hurts women. It takes away opportunities, scholarship funds, and titles that are meant for women. It takes away a woman’s right to feel safe and comfortable in her locker room. As a father of three girls who play sports, this issue is very personal to me. I desire to see my daughters succeed in their sports, to feel safe in their locker rooms and bathrooms, and to be protected by their educational institutions. That is why we must pass this legislation today. 

The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports will prevent schools from allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports by defining sex in an athletic competition by genetics at birth. I thank the gentlemen and my good friend from Florida, Mr. Stuebe, for leading this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 

I yield back.

11:09:46 root         DEBUG    Titles: Hageman Reintroduces Legislation to Slow the Administrative State
11:09:46 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:09:46 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Congresswoman Harriet Hageman reintroduced the Regulatory Cooling Off Act, which amends the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to slow the regulatory onslaught perpetrated against the American people by federal bureaucrats. By slowing down the rulemaking timeline, increasing transparency, and streamlining judicial relief, this bill aims to empower the American people rather than unelected officials. 

“Since its passage in 1946, Congress has failed to substantially amend the APA, while also giving administrative agencies more power and resources,” Congresswoman Hageman said. “This dynamic has created the administrative state we see today, one which can impose trillions in new regulatory costs without any congressional oversight. While there have been some recent victories, such as the overturning of  Chevron  deference, the American people will only see real relief if Congress acts and reclaims its authority as the people’s representatives. The Regulatory Cooling Off Act takes this first step by slowing the administrative state and making it more accountable to the public, which opens our governing system for Congress to once again claim the mantle as the main drivers of national policy.” 

Background: 

The APA establishes how the agencies make rules, adjudicate administrative litigation, and provide for judicial review. Because of quick timelines and unspecified constraints, the executive branch can quickly develop and enforce rules, even if it lacks authorization from Congress. President Biden imposed over $1.7 trillion in new federal regulatory costs, increasing the annual cost to comply with federal regulation to at least $2.117 trillion, which comes out to $15,788 annually per household. 

The Regulatory Cooling Off Act slows the regulatory process itself by requiring the agencies to wait six months before enforcing any new regulations it develops. It extends timelines for public participation, forces the agencies to transparently provide all information the public needs to meaningfully engage with their government, and provides Americans challenging federal regulation with forum relief from activist courts that have historically backed the administrative state.

11:09:47 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-15
11:09:47 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Harriet Hageman introduced the Seventh Amendment Restoration Act which is designed to secure Americans’ right to a jury trial as protection against federal agency use of administrative law courts (ALCs). Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) use of ALCs violated a defendant’s right to a jury trial, and Rep. Hageman’s legislation would further solidify this decision by requiring its government-wide applicability in response to the Biden-Harris Administration arguing otherwise. 

“I spent decades in private practice representing Wyoming citizens and businesses against federal agencies who use their own internal courts to target the regulated community. Our Constitutional Republic is underpinned by the separation of powers, so no unit of government is law maker, judge, jury, and executioner. The modern executive branch, however, has found a way to create the law, enforce it, and then prosecute alleged violators before their ALCs. The right to a jury trial is so important that our Founders enumerated it as a grievance in the Declaration of Independence and then secured that right in the Seventh Amendment. Paired together, my legislation and the Supreme Court’s ruling would secure this fundamental right across all federal agencies, thereby minimizing the threat of the modern administrative state,” stated Rep. Hageman.   
  
“Rep. Hageman's Seventh Amendment Restoration Act would throw a lifeline to Americans stuck in the swamp of the agency court system. Her legislation represents a critical return to proper separation of powers by restoring the Article III branch's constitutional role and helping individuals reclaim their right to fair proceedings in an impartial court," said  Stewart Whitson  (link is external)  , Senior Director of Federal Affairs for the Foundation for Government Accountability. 

Background: 

The Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees a jury trial in civil cases in federal court. In 1946, Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act, creating the rulemaking process we know today and ALCs within the agencies to adjudicate disputes arising from alleged violations of agency created law. However, ALCs do not adhere to the same due process rules as Article III courts, and agencies have overwhelming success against Americans when adjudicating disputes before judges they hire and pay. Thirty-four federal departments and agencies have ALCs, but last year in  SEC v. Jarkesy  , the Supreme Court held that the SEC’s use of ALCs violated jury trial rights. Since this ruling, the Biden-Harris Administration has tried to chip away at the relief the Court provided by attempting to narrow its scope to just the SEC. Rep. Hageman’s legislation would rebuke this effort and confirm what every rational American knows—that our rights secured in the Constitution are absolute.

11:09:48 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:09:48 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC  – The Biden administration’s effort to fundamentally rewrite the very meaning and purpose of Title IX would threaten the integrity and safety of women’s sports nationwide by allowing men and boys to compete alongside women and girls. These actions have undermined decades of progress and robbed female athletes of fair competition and opportunity. From high school gymnasiums to collegiate arenas, anti-women policies endanger players and jeopardize hard-earned championship prospects. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Greg Steube (FL-17) and cosponsored by Congresswoman Hageman, will restore fairness to female athletics by establishing commonsense definitions for sports eligibility and deny federal funding to any organizations that violate these standards. 

Congresswoman Harriet Hageman voiced her support for this bill: “As one of the first generations to benefit from Title IX, I want all girls to have the same opportunity to safely participate in athletics. The ideological war on womanhood completely disregards biological facts, putting our daughters in danger on courts, fields, and tracks. This isn’t progress—it’s insanity. The left’s anti-woman agenda is a slap in the face to every female who has trained, sacrificed, and excelled in their sport and the generations who fought to give them that opportunity. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act is a commonsense solution to ensure fairness, safety, and respect for biological realities. Republicans will not back down in this fight to protect our daughters and their futures.” 

Background  : 

The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 establishes clear definitions for sports participation based on biological sex at birth. It prohibits federal funding for schools or athletic programs that allow biological males to compete in female categories. With Republican majorities in Congress and support from President Trump, this legislation is poised to defend the rights of women and girls across the nation.

11:09:50 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  –Representative John James (MI-10) has been selected to serve on the following three subcommittees on the House Energy and Commerce Committee for the 119  th  Congress: 

· Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade (CMT) 

· Energy 

· Health 

Last year, Rep. James was the first freshman selected to the Energy and Commerce Committee since 2011. With a background in the auto-supply chain industry, Rep. James is focused on ending harmful electric vehicle mandates that have already cost thousands of jobs in Michigan, regaining American energy independence, reshoring our manufacturing base, and bringing down healthcare costs. 

Rep. James issues the following statement regarding his subcommittee assignments: 

“I am beyond thrilled to continue serving Southeast Michigan on three subcommittees this Congress including the subcommittees on Energy, Health, and Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. Each one has direct jurisdiction over important issues that impacts Michiganders. On these subcommittees, I am excited for the opportunity to work with the incoming Trump Administration to pass legislation that will lower energy prices, increase transparency in the health care sector, and re-shore Michigan’s manufacturing jobs. 

“In November, you gave me my marching orders: help bring our jobs back from Mexico and China, restore American energy dominance, and fight the nameless, faceless, ghouls in big government, big tech and big ‘health’ that are bankrupting, hurting and killing Americans by the millions. Time to get to work.”

11:09:52 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Congressman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) — chairman emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — released the following statement on the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold legislation in McCaul’s 21  st  Century Peace Through Strength Act, which forced Bytedance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. 

“Under Bytedance’s ownership, TikTok is a modern-day Trojan Horse of the Chinese Communist Party, which uses the app to manipulate mass audiences, surveil their activity, and weaponize their personal data. We’ve seen the CCP wield this type of data against its own people to spy on, interrogate, and even imprison political opponents and minority groups. It sends shivers down my spine to think of how they intend to use similar data against America’s youth. 

“The Supreme Court’s decision — which both upholds Congress’ intent and protects U.S. national security — couldn’t come at a more crucial time. President Biden’s appeasement strategy toward China has left Americans more vulnerable than ever to the threat of the CCP. I look forward to the Trump administration once again putting our nation first and urge them to start by closing the CCP’s back-door access to Americans’ personal devices.” 

Rep. McCaul has been sounding the alarm about the threat from TikTok  since 2019  (link is external)  . McCaul’s 21st Century Peace Through Strength Act contained a provision authored by former Rep. Gallagher to force Bytedance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. As stated in the bill, if Bytedance sells TikTok to a company based in the U.S. or any non-adversarial country, TikTok could continue to operate in the United States.

“The Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous open-border policies have wreaked havoc on our communities, cost thousands of young Americans’ lives, and left our nation vulnerable to rising terrorism. Thankfully, with Republicans in control of the House, Senate, and White House, this committee has a unique opportunity to help turn the tide. As a former attorney tasked with securing the border and the former chairman of this committee, I know fixing the crisis at our border won’t be easy, but I look forward to working with Chairman Green and the Trump administration to help put a stop to the madness and keep Americans safe.” 

Committee Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-Tenn.) released the following statement on the committee's organization for the 119th Congress: 

“As the Committee organizes for the 119th Congress, we are prepared to ensure the Department of Homeland Security succeeds in its no-fail mission and fulfills the mandate given by the American people to restore public safety. It is an honor to return as chairman, and I remain committed to finding opportunities for bipartisan solutions alongside Ranking Member Thompson. 

“I am grateful for the incredible work of our returning members and proudly welcome impressive new additions to our Committee roster. Representatives Ogles, Biggs, Evans, Mackenzie, and Knott will bring valuable insight and experience to the Homeland Security Committee. 

“Next week, the Committee will hit the ground running. We will fight to secure our borders, combat terrorism on U.S. soil, bolster our cyber defenses, promote our nation’s maritime security, and ensure the resiliency of our communities—all while restoring government accountability. 

“In the wake of numerous crises created by the Biden administration, these missions have never been more important. I look forward to working with this robust team and the incoming Trump administration to make America safe once again.”

They released the bill after the Biden administration  moved to rescind  (link is external)  Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. 

“Removing Cuba from the State Sponsor of Terrorism list will only embolden the country’s brutal communist regime as it seeks to destabilize the globe and undermine democracy. President Biden should know better. Under his watch, the Castro regime has brutally repressed and starved its own people, sent its citizens to help Putin’s army destroy Ukraine, and hosted a Beijing spy base, from which the CCP can surveil Americans and expand its malign influence,”  said Chairman Emeritus McCaul.  “I’m proud to join this legislation to reverse President Biden’s shameful appeasement strategy and put the Castro Regime — and the bad actors it supports around the world — back on notice.” 

“It is clear that with President Biden’s betrayal of the Cuban community on the island and in exile, the need to keep the regime on the State Sponsors of Terrorism List until freedom is restored is more necessary than ever,”  said Chairwoman Salazar.  “I am proud to reintroduce the FORCE Act to ensure no other President can unilaterally violate our nation’s established policies in such a grotesque manner.” 

Background: 

The FORCE Act prevents the president from removing Cuba from the State Sponsor of Terrorism List until they meet the requirements of Section 205 of the LIBERTAD Act (P.L. 104-114). Section 205 of the LIBERTAD Act requires Cuba to comply with the following conditions: 

  * Release all political prisoners and allow for investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate international human rights organizations. 
  * Transition away from the Castro regime to a system that guarantees the rights of the Cuban people to express themselves freely. 
  * Commit to holding free and fair elections.

“And perhaps most troubling, he once again touted his botched Afghanistan withdrawal as a victory — claiming it did not damage our alliances nor create a haven for terrorism.

11:09:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. --  On Wednesday, January 15, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved the  United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act,  legislation that aims to spur greater investment in manufacturing jobs in America – particularly when it comes to semiconductor and chip production – strengthen U.S. supply chains to reinforce the nation’s security, and combat China’s harmful influence. The legislation passed 423-1. 

Currently, Taiwan is the United States' largest partner without a tax treaty. 

"America should not have to rely on foreign adversaries like China for our supply chains when we can partner with better allies like Taiwan,"  Rep. Kelly said.  "As conflicts continue to rise across the globe, we must build our relationships with strong democracies, like Taiwan." 

BACKGROUND 

  * American workers and businesses will benefit from deepening the U.S. economic relationship with Taiwan. In 2019, U.S. exports to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs. 
  * Taiwanese investment directly supports nearly 21,000 jobs in the United States and $1.5 billion in U.S. exports. 
  * Establishing a tax treaty with Taiwan encourages U.S. based semiconductor and chip manufacturers to grow and invest here in the U.S., further securing strategic supply chains.

11:10:06 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. --  Today,  U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA)  announced he will serve as the Chairman of the Ways & Means Subcommittee on Tax in the 119th Congress. Kelly previously served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax in the 118th Congress. 

The announcement comes after the Ways & Means Committee convened for its official Organization Meeting on Tuesday. 

“As we begin the 119th Congress, I’m honored to once again chair the Ways & Means Tax Subcommittee,”  said Chairman Kelly.  “2025 will be the Super Bowl of Tax as we work to extend the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which spurred the greatest economy the United States has seen in generations. There is a lot of work ahead, and I’m ready to work with President Trump, Speaker Johnson, and Chairman Smith to fulfill the mandate set forth by the American people.” 

"The Ways and Means Committee is blessed with leaders that bring an unparalleled expertise and knowledge to the committee’s work,"  said Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO).  "Chairman Kelly’s leadership – including his integral role in developing and facilitating the work of our 10 Tax Teams over the past year – has put our Committee in a position to deliver on President Trump’s economic agenda and to extend and build upon the 2017 Trump tax cuts as swiftly as possible." 

In 2024, Rep. Kelly and Chairman Smith led the Committee's  Tax Teams  (link is external)  initiatives, a collection of 10 groups which addressed key tax provisions from the 2017 Trump tax cuts that are set to expire in 2025 and identified legislative solutions that will continue to help families, workers, and small businesses.

  * Subcommittee on Tax -- Chairman Mike Kelly (PA-16) 
  * Subcommittee on Health -- Chairman Vern Buchanan (FL-16)

11:10:07 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Senators Ted Budd (R-NC) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) have reintroduced the  Lumbee Fairness Act  , which would grant federal benefits to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. These are the same benefits that every other federally-recognized tribe receives. 

The House version of the bill is led by Rep. David Rouzer (R-NC) and Mark Harris (R-NC) and sponsored by Reps. Richard Hudson (R-NC), Valerie Foushee (D-NC), Addison McDowell (R-NC), Deborah Ross (D-NC), Greg Murphy (R-NC), Don Davis (D-NC), and Tim Moore (R-NC). 

Sen. Budd said in a statement: 

“More than 60,000 members of the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina have waited decades for federal recognition. They deserve the same rights and privileges granted to other Native American tribes across our country. This is a basic matter of fairness. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Tillis to finally get this bill passed and signed into law.” 

Sen. Tillis said: 

“I am dedicated to ensuring that Congress fulfills its six-decade-old promise to grant full federal recognition to the Lumbee people. We are now closer than ever to finally fulfilling that promise. There is clearly strong bipartisan support for this effort in Congress, and both President Biden and President-elect Trump firmly back recognition. This bill has passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support over the past three Congresses. I will continue to pursue all options to finally achieve full federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe.” 

Lumbee Tribal Chairman John Lowery said: 

“I am pleased to learn that the Lumbee Fairness Act has been reintroduced in both the United States Senate and House. I want to thank Senators Tillis and Budd and Representatives Rouzer and Harris for being the main sponsors of our bills in their respective houses and for leading the way as they work towards our full federal recognition.” 

Background  : 

The Lumbee Tribe is the largest American-Indian tribe in the Eastern United States. In 1885, North Carolina formally recognized the Lumbee Tribe. Three years later, the Tribe began to seek federal recognition. In 1956, Congress finally passed legislation recognizing the tribe, but the bill included an unfair caveat that denied the Lumbee benefits that every other federally-recognized tribe receives.

11:10:08 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:10:08 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Senators Ted Budd (R-NC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) have sent a letter to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf concerning “the continued presence of unauthorized electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and illicit vaping products among vendors at large trade shows across the country.” 

Read the text of the letter  : 

We remain concerned about the continued presence of unauthorized electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and illicit vaping products among vendors at large trade shows across the country. Vendors display and sell illicit products in the presence of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) personnel despite their lack of market authorization. These concerns were brought to the FDA’s attention on January 25, 2024 and again on June 6, 2024, but the FDA has not provided a satisfactory, substantive response. Meanwhile, manufacturers, mostly from China, continue to pour their illicit vapes into the United States with few, if any, consequences. For this reason, we urge you to utilize enforcement actions against illicit products at 2025 trade shows, namely events hosted by the Total Products Expo (TPE) and the Alternative Products Expo (APE), across the country at locations in Florida, Nevada, Tennessee, and Texas. 

As mentioned in a letter dated June 6, FDA personnel were present at the 2024 TPE in Las Vegas, Nevada and were distributing educational materials—in the presence of unauthorized vendors—and yet did not utilize enforcement actions. Simply staffing a booth alongside illicit products is negligence. If illicit products are displayed in the presence of FDA personnel, they must enforce the law. 

Many of the companies present at these trade shows have received warning letters from your agency and therefore should not be selling their products at all. On September 13, 2024, the FDA issued six new warning letters to manufacturers of illicit products that were present at the 2024 TPE. 

Given that these products and distributors are likely to appear at the 2025 Total Products and Alternative Products Expos, please respond to the below questions. 

  * Aside from the initial formation of a federal, multi-agency task force, what concrete steps has FDA taken with federal partners, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to ensure illicit products exhibited at the 2024 expos are not present at the 2025 expos? 
  * What metrics are currently utilized across agencies to assess the efficiency of FDA’s federal collaboration on illicit vaping products and ENDS? 
  * Has DOJ historically rejected FDA’s requests for enforcement actions such as civil monetary penalties or product seizures? If yes, please provide specific details of each instance. 
  * Considering FDA’s two recent import alerts announced this year,5 please provide details about the implementation of ‘detention without physical examination.’ Will the FDA keep record of violators at the point of detention for the purpose of future federal joint operations? If yes, will this list be made public for law enforcement in all jurisdictions? 
  * How does FDA, with federal partners, implement admission refusal and/or product destruction in cases such as the 53,700 ENDS seized by Chicago CBP? 



Please respond to this letter no later than January 24, 2025.

11:10:09 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Today, Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) released a statement after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) withdrew its proposal to Amend the North Atlantic Right Whale Vessel Strike Reduction Rule. 

The rule would broaden the boundaries and expand speed restrictions off of the Atlantic coast. This rule was not backed by scientific evidence and would cripple North Carolina’s coastal economy. 

On May 22, 2024, Senator Budd led members of the North Carolina delegation to send a  letter  to NOAA and the Office of Management and Budget, stating, “we call on you to withdraw this flawed rule and ask that NOAA further engage with stakeholders and explore alternatives that protect whales and coastal access.” 

Senator Budd said: 

“North Carolina’s coastline is a treasured part of our state and critical to our region. NOAA’s Right Whale Strike Reduction rule would have been extremely harmful to coastal economies in North Carolina. Its withdrawal is a victory for the Carolina coast and common sense.”

Full text of the letter: 

We are writing to express our concern that in light of the latest natural disaster occurring in California, FEMA might be tempted to pull personnel from Western North Carolina who are still vital to our ongoing recovery efforts. We urge you in the strongest manner possible not to draw down manpower from our devastated region. 

As members of Congress from the state of North Carolina, we are familiar with the destruction and despair communities experience during and following a natural disaster. While we recognize the urgency of addressing the devastation caused by these fires and extend our support in whatever other ways possible, we implore you to recognize the urgent needs that remain in North Carolina. 

Now that the $110 billion disaster relief package has been signed into law, it is critical that FEMA maintain its presence in the affected North Carolina counties to help deploy these resources and help our region recover from the most devastating natural disaster we have ever experienced. We also request that you notify us in advance should you otherwise determine resources should be removed from our great state. 

Thank you for understanding the needs of our constituency and keeping all the current FEMA personnel in place.

The funding will support preliminary reports into proposed water system improvements for Honaker. U.S. Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA) issued the following statement: 

“Rural communities, like many in Southwest Virginia, benefit from clean, potable water. 

“This USDA Rural Development grant for $30,000 helps the Town of Honaker produce a report that explores adding a well and storage tank to the current town water system.” 

BACKGROUND 

The funding is made available through the USDA Rural Development Special Evaluation Assistance for Rural Communities and Households, which directs funds to very small, financially distressed rural communities with predevelopment feasibility studies, design and technical assistance on proposed water and waste disposal projects. 

Honaker’s current water system include four wells, two storage tanks, and 96 linear feet of lines. An additional well and tank would increase the amount of potable water available to the community it serves.

Last November,  Congressman Ryan wrote directly to President Trump  , pledging to work across party lines to get SALT Deductibility Act signed into law 

Ryan: “I’ll go anywhere and work with anyone to end double taxation and bring down costs for Hudson Valley families” 

WASHINGTON, DC –  Today, Congressman Pat Ryan, Congressman Andrew Garbarino and the bipartisan SALT Caucus reintroduced the SALT Deductibility Act to fully remove the SALT cap once and for all. Last November, Ryan wrote directly to President Trump, pledging to work across party lines to get the SALT Deductibility Act signed into law, and calling on President Trump to immediately begin bipartisan negotiations. Last week,  Ryan urged President Trump  to include Democrats in any SALT discussions at Mar-A-Lago, arguing that bipartisan action is the only path forward. While Trump’s 2017 tax bill put the SALT cap in place, the former and future President promised on the campaign trail to “  get SALT back  (link is external)  .” 

“My number one goal is to lower costs for Hudson Valley families. Today, I’m proud to join my colleagues in putting partisanship aside and coming together to do just that,”  said Congressman Pat Ryan.  “Our constituents are feeling the pressure of making ends meet, and counting on us to deliver relief – we’re not letting double taxation go on any longer. I’ll go anywhere and work with anyone to fully remove the SALT cap.” 

The legislation is co-sponsored by Reps. Sean Casten (IL-6), Holmes Norton (DC), Danny Davis (IL-7), Thomas Kean (NJ-7), Judy Chu (CA-28), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Jerrold Nadler (NY-12), Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Laura Gillen (NY-4), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), and Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5). 

President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limited the SALT deduction to $10,000 per household. Not a single Democrat in the House voted for the bill. On the campaign trail, President-elect Trump pledged to “  get SALT back  (link is external)  .” 

Since his time serving as  Ulster County Executive, Ryan has fought  (link is external)  to eliminate the SALT cap and restore the SALT deduction. In  February 2023, Congressman Ryan  joined with colleagues to establish the bipartisan Congressional SALT Caucus for the 118th Congress. The Caucus is on the forefront of efforts to restore the SALT Tax deduction to provide significant relief for Hudson Valley families from unfair double taxation. Ryan cosponsors the SALT Deductibility Act and  has repeatedly made it clear  (link is external)  that he is a staunch champion for eliminating the SALT cap. 

Congressman Ryan has fought to deliver tax relief for Hudson Valley families, including voting for the  Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act  that included an Expanded Child Tax Credit that will uplift 40,000 kids in NY-18 alone and an Enhanced Low-Income Housing Tax Credit will develop more than 200,000 affordable housing units. 

Ryan also introduced the Working Families Housing Tax Credit Act as part of his four-bill  Housing Agenda  to lower housing costs for Hudson Valley families.

Ryan invites community to drop off cards at his Newburgh office to deliver to veterans in advance of Valentine’s Day 

WASHINGTON, DC –  Today, Congressman Pat Ryan kicked off his third annual “Valentines for Vets” initiative, inviting Hudson Valley community members to send or drop off cards to his Newburgh office to deliver to local veterans and veteran caregivers for Valentine’s Day. 

“Veterans put their lives on the line to keep us safe and protect our democracy - it’s the ultimate expression of love for their fellow Americans and for our country,”  said Congressman Pat Ryan.  “Each year, it’s been remarkable to see the community’s outpouring of gratitude to our local veterans. I’m looking forward to rallying together again this year to show them how much the Hudson Valley values their heroism and service.” 

In the program’s inaugural year in 2023, Congressman Ryan collected over 9,000 valentines made by Hudson Valley students and community members and hand-delivered them to veterans at Castle Point VA and Vassar Brothers Medical Center. Valentines were also delivered by his office to Hudson River Housing and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) across the Hudson Valley. 

Participants are asked to drop off or mail valentines to Congressman Pat Ryan’s Newburgh office at 605 Broadway, Newburgh, New York 12550. Cards should be postmarked no later than February 7, 2025 to ensure timely delivery. For in-person drop-off at the office, please deliver cards by February 11, 2025. If delivering multiple valentines, please include a count of the number of cards on a sheet of paper enclosed with the cards. Please contact Congressman Ryan’s district office at 845-443-2930 with any questions or for more information. 

Congressman Pat Ryan is a U.S. Army veteran, having served two combat tours in Iraq, and is the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in the U.S. House of Representatives. He sits on the House Armed Services Committee and has prioritized sponsoring and cosponsoring extensive legislation to deliver relief for veterans, service members, and military families. Ryan has hosted events celebrating veterans and connecting them with resources, including organizing a “Veterans Week of Action” in November 2023, hosting dozens of community partners for his Veterans and Military Families Resource Fair, and utilizing his mobile office, the C.A.R.E.S. Van, for a series of events bringing direct assistance to veterans at Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) across the Hudson Valley throughout the summer of 2024. Ryan recently hosted veterans from across the Hudson Valley for a breakfast in their honor where he recognized three veterans from Ulster, Orange, and Dutchess counties for their outstanding service to the nation and the Hudson Valley community.

11:10:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: Salem, Mass. – Congressman Seth Moulton is pleased to announce that 6th District company, Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), is slated to receive a federal investment of $105 million as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. 

ADI is a global leader in analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing technologies. ADI has an important presence in Massachusetts, with significant operations in Chelmsford and Wilmington. 

"The 6th District is home to many of our nation’s most cutting-edge technology manufacturers — and ADI is a prime example. Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act to help strengthen American manufacturing, sharpen our competitive edge, and bolster national security. I’m thrilled that this law is continuing to have a direct, local impact,” said  Congressman Moulton  . 

“Wilmington is proud to be the home of such an innovative company as Analog Devices. They have been a presence here in Town since 1981, and opened their global headquarters here in 2018, and all along the way, they have been a tremendous corporate partner to the Town,” said  Eric Slagle, Wilmington Town Manager  . “We are thrilled that they are getting this well-deserved grant from the Federal Government, and look forward to continuing our partnership for years to come.” 

ADI is at the forefront of innovation in the expansion of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing,” said  Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair at Analog Devices  . "Our focus on enabling innovation at the Intelligent Edge is driving advancements in process technologies that are critical to our global customer base. This investment will help us strengthen our workforce training and community partnerships, as well as expand our efforts to manage our environmental footprint. 

The Department of Commerce’s proposed investment of up to $105 million would support ADI’s projects in Massachusetts and the Pacific Northwest. The investment in Massachusetts would enable the company to increase module production output for its packaging and test facility, which would expand capacity for commercial, space, and defense applications as well as new commercial phased array antenna and sensor solutions. To advance the company’s workforce efforts and community investments, ADI plans to build on its partnerships with local universities, community colleges, and other education partners.

Vote Explainer: H.R. 30 - Preventing Violence Against Women By Illegal Aliens Act    
  
On Thursday, January 16, 2025, the House voted on the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act (H.R. 30). 

Violence against women is horrific. We absolutely should not tolerate violence committed by anyone, including migrants. 

Therefore, I understand why many reasonable people think this bill is a slam dunk: committing domestic violence should be a deportable offense. But let’s be clear: committing domestic abuse or sexual violence is  already  a deportable offense. 

Given the way the bill is drafted, many of my Democratic colleagues – as well as over 200 groups dedicated to serving victims of domestic violence – worry that the bill could inadvertently punish women who are  victims  of domestic abuse and sexual violence and make them subject to deportation. Critics of the bill argue that because the bill does not provide waivers, or grant discretion when  victims  of domestic abuse are caught up in an arrest, it could lead to scenarios where survivors who may have acted in self-defense are deported after being mistakenly accused of being an aggressor. 

Abusers know no shame. Abusers manipulate their victims, and in some cases, threaten to report their romantic partners to law enforcement in order to maintain control over their victims. 

With that said, I share the skepticism of many of my colleagues who find the loudest critics of the bill potentially overstating the number of people who could actually be harmed by the bill, especially given that it is already a deportable offense to be convicted of domestic violence. 

Congress and President Trump MUST stop playing games with immigration policy. Instead of trying to score political points against each other, we need bipartisan immigration reform that secures our borders, treats hard-working families humanely, and keeps our communities safe and prosperous. Trump already sunk a bipartisan Senate bill that would do these things in order to play politics with our borders during the election. Since he apparently controls what all Republicans do, it’s up to him to come to the table with real reforms, not messaging bills like this one. Real reform is what the American people have repeatedly asked for, and it’s what we all deserve.

Vote Explainer: H.R. 28 - The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act 

Today, the Republican majority will again bring up the “Protection of Women and Girls and Sports Act” for a full House vote. Just as I did in the 118th Congress, I will vote NO. This is not the sort of balanced, fairness-oriented policy I’ve advocated for, and I won’t vote yes on this bill just because it is the first option that comes to the floor. 

To be clear, I firmly believe that there should be reasonable restrictions on transgender athletes in competitive sports. This is a matter of safety and fairness for female athletes who have worked exceptionally hard to compete. There is no denying that there are biological differences that result from being born male. Ignoring this scientific fact and opposing  any  attempt at regulation is not only wrong, but it undermines what I believe should be a broader effort to enshrine core civil rights protections for transgender Americans. 

The problem with this Republican bill, however, is that it is too extreme; it simply goes too far. Because it fails to distinguish between children and adults and different levels of athletics, school-aged kids who simply want to play recreational sports and build camaraderie like everybody else could be targeted by the federal government. My kids play co-ed sports today just as I did when I was their age, and I don’t want any kids their age subjected to the invasive violations of personal privacy this bill allows. 

Under this law, a 10-year-old girl who seems “too tall” or even just “too good” could be targeted by officials and forced to release medical information or have her private parts inspected, which is disturbing to say the least and a slippery slope for school policy and youth athletics. 

While I’m a proud Democrat, I’ve stated my belief that our party has failed to come to the table in good faith to debate an issue on which the vast majority of Americans believe we are out of touch. We  should  be able to discuss regulations for trans athletes in competitive sports, while still staunchly defending the rights of transgender Americans to simply exist without fear of danger or oppression. But instead, we’ve run away from the issue altogether. As a result, Republicans are in charge and continue to set the agenda with extremist bills like this.

“The results of the Biden Administration’s shipbuilding investigation confirm that, for too long, China has been using tactics like state-sponsored subsidies and anti-competitive practices to cheat and undercut American shipbuilding. It’s time for bold action to address China’s unfair practices and rebuild our shipbuilding industry—not only to create good-paying jobs but also to bolster our national security and supply chains. We urge the incoming Administration to heed the results of this investigation and to implement the strongest possible measures to level the playing field for American shipbuilding workers.”    
  
Last April, Rep. Golden signed  a letter with 37 other Members of Congress  (link is external)  in support of a petition filed by a coalition of five labor unions urging USTR to initiate a Section 301 investigation into the acts, policies, and practices of China relating to competition in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. USTR subsequently announced that it would accept the petition.    
  
In October, Reps. Golden, DeLauro, Golden, Courtney, and Hoyle led  70 Members of Congress in a letter  (link is external)  supporting the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to protect American workers from China’s unfair practices in the shipbuilding industry.

11:10:25 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON — Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02) today introduced the  BUILT USA Act  to incentivize American manufacturing, tackle the trade deficit and create jobs by establishing a 10 percent tariff on all imports. 

“After decades of failed free trade agreements, the hollowing out of American industry and stagnating wages, we owe it to ourselves to ask real questions about what we prioritize in our economy,” Golden said. “The universal tariff — along with other policies to support domestic energy production, unions and manufacturing — is designed to reorient our economy from one focused on cheap goods and consumption to one centered on production and innovation.” 

According to an analysis last month by the Congressional Budget Office  (link is external)  (CBO), a universal 10 percent tariff would raise $2.2 trillion in revenue through 2034 — funds Golden advocates be used to reduce the deficit, subsidize American-made products and/or put money in middle-class families’ pockets by extending tax cuts set to expire this year. 

America was once the net exporter in the global market, but the era of free trade reversed the trend. The trade balance — the difference between U.S. exports and U.S. imports — has been in deficit since the mid-70s and in recent years, the trade deficit has reached nearly $1 trillion. 

Upon enactment, the  BUILT USA Act  (formally the  Balance Unequal International Labor and Trade for the United States of America Act  ) would assess a 10 percent tariff to all goods and services imported into the United States. Each subsequent calendar year, this duty would increase or decrease by 5 percent depending on whether America maintains a trade deficit or surplus, respectively. 

“America’s ever-expanding trade deficit is a clear sign that the current global trade regime is stacked against U.S. workers, industries, and communities,”  said  Oren Cass, founder and chief economist of American Compass.  “Rep. Golden’s  BUILT USA ACT  will address this global trade imbalance head-on, reassert U.S. economic interests, and help reestablish the industrial base that made America the most innovative, prosperous and resilient nation in the world.” 

“This bill represents a vital step toward generating revenue, driving economic growth and revitalizing America’s domestic industries,” s  aid Zach Mottl, Chairman of the Coalition for a Prosperous America.  “The heart of the American system of economics lies in empowering the middle class and fostering economic growth by supporting demand for U.S.-made goods. Millions of hardworking Americans have seen their wage growth stymied by imports and they deserve a system that ensures their wages rise faster than their costs. By tackling the trade deficit directly, this bill offers a pathway to strengthening U.S. industries and significantly reducing the debt burden. Tariffs proposed in this legislation are an essential tool to ensure the U.S. economy works for American workers and producers, not foreign competitors.” 

The recent CBO analysis also found that while the 10 percent universal tariff could spur a short-term increase in prices of  some  foreign goods and services, it would likely  reduce  the cost of other goods and services, spur income growth in domestic industries and have no long-term effect on inflation. 

Background: 

Seventy years ago, employment in manufacturing made up more than  40 percent  (link is external)  of nonfarm jobs in Maine, according to the Maine Department of Labor. Today, it’s less than  10 percent  (link is external)  . The losses  accelerated in the 1990s with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  (link is external)  , after which Maine lost one in three manufacturing jobs — with 25,000 lost to outsourcing alone. Forty percent of those who lost jobs had to take new ones with lower pay. 

Golden has been a leading voice for reconfiguring U.S. trade policy in favor of American industry and workers. He also  released the  BUILT USA Act  (link is external)  during the 118th Congress and  introduced legislation  that would raise tariffs on Chinese imports of automobiles and energy components. He  published an essay  (link is external)  the same month on the importance of a robust production economy for national security and middle-class prosperity. 

In 2019, he was one of only 41 House members to  vote against  (link is external)  the United States-Mexico -Canada Agreement, which he called “  a missed opportunity to deliver real and lasting change  ” to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

I look forward to the implementation of a final agreement that ensures that all remaining hostages are returned home to their families and that Hamas lays down the weapons it took up when it started this conflict. If Hamas abides by the terms of such an agreement, I believe there can be a path towards a more lasting peace in the region.”

11:10:28 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:10:28 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON — Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02) today was appointed to the House Natural Resources Committee, giving him a prime position to advocate for critical and cherished state industries, protect Mainers’ quality of life and fight side-by-side with Maine’s indigenous communities to champion equal rights for the Wabanaki peoples. 

“Maine’s culture and economy are inextricably linked to our abundance of natural resources,”  Golden said.  “Families in our state hunt and fish in our lands and waters, harvest timber in the Maine woods and create outdoor recreation opportunities for each other and visitors alike — all while serving as thoughtful stewards of our environment. I am honored to serve on this committee, where I can advocate for Mainers and our way of life, whether that’s defending our lobstermen from onerous and unnecessary regulations, backing the Wabanaki peoples in their fight for tribal sovereignty or supporting policies to ensure America’s energy independence.” 

The House Natural Resources Committee’s jurisdiction includes fisheries and wildlife regulations, public lands, domestic energy production, mineral lands and mining, and Native American issues. 

On the Committee, Golden will be a key player in policy debates over regulations affecting Maine’s lobster fishery. Maine’s lobster industry generates $1.4 billion annually and is the lifeblood of communities up and down the Maine coast. During his time in Congress, Golden has been a fierce advocate for lobstermen, from passing a moratorium on burdensome right whale regulations that threatened to take fishermen off the water for good to opposing the development of wind farms in critical Maine fishing waters. 

Golden has also stood side-by-side with the Wabanaki Alliance, which represents Maine’s four Native American tribes, in their fight for self-determination. In 2022, the House passed Golden’s “Advancing Equality for Wabanaki Nations Act,” a bill to correct a longstanding injustice that prevents the Mi’kmaq Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation from exercising the same right to self-governance afforded to tribes in other states. The bill was later killed in the Senate; Golden has pledged to continue working with the Wabanaki Nations on their priorities. 

Maine’s 2nd Congressional District is home to Acadia National Park — one of the ten most visited national parks in the United States — and the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. With annual visitation numbers continuing to increase, these public lands need significant infrastructure investments. In the 118th Congress, Golden passed the “Great American Outdoors Act,” to address maintenance backlogs at places such as Acadia and to establish permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 

What they’re saying: 

  * Dustin Delano, chief operating officer, New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association (NEFSA):  “NEFSA would like to congratulate Congressman Golden on his appointment to the House Committee on Natural Resources. The congressman has proven to be a one-of-a-kind advocate for commercial fishermen, and we look forward to having our voices further represented.” 
  * Virginia Olsen, lobsterman and director of Maine Lobstering Union, Local 207:  “Our union is thrilled to learn Rep. Golden will serve on the Natural Resources Committee. We look forward to his continued work on behalf of Maine lobstermen in the face of regulatory changes in Washington, D.C. His efforts to support our industry and promote economic development resonate strongly with the working men and women who prioritize their heritage, sustainable practices and community well-being.” 
  * Maulian Bryant, executive director, Wabanaki Alliance:  “Rep. Jared Golden serving on the Natural Resources Committee is great news for all people of Maine, including the Wabanaki nations. The Wabanaki Alliance continues to be deeply honored by the commitment and genuine dedication the congressman has shown with his efforts to restore important tribal sovereignty and self-determination rights to our nations. We look forward to any future collaborations we have with Rep. Golden, and we know that his work with Wabanaki people will serve him well and inform his work on this critically important committee. We are grateful to Rep. Golden for being a true champion for the Wabanaki, especially on issues related to a sacred priority for all of us, the health and wellbeing of Mother Earth.” 
  * Eric Stiles, president and CEO, Friends of Acadia:  “Congressman Jared Golden’s appointment to the House Natural Resources Committee is a tremendous win for Maine’s people, visitors and treasured landscapes. As a steadfast advocate for outdoor recreation and our National Parks, the Congressman understands the critical role Acadia National Park and Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument play in our economy, generating over $680 million annually and supporting over 6,500 jobs across the state. We thank Congressman Golden for championing common-sense conservation efforts that ensure Maine’s natural wonders remain a source of inspiration, recreation and economic vitality for generations to come.” 



In addition to the Committee on Natural Resources, Golden will continue to serve on the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), on which he has served since 2019. On HASC, Golden will continue to advocate for service members, veterans, and their families, and to support the ongoing production of American warships at Bath Iron Works.

11:10:29 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:10:29 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  — U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, and U.S. Representatives Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, today are announcing the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) decision to award $22 million in funding for Maine’s  Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub  (link is external)  , led by the Maine Technology Institute. The grant will support the advancement of two projects that aim to further position Maine as a global leader in forest-based biomaterial production and manufacturing. 

“Maine is a leader in the forest products industry — both here at home and around the globe,”  said the Delegation  . “An investment in our forestry sector is a direct investment into Maine’s economy and future. This $22 million award for the Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub will be critical in ensuring we have the tools to strengthen the workforce, spur innovation and further build upon the industry’s success.”    
  
The grant will support implementation of two projects that include: 

  * Connecting forest bioproducts technological innovations with the commercialization resources and partnerships necessary to successfully bring that intellectual property to market at a globally competitive scale and serving as the backbone organization for the consortium, coordinating governance, strategy, evaluation, and community engagement; and 
  * Strengthening a pipeline of innovations (functionalized feedstocks, applications, and manufacturing technologies), de-risking these innovations with technical assistance, and leveraging new commercialization, advanced manufacturing, and workforce resources of the Tech Hub to accelerate the most promising innovations. 



Last March, the Delegation  wrote a letter  (link is external)  to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development expressing their support for Maine’s application for a Tech Hubs Implementation grant. In addition to the Delegation letter, Senator Collins sent a follow-up  letter  (link is external)  advocating for this program to receive Tech Hubs grant funding. Previously, the Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub received a $500,000 Consortium Accelerator Award to continue implementing their strategies, including the pursuit of additional capital, and was among six Tech Hubs across the country to receive awards from additional funding through the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 

The Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub is among  31 Tech Hubs  (link is external)  designated in October 2023 designated by the Department of Commerce to scale up the production of critical technologies, create jobs in innovative industries, strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness and national security, and accelerate the growth of industries of the future in regions across the United States. 

In 2016, Senators Collins and King called on the  U.S. Department of Commerce to establish the Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT)  (link is external)  , that would work across agencies and sectors to create strategies for job growth and economic development in Maine’s rural communities. The creation of the EDAT and its subsequent studies and research led to the EDA and the U.S. Forest Service providing funding for the Forest Opportunity Roadmap Maine (FOR/ME) Initiative. The  FOR/ME Initiative  (link is external)  is a participant-led initiative that is helping to diversify the state’s wood products businesses, attract investments, support research and development, and develop greater economic prosperity for rural communities impacted by mill closures.

11:10:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON — Community projects including the construction of new child care and fire department facilities in the 2nd Congressional District will receive millions of dollars in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grants announced today. 

Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02) celebrated the announcement of the latest round of funding through the Community Development Block Grant, which he has long supported throughout the appropriations process. 

“Directly investing in rural America is one of the most impactful ways Congress can keep small communities safe and prosperous,”  Golden said.  “Each of these projects will make a meaningful difference for Maine families and I’m glad they’re getting the resources needed to break ground.” 

According to the USDA, the projects will serve more than 70,000 Mainers in total. The funding breakdown for the four projects is as follows: 

  * $750,000 to the Beth Brunswick Memorial Fund for Children  to construct a 5,000 square foot child care facility in Rangeley; 
  * $1,567,000 to the Town of Hancock  to replace the Cemetery Road fire station with modernized two-story, 6,500+ square foot facility; 
  * $115,000 to the Millinocket Memorial Library  to complete essential accessibility improvements, including a modernized elevator and new basement ramp; 
  * $100,000 to Responsible Pet Care  to construct and expand pet shelter and adoption operations in Norway. 



The Community Facilities Grant program provides competitive loan and grant opportunities to municipalities, tribes, and community-based nonprofits in rural areas. In addition to child care and public safety, past funding has helped improve education, recreational opportunities, and health care in rural Maine. 

More information about each of the newly funded projects can be found on the USDA’s website.  (link is external)

11:10:35 root         DEBUG    Desc: LAS VEGAS –  Today,  Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03)  announced more than $23 million in investments to support fish and wildlife conservation as well as outdoor access in Nevada. 

This is part of a broader investment of over $1.3 billion to support U.S. states, commonwealths, and territories in their efforts to support conservation and connect people with nature. Collectively, these funds — disbursed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — are designated for the administration of state fish and wildlife agency programs, and they provide resources for various types of conservation, public access, safety, education, and habitat initiatives. Specifically, the investments in Nevada come in two batches: 

  * $17,016,823 in Wildlife Restoration investments  for public hunting access, hunter education, wildlife management and research, and the maintenance of target ranges. 
  * $6,290,520 in Sport Fish Restoration investments  for sport fish management and conservation, raising and stocking fish, habitat protection and enhancement, education, and constructing and maintaining fishing and boating access. 



“Not only is Nevada home to amazing natural landscapes, but it’s also one of the most biodiverse places in the country. This is how we support that biodiversity,”  said Congresswoman Susie Lee  . “I’m committed to ensuring that our public lands are protected and enjoyable for all, and I look forward to continuing to work with state and federal partners to keep investing in these conservation efforts.” 

The investments are made possible by a nearly century-old state-industry-federal partnership, with funding generated by manufacturers who paid federal excise taxes last year on ammunition, firearms, archery and angling equipment, and a fuel and small engine tax. Since 1937, more than $29 billion has been distributed through annual apportionments to monitor and manage our nation’s fish and wildlife resources, support hunter and aquatic education, and improve access for outdoor activities like hunting, fishing and boating.

“As a former high school and college swimmer, I do not support transgender athletes competing in girls’ and women’s sports when fairness or safety is compromised. 

“While I believe governing athletic bodies, like the NCAA, have been slow and inconsistent in updating their policies, the answer is not for the U.S. Congress to institute a nationwide ban for all ages. This is an extremely complicated issue that requires very serious deliberation and updated rulemaking by appropriate governing athletic bodies to address the portion of athletics where fairness or safety is an issue. 

“I opposed this extreme bill because it is government overreach at its finest, it exposes girls and women to genital exams, and it leads to attacks based solely on personal appearance. Genital exams make female athletes a ripe target for sexual predators – already a very real threat. In fact, according to a 2022 study, one in three elite athletes and nearly one in two recreational athletes reported being a victim of sexual harassment and abuse within a 12-month period. 

“Sports taught me resilience, hard work, camaraderie, and teamwork. We should be working to ensure girls and women have safe, fair, and expanded opportunities to participate in sports. But this bill will make all female athletes less safe.”

11:10:40 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Shontel Brown introduced a resolution to honor the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was born on January 15, 1929, and on Monday, the nation will observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. 

Congresswoman Brown’s resolution serves as a tribute to Dr. King’s unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and peace, emphasizing the importance of diversity, tolerance, and the fight against hate in our society. The resolution is cosponsored by 63 Members of the House of Representatives.

He fought not just to end oppression but to create opportunity, reject hate, and persist in the pursuit of equality. At a time when the values of equity and representation are under attack, his vision for a more inclusive and loving society remains as relevant today as ever. Let us answer Dr. King’s call in our time by rejecting hate in all its forms and fostering a society where every person is treated with dignity and respect.”  said Congresswoman Brown  .

##  Congresswoman Brown’s resolution reads as follows: 

Honoring Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by celebrating diversity, promoting tolerance, and condemning hate. 

Whereas the Nation will celebrate the 96th anniversary of the birth of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on Mon- day, January 20, 2025; 

Whereas Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. taught that the blessing of diversity is our strength; 

Whereas Dr. King fought, marched, and preached for the inalienable rights of all people, particularly Black Americans; 

Whereas among these rights is the inviolable right of every person to cast their vote and make their voice heard in a representative democracy; 

Whereas tolerance for one another’s difference in race, ethnicity, gender, culture, religion, sexual orientation, age, or disability is a profound virtue; 

Whereas civil discourse in a land of democratic freedom is the true promise of our country; and 

Whereas, Dr. King once wrote in his 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, “Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly’’: Now, therefore, be it 

resolved that the House of Representatives: 

Celebrates the 96th anniversary of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King’s birth on January 15, 2025, shall serve as a reminder that hate and hateful conduct based on differences has no place in America, in tribute to his life and teachings; 

Affirms Dr. King’s words “Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds”; 

Honors the life, legacy, works, and heroism of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; 

Condemns any form of harassment, discrimination or prejudice targeted at any minority ethnic group, including but not limited to the Black community, Indigenous people, the Jewish community, the Asian American and Pacific Islanders community, the Muslim community, and the Hispanic and Latino communities; 

Condemns any form of harassment, discrimination or prejudice based on a person’s gender, including but not limited to the trans community and LGBTQ+ individuals; 

Abhors the violence and senselessness that led to his untimely death; and 

Calls on all people across this nation and the world to uphold his values and teachings of justice, equality, peace, advocacy, and tolerance. 

Congresswoman Brown also shares one of her favorite quotes by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from his 1967 speech  “The Other America”:  (link is external) 

“And we must see racism for what it is. It is a myth of the superior and the inferior race. It is the false and tragic notion that one particular group, one particular race is responsible for all of the progress, all of the insights in the total flow of history. And the theory that another group or another race is totally depraved, innately impure, and innately inferior. In the final analysis, racism is evil because its ultimate logic is genocide. If one says that I am not good enough to live next door to him; if one says that I am not good enough to eat at a lunch counter, or to have a good, decent job, or to go to school with him merely because of my race, he is saying consciously or unconsciously that I do not deserve to exist.”

11:10:41 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congresswoman Shontel Brown (OH-11) today thanked the President and Vice President for their public serves after President Biden delivered his farewell address to the nation. 

“I want thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for four years of principled, purposeful, and powerful service to the American people. They guided our nation through an unprecedented pandemic, delivered meaningful results for working families, and restored dignity and decency to the White House. Thanks to their steady and steadfast leadership, we are stronger, more prosperous, and more secure today. 

“They delivered historic, job-creating investments in infrastructure projects like lead pipe removal on Cleveland’s east side, new rail cars for RTA, the City’s critical North Coast Connector, and countless road and bridge upgrades that are making our communities safer and more connected. They drove down healthcare costs by capping the cost of insulin for seniors, setting a new $2,000 out-of-pocket prescription drug max for folks that rely on Medicare, and expanding Affordable Care Act subsidies. From delivering the first expansion of Social Security in decades and pushing through landmark student loan forgiveness to saving union pension programs and strengthening consumer protections, theirs is a legacy of progress and results for the American people. 

“The Biden-Harris record is too long to adequately detail in one quote. Thanks to their efforts, families in Cleveland are benefiting from lower healthcare costs, modernized infrastructure, cleaner drinking water and air, safer streets, and expanded access to affordable housing. These achievements will resonate for decades, proving that when Americans come together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. Thank you, President Biden and Vice President Harris, for your transformative service and for always fighting for working families in Northeast Ohio and across America.” 

##  Key Wins for Northeast Ohio Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats: 

  * Over $11 billion in infrastructure funding for over 474 projects in Ohio, announced to date, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 

  * Over $200 million for clean energy infrastructure projects in OH-11, announced to date, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act 

  * Insulin prices capped at $35 per month for over 4,000 seniors in OH-11, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act 

  * Out-of-pocket prescription drug costs capped at $2,000 per year for 53,000 seniors in OH-11, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act 

  * Over $7 million in public safety and student well-being funding awarded to schools and cities in OH-11, thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 

  * Expanded benefits for over 1,600 veterans in OH-11 exposed to toxic chemicals during their service, thanks to the PACT Act 

  * Expanded Social Security benefits for over 230,000 Ohioans, thanks to the Social Security Fairness Act

11:10:42 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, DC – Congresswoman Shontel Brown (OH-11) released the following statement after President Biden announced Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal: 

“I welcome the much-anticipated announcement that a ceasefire and hostage release deal has been struck. And I want to thank President Biden and his Administration for their tireless diplomacy and steadfast commitment over the last 15 months to getting this deal done and bringing the hostages home. 

“Finally, after 15 months in captivity, hostages will be released and reunited with their families. While we embrace this news, we also remember the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack which was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the hostages who were killed in captivity, and the innocent lives cut tragically short in Gaza. This moment holds the promise of bringing an end to the fighting, delivering needed aid to Palestinian civilians, and providing a path to lasting stability and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. 

“I urge all parties to adhere to the conditions of the deal to ensure the war is ended for good and every single hostage is released. Upholding the agreement is the first step towards the hard yet critical work ahead of building peace in the region.”

The bill's passage follows a  bipartisan letter  led by Congressman Bera and signed by 102 Members last month, urging House and Senate leadership to advance critical U.S.-Taiwan double taxation relief measures. 

"The passage of this bill is a critical step toward strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan economic partnership and ensuring vital supply chains remain resilient,"  said Representative Bera.  "Existing tax policies discourage companies in America and Taiwan from making reciprocal investments that drive innovation and economic growth. This bill will reduce costs for businesses, encourage greater foreign direct investment between Taiwan and the U.S. in critical industries like semiconductors, and enhance economic cooperation between the United States and Taiwan. The House has shown strong bipartisan support for this effort, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to get this bill across the finish line."

“Today's news of a ceasefire and hostage deal will bring an end to the fighting in Gaza, reunite hostages with their families, and deliver much-needed aid to Palestinian civilians. Securing this breakthrough is the result of months of painstaking and relentless diplomacy and leadership by the Biden administration. 

“It is critical to remember that this devastating war began with Hamas' brutal attacks on October 7th, during which innocent Israelis and Americans were abducted and held captive, and 1,200 more were senselessly slaughtered. Every hostage taken, every family shattered, and every Israeli, Palestinian and foreign national killed over these past 15 months underscores the immense human cost of this conflict. 

“The path forward will be difficult, and our work is far from finished. Hamas must release all remaining hostages, be fully disarmed, and end its oppressive rule over Gaza. I urge the incoming Administration to continue working with our regional partners to achieve this goal and move toward a lasting peace–– one that ensures Israel’s security and upholds the right of the Palestinian people to live in peace and dignity.”

11:10:59 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. —  Congresswoman Betty McCollum (DFL, MN-04) announced on Thursday morning that she will continue serving on the House Appropriations Committee during the 119  th  Congress, the committee which funds the federal government. Congresswoman McCollum will serve her third term as the top Democrat on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in addition to serving as the number two Democrat on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. 

“It is an honor to continue to serve on the Appropriations Committee this Congress,” McCollum said. “I look forward to my ongoing work with my colleagues to deliver for Minnesotans and all Americans by investing in excellence in education, protecting the environment, expanding health care access, fiscal responsibility, and robust international engagement that prioritizes diplomacy, development, human rights, along with a strong national defense.” 

“As the Ranking Member on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I’m committed to maintaining and advancing the security of our great nation that also drives innovation that puts Americans to work,” added McCollum. “We face a host of challenges around the globe, including Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and increasing provocations by China. This moment calls for more American leadership, not less. As the Ranking Democrat on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to lead efforts to support our allies and advance American values abroad.” 

In the 119  th  Congress, Congresswoman McCollum will bring a commonsense perspective to her work as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. The Congresswoman believes that a strong Defense Department begins by providing for the servicemembers who make up the U.S. Armed Forces. Our soldiers must continue to receive the best training, equipment, and technology available to them. 

Congresswoman McCollum will also serve as the second-ranking Democrat on the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, a subcommittee which she led as chair during the 116  th  Congress. During the 119th Congress, McCollum will prioritize investments in Indian Country and protecting our clean air and water, our wilderness and public lands, and our nation's natural treasures.

11:11:00 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday afternoon, the Biden Administration announced that the government of Israel and terrorist organization Hamas agreed to a six-week ceasefire deal that will pause Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza and include the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. After the announcement was made public, Congresswoman Betty McCollum (MN-04) released the following statement:   
  
“After fifteen months of bloodshed and heartbreak, Palestinians and Israelis can finally breathe a sigh of relief,” said Congresswoman McCollum. “While we celebrate this breakthrough, it is critical that all parties involved continue to work together to sustain a long-term regional ceasefire to avert future hostilities. In this moment, my heart is with the families of the hostages who have waited too long for their loved ones to return, and also with the people of Palestine who have suffered catastrophic civilian loss of life and will return to their communities to find only destruction.”   
  
“In the coming weeks, the United States, our international partners, and the United Nations must work to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The global community must rally behind this effort. As we work toward achieving lasting peace in the region, Palestinians must have the right to self-determination in Gaza and the West Bank, and Israel must be guaranteed by its neighbors to live in peace without threats to their security.”

11:16:10 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-17
11:16:10 root         DEBUG    Desc: Today, Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH5) released the following statement following the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was signed into law to prevent app store availability or web hosting services in the U.S. for TikTok unless the app divests from Chinese Communist Party-controlled parent company ByteDance: 

“When crafting this bipartisan, bicameral bill, we made it clear TikTok could remain active in the U.S. if they divested from their Chinese Communist Party controlled parent company, ByteDance. Instead of working for the past several months to divest and keep the app operational, TikTok chose to pursue legal action to overturn our law. No matter how TikTok spins this, it’s clear they cannot or simply refuse to sever ties with the Chinese Communist Party. It should disturb every single American that they chose this path instead of working to divest and keep the app operational in the United States. Here’s the bottom line: TikTok has no one to blame but themselves for this outcome. I applaud the Supreme Court for unanimously upholding our law to ensure foreign adversaries – like communist China – will not control applications that target, surveil, and manipulate Americans.” 

Latta  helped introduce  the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversaries Controlled Applications Act in March of 2024, where it received swift, bipartisan approval by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate.

“My presence at the inauguration will be my way of saying “I see you and I know what you’re about. And I won’t be intimidated by you.” It will be a way to show Americans and viewers across the world that I respect the vote of the people, unlike Trump himself. Four years on, he’s still lying about the 2020 Election. And Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate are not just complicit in these lies; they facilitated them, and they are now trapped by them. Their fealty to Trump and his ridiculous lie have revealed their willingness to give away their own legislative power. Of course, it’s bad for our democratic institutions, but it’s also bad for the voters who sent them here to work on their behalf. Americans don’t want massive tax giveaways to billionaires. They don’t want Social Security and Medicare to be on the chopping block. They want real relief from an economy that’s rigged against them.”

11:16:18 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – In response to the reported Israeli government and Hamas ceasefire and hostage agreement, Rep. Becca Balint (VT-AL) released the following statement: 

“Finalizing a ceasefire deal is extremely welcome news. I’m relieved to finally end the horrific suffering and violence of the last 15 months. The surviving hostages will be reunited with their families at last, and the bombs will stop. But the humanitarian crisis in Gaza will continue to demand the world’s attention. This is a critical first step in rebuilding the political stability and safety of the entire region and securing a free and self-determined Palestine. Attentive and serious diplomacy will be imperative to achieving true lasting peace and a safer future for Palestinians and Israelis.”

11:16:19 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:16:19 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  — Today, Rep. Becca Balint (VT-AL) spoke on the House Floor to condemn  H.R. 28  , a hateful bill that invades the privacy of children and puts trans Americans at further risk. This ban could subject elementary school aged kids to interrogation and examinations from unknown adults. View the speech  here  . 

Her remarks below: 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in fierce opposition to this bill. 

Trans Americans are not the problem. This obsession with monitoring kids' genitals is absolutely the problem. 

Let's be clear. This is about kids. My kids, your kids, all kids. All kids, even elementary school kids playing basketball. 

I'm a mom of two teens. I'm a former teacher. I know what kids are going through in school. They are already self-conscious about their bodies. They just want to be on the soccer field with their friends. They certainly do not want to be humiliated by members of Congress. 

So, come on, let's talk about what enforcement looks like, because you guys, you don't want to talk about it. We know there is only one logical conclusion to this. This is interrogation of young girls. About their bodies. This is asking people to show them what is underneath their underwear. 

That is what we’re talking about. This is the logical conclusion for this bill. 

So, it's vile. It's twisted. They don't want to talk about the details. It's an absolute invasion of children's privacy. 

Far from protecting anyone, it puts our children at risk. And actually, I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this government overreach. 

I yield back. 

As the first openly queer person to represent Vermont in Congress, Rep. Balint is a fierce advocate for LGBTQI+ rights and a  voice  in Congress for trans rights. She serves as Co-Chair of the Equality Caucus.

11:16:20 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:16:20 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C.  – Today, Rep. Becca Balint (VT-AL) was elected Vice Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, the number two spot for Democrats on the committee. Rep. Balint will serve on the House Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Ranking Member Jamie Raskin. This will be Rep. Balint’s second term serving on the House Judiciary Committee. 

“The House Judiciary Committee will be the center of so much of the essential civil rights and democracy work ahead. I’m honored to work with Ranking Member Raskin to lead our members through these critical fights – taking on corporate greed, shoring up reproductive freedoms, preventing gun violence, strengthening our democracy and voting rights, and defending LGBTQI+ rights. The next few years will bring challenges, but I’m looking forward to drawing on my clarity of purpose as we face direct attacks on our civil liberties and freedoms by the incoming far-right Trump Administration. It’s time to get to work on behalf of the rights and needs of working people across the country,”  said Rep. Becca Balint. 

“I am happy to announce that Vermont’s beloved Rep. Becca Balint will be serving alongside me as the Vice Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee for the 119th Congress,”  said Ranking Member Raskin.  “As a seasoned leader and strong voice on matters for democracy and civil rights, Rep. Balint will bring a fresh perspective, masterful debate skills, and a great passion for the mission ahead as Committee Democrats head into the breach to defend Americans’ civil liberties and our Constitutional order. She brings to this role a rich depth of experience, having served as an educator, activist, and leader in the Vermont State Senate—where she led the passage of the first gun safety laws in the state’s history. I am confident Rep. Balint will be a powerful force in countering the chaos of our Republican colleagues as well as an effective partner in our work to advance pragmatic solutions to the issues facing Americans. 

“I hope my colleagues will join me in welcoming Rep. Balint to this new post,”  continued Raskin.   
  
“Rep. Becca Balint will be an excellent Vice Ranking Member of the esteemed House Judiciary Committee in the 119th Congress, and her well-deserved appointment is a reflection of her exceptional talents and strong leadership in Vermont and beyond. Collaborating closely with Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, this committee will address critical challenges and advance meaningful initiatives for the American people. I look forward to witnessing all that Rep. Balint will achieve in this vital role,” said  Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse  .    


The Judiciary Committee is at the forefront of some of the issues most important to Vermonters and all Americans, including protecting freedom and civil liberties, oversight of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, with jurisdiction over antitrust laws, terrorism and crime, gun violence prevention and immigration reform. 

Rep. Balint will serve as a member of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust and the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government.

“Domestic violence is a serious offense that affect too many of our communities. As a domestic violence survivor, I know what’s it like to fear for my life. And I know how incredibly difficult and often dangerous it is to come forward to report abuse. Undocumented survivors face even more barriers. 

Current immigration laws already impose immigration bars on those who are convicted of serious crimes, including offenses related to sexual and domestic violence. Under current law, people who are convicted of domestic violence can be deported. And those who are convicted of, or admit to committing, crimes like domestic violence and sexual assault can be deemed inadmissible and not allowed to adjust their immigration status. 

In addition to other concerns about needless expansion to include noncriminal conduct or conduct for which no conviction has been made, this legislation lacks protections to ensure undocumented survivors don’t face deportation, which will discourage them from calling the police or reporting their abuser in the first place. And the inadmissibility provisions mean that more immigrant survivors with lawful status will also be affected. 

As noted by many respected advocacy groups, this legislation would make vulnerable survivors more vulnerable, putting them at great risk if they act in self-defense or if an abuser makes a false police report. That’s why I stand in opposition to this legislation today and sought to include an amendment that would explicitly protect survivors from deportation. My amendment would provide authority to waive the inadmissibility and deportation provisions of the bill for those who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty and who were was not the primary perpetrator of violence in the relationship. 

The scourge of domestic violence is far too serious to be weaponized for political points. Instead, we need to replenish the Victims of Crimes Act funding which has reached critical lows resulting in cuts to services provided by organizations who serve survivors and their children and help connect them with emergency resources like housing and food. We should advance my proposal, the Protect Moms from Domestic Violence Act to further study homicides as the leading cause of death for pregnant women. Instead of pushing political stunts that only demonize immigrants, this GOP-led Congress should help meet these urgent needs for survivors.”

My heart rejoices with the families who will finally see their loved ones again. Similarly, more humanitarian aid must mean Palestinian civilians are able to adequately feed and support their families, including the children who have suffered tremendously throughout this conflict. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will be indispensable to that effort, and it would be wise for the U.S. to end its funding ban, as many of our allies have done, to make sure that humanitarian needs are truly met. 

The hardest work remains ahead. This initial ceasefire can set grounds for negotiations for an enduring one. The incoming Administration must now advance a plan for how to turn this moment into long-term peace.”

11:16:27 root         DEBUG    Titles: Congressman Krishnamoorthi and Ranking Member Connolly Call on Oversight Committee to Conduct Hearing on Health Insurance Conglomerates Limiting and Denying Access to Coverage
11:16:27 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:16:27 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and Oversight and Reform Committee Ranking Member Gerry Connolly (D-VA) sent a letter to Chairman James Comer (R-KY) requesting the committee conduct a hearing on commercial health insurance conglomerates limiting and denying access to medically appropriate care. A health insurer recently announced it would not cover additional anesthesia if a procedure extended beyond the company’s own arbitrary time limit, even if a medical complication or emergency warranted more time. That policy, which has since been suspended following strong backlash from patients and health care professionals, could have resulted in a patient and their families having to pay out of pocket for anesthesia following a potentially life-threatening situation. 

“Patients – our constituents – are concerned that they may be denied access to needed health care services because of insurers’ focus on profits over patient care,” the members wrote in the letter. “Congress should question whether we can continue to count on health insurance conglomerates to police themselves and their policies. An oversight hearing would allow our Committee to fully explore this question. Immediate action is necessary to hold insurance companies accountable and to prevent others from following suit.” 

"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers has been going on for some time. Insurance companies are simply looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,” Don Arnold, MD, President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, said. 

“The Illinois Society of Anesthesiologists (ISA) strongly supports congressional oversight hearing to examine commercial health insurance policies that jeopardize patient health and undermine physicians' ability to provide safe, effective care, as highlighted by the recent Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield controversy,” Jason Mitchell, MD, President of the Illinois Society of Anesthesiologists, said. 

Limits on anesthesia care are just a recent example in a long line of alarming health insurance conglomerate procedures and practices. In their letter, Congressman Krishnamoorthi and Ranking Member Connolly cite several other policies that have come under scrutiny by the public that limit, deny, and delay access to needed and critical health care, including practices such as prior authorization and step therapy, or “fair first.” 

Congressman Krishnamoorthi has been a leader on the Oversight Committee in calling for the committee to take up more hearings and discussions surrounding the state of the U.S. health care system. In December, Congressman Krishnamoorthi called on Congress to take urgent action regarding  Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)  , aiming to lower the costs of prescription drugs for Americans and protect the local and independent pharmacies millions depend on.

11:16:29 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-14
11:16:29 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) introduced a bipartisan resolution designating January as Tamil Language and Heritage Month. More than 80 million people worldwide, including 360,000 Americans, speak Tamil, one of the world’s oldest languages. The resolution coincides with Pongal, a major Tamil festival that begins in mid-January. Pongal, celebrated as a time of gratitude and prosperity, is also a time when those in the Tamil community come together to observe with family, friends, and loved ones. 

“As a Tamil American, I am proud to introduce this bipartisan resolution honoring the Tamil language, heritage, and culture here at home in the United States and around the world,” Congressman Krishnamoorhi said. “America is a mosaic of different languages, cultures, ideas, and traditions, and it is my sincere hope that this resolution will shine a light on the rich and distinct culture, as well as the incredible achievements, of the more than 350,000 Tamil Americans today. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to swiftly take up this resolution to recognize the impact Tamil Americans have in our communities.” 

“Tamil Americans United PAC wholeheartedly welcomes and deeply appreciates Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi and the members of Congress for introducing this significant legislation, which highlights the rich history of the ancient Tamil people and their invaluable contributions to the modern world,” Tamil Americans United PAC said. “We urge Tamil Americans to actively and effectively engage in efforts to ensure the successful passage of this legislation in the United States Congress.” 

"As proud Tamil Americans, we strongly support Rep. Krishnamoorthi’s resolution to create a Tamil Language and Heritage Month,” Federation of Tamil Sangams of North American (FeTNA) said. “Tamils have much to contribute to this dear country we call our home, and showcasing our history, language, and culture will allow us to meaningfully share what we have with our fellow citizens." 

“We thank Rep. Krishnamoorthi for spearheading the effort to designate January as Tamil Language and Heritage Month and urge the U.S. Congress to pass this resolution with all due speed,” U.S. Tamil Action Group (USTAG). “Tamil Americans cherish our rich and ancient language, traditions and culture and know that we have much to contribute to America's own unique and vibrant patchwork of traditions.” 

"PEARL appreciates the leadership of Congressman Krishnamoorthi on this resolution, which celebrates the invaluable contributions of the Tamil community to the United States across generations,” People for Equality and Relief in Lanka (PEARL) said. “The resolution highlights the extensive history and cultural richness of the Tamil people. Recognizing Tamil Heritage Month reinforces the incredible diversity that defines and strengthens American society." 

Congressman Krishnamoorthi was joined in introducing the resolution by Reps. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Shri Thanedar (D-MI), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Suhas Subramanyam (D-VA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Ami Bera (D-CA) , Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Yevette Clark (D-NY), Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Debroah Ross (D-NC), Danny Davis (D-IL), Dina Titus (D-NV), Don Davis (D-NC), and Summer Lee (D-PA).

11:16:31 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON, D.C.  — Today,  Congresswoman Diana DeGette (CO-01)  released the following statement after she was announced as the top Democrat on the Energy & Commerce Health Subcommittee. 

“I am honored to serve as the top Democrat on the Health Subcommittee for the 119th Congress. Throughout my career, I have worked to lower health care costs, deliver innovative cures and treatments to patients, and make sure the health care system works for every American. I have done this by capping insulin and prescription drug costs, authoring the 21st Century Cures Act, championing the Affordable Care Act, and finding bipartisan solutions wherever possible. In this new role, I am committed to continuing these efforts and ensuring that quality health care is available to all. 

“I look forward to working with the Health Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Buddy Carter to find bipartisan solutions to our country’s health care issues. However, I will stand firm against extreme plans to gut essential programs like Medicare and Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.” 

Rep. DeGette has been a leader in health care throughout her time in Congress. Among other achievements, she helped establish the Special Diabetes Program and the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), and successfully advocated for stem cell research, the Affordable Care Act, and expanded access to health care for low-income Americans. Rep. DeGette also authored the 21st Century Cures Act, which revolutionized research and development in health care and has paved the way for novel cancer treatments, therapies to treat sickle cell disease, and more.

11:16:33 root         DEBUG    Desc: Washington, D.C. –  Congresswoman Ann Wagner (R-MO) released the following statement after Speaker of the House Mike Johnson named her to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence: 

Congresswoman Wagner said:  “I am honored the Speaker has entrusted me with this incredible responsibility. Our world is in a dangerous place right now, with our adversaries seeking to disrupt our nation’s stability and national security. The new axis of evil that is China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea threatens the safety of Americans worldwide and here at home. We must be vigilant and stand strong against their efforts to undermine our very way of life, and the House Intelligence Committee will be at the forefront of that fight.” 

Speaker Johnson said:  “I am honored to appoint Ann Wagner to serve on the House Intelligence Committee. Ann has been a relentless advocate for government transparency and accountability, a critically important skillset as Congress works to rebuild the American people’s trust in the intelligence community. Having served as a U.S. Ambassador and senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, she brings invaluable perspective and expertise to this role.” 

Congresswoman Wagner continued:  “This new role is an opportunity to be a key part of our nation’s global decision-making and address crises that will change the course of history. We have reached a fork in the road and must choose between being a strong America that fights for its citizens, or a passive nation due to President Biden’s weak policies that have emboldened dictators around the world. I look forward to working with Chairman Crawford and the members of the Committee to advance America’s strengths and interests. 

“As part of my commitment to supporting our nation’s national security, with this prestigious appointment, I will need to focus my efforts on the Intelligence Committee and my Chairmanship of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets. As such I will step aside from my position on the Foreign Affairs Committee, allowing for another qualified Republican Member to take my place.” 

Congresswoman Ann Wagner will continue her work as one of the founding co-chairs of the bipartisan and bicameral Abraham Accords Caucus, working to advance one of President Trump’s major achievements to normalize peace and prosperity in the Middle East. As part of that work, she will continue as a member of the Gaza Working Group, an initiative that promotes a stable and deradicalized Gaza. Congresswoman Wagner will also remain on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to help ensure our European partners take their obligations to NATO and global stability seriously.

11:16:36 root         DEBUG    Dates: 2025-01-16
11:16:36 root         DEBUG    Desc: WASHINGTON  — Congressman Jason Crow (D-CO-06), a former Army Ranger,  led a letter  with Reps. Espaillat (D-NY-13), Dean (D-PA-04) and 55 of his colleagues urging Speaker Mike Johnson to comply with a federal law requiring the placement of a plaque on the western front of the US Capitol to recognize the law enforcement officers who responded to the January 6, 2021, attack. 

In the letter Congressman Crow and his colleagues urge Speaker Johnson to fully comply with H.R. 2471, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022  , which mandates that a plaque be placed on the western front of the US Capitol honoring the service and sacrifice of the law enforcement officers who responded that day. The plaque was due to be placed by March 15, 2023, and despite the Acting Architect of the Capitol  testifying  (link is external)  to Congress last year that the plaque was complete, the placement of the plaque continues to await action from Speaker Johnson. 

The Members specifically highlight the toll of that terrible day, including several law enforcement officers dying following the attack and more than 140 assaulted during the course of the siege. The Members also emphasize the lingering effects of that day on many involved, with officers sustaining serious physical and mental injuries that prevented them from returning to service. 

“As Members of Congress, we owe a debt of gratitude to these brave officers who defended the Capitol and allowed us to get to safety. We request an update from you regarding your timeline for following the law and placing this plaque,”  the Members said in the letter. 

The Members continued:  “Every day Congress fails to live up to our promised actions, we do a disservice to our men and women in uniform who help protect Members of Congress, congressional staff, our constituents, and the American people.” 

As a member of the group who was trapped in the US House gallery as the attack unfolded, Congressman Crow has worked hard to ensure the lessons of January 6, 2021, are never forgotten. Congressman Crow recently  re-introduced  the Capitol Remembrance Act, legislation to establish an exhibit in the Capitol in honor of the brave law enforcement officers who were injured and killed in the attacks; he previously introduced this bill in the last two Congresses. 

A PDF of the letter can be found  here  , with full text appearing below: 

January 16, 2025 

Speaker Johnson: 

Every day, members of the U.S. Capitol Police work to ensure the safety and security of our nation’s Capitol complex, Members of Congress, congressional staff, and the millions of Americans who visit each year. 

On January 6, 2021, a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol. During the siege on the Capitol that day, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, over 140 police officers were assaulted, including over 80 from the U.S. Capitol Police and over 60 from the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Several law enforcement officers, including Brian Sicknick, Howard Liebengood, Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida, and Kyle DeFreytag, died following this attack. Many others sustained serious physical and mental injuries that prevented them from returning to service. 

The United States Congress recognized the sacrifices of these brave law enforcement officers in 2022 with the passage of a law to erect a plaque to honor members of law enforcement who responded to the January 6, 2021, attacks. Specifically, H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, states: 

“Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this bill, the Architect of the Capitol shall obtain an honorific plaque listing the names of all of the officers of the United States Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and protective entities who responded to the violence that occurred at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, and shall place the plaque at a permanent location on the western front of the United States Capitol.” 

This bill was signed into law by the President on March 15, 2022, and a plaque was due to be placed by March 15, 2023. However, as of today, this plaque has not yet been placed on the western front of the U.S. Capitol. This is despite the Acting Architect of the Capitol testifying to Congress last year that the plaque was complete. It is our understanding that this matter awaits action by you, as Speaker of the House, to place the plaque as directed by law. 

On January 31, 2024, a spokesperson for your office said you were “looking into the matter and determining a path forward.” Subsequently, on May 16, 2024, your spokesperson said that “your office was working with the Architect of the Capitol to get the plaque mounted.” 

We urge you to ensure this plaque to honor the brave law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6th will be placed without further delay. As Members of Congress, we owe a debt of gratitude to these brave officers who defended the Capitol and allowed us to get to safety. We request an update from you regarding your timeline for following the law and placing this plaque. 

Every day Congress fails to live up to our promised actions, we do a disservice to our men and women in uniform who help protect Members of Congress, congressional staff, our constituents, and the American people.

I’m proud to once again serve on the House Armed Services Committee to support Colorado’s military community and Buckley Space Force Base, improve the lives of our servicemembers and their families, and help keep America safe.”
