New Legislation Introduced to Enhance Safety Standards for Gates: The Alex Gate Safety Act of 2024

**Press Release:**  
Washington, D.C. – On November 26, 2024, Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced H.R. 10259, the Alex Gate Safety Act of 2024, aimed at improving safety standards for various types of gates to protect consumers from potential hazards. This legislation directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to establish a mandatory consumer product safety standard for covered gates, ensuring they meet rigorous safety criteria. 

“The introduction of the Alex Gate Safety Act marks a significant step in safeguarding families against dangerous incidents involving gates. By implementing these new standards, we aim to prevent accidents and enhance the safety of our communities,” said Congressman Huffman. The act mandates that the CPSC finalizes safety regulations within one year of its enactment and requires that covered gates comply with multiple safety standards, including ASTM and ANSI/CAN/UL requirements. The legislation outlines necessary features for these gates, such as positive stops to prevent unintended movements and ensuring that the gates maintain balance and do not fall under their own weight.

Furthermore, the bill recognizes the importance of consumer education by requiring the CPSC to launch a national awareness campaign focused on the dangers associated with detached or falling gates. “This campaign will not only provide essential information to consumers regarding safe practices but will also educate manufacturers on the latest standards in gate design and installation,” Huffman added.

Covered gates are defined in the act to include automatic and manual vehicular gates, as well as any gates exceeding specified dimensions. The legislation emphasizes a proactive approach: if standards are revised by recognized organizations, those updates will automatically be adopted unless the CPSC finds they do not improve safety.

The Alex Gate Safety Act is part of a broader effort to protect consumers from preventable injuries and fatalities associated with inadequate safety measures in everyday products. By ensuring enhanced gate safety through this new standard, the legislation aims to create a culture of safety in residential, commercial, and public spaces.

As the legislation moves forward in Congress, stakeholders and advocacy groups are encouraged to participate in discussions surrounding its potential impact. The CPSC will also be tasked with reporting back to Congress on the implementation of public education initiatives within three years of the law’s enactment.

**Headline:** U.S. Unemployment Insurance Claims Show Slight Decrease, but Insured Unemployment Rises in Latest Weekly Report

**Press Release:** 

The U.S. Department of Labor has released its Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims report, revealing key changes in the unemployment landscape. As of December 21, 2024, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims stands at 219,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week’s revised level of 220,000. This data suggests a modest decline in new claims, yet it also highlights concerns about rising insured unemployment levels. The four-week moving average for initial claims increased to 226,500, marking an uptick of 1,000 compared to 225,500 the week before.

While the total number of new claims has dipped slightly, the report indicates an increase in the insured unemployment rate. For the week ending December 14, the advance seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate rose to 1.3 percent, reflecting a 0.1 percentage point rise. Notably, the total number of seasonally adjusted insured unemployment claims increased to 1,910,000, climbing by 46,000 from the previous week and marking the highest level of insured unemployment since November 13, 2021. "These numbers illustrate an unsettling trend as the labor market faces continuing challenges," a Department of Labor spokesperson commented.

Unadjusted data shows a more pronounced increase in claims. The advance number of actual initial claims under state programs totaled 274,734 for the week ending December 21, a sharp increase of 22,663 claims or 9.0 percent from the previous week. The rise in initial claims matches the expectations set by seasonal factors, which had anticipated an increase of approximately 23,556 claims.

Additionally, the report highlights variations across states, with New York witnessing the most significant decrease in claims, dropping by 6,807 due to fewer layoffs across several sectors, including transportation and construction. Conversely, states like California and Texas also reported substantial declines of 5,279 and 5,405 claims, respectively.

The continual volatility in unemployment claims is being closely monitored as it serves as a leading indicator of economic conditions. The Department of Labor emphasized, "While weekly fluctuations are a common occurrence in the unemployment claims data, the increasing trend in insured unemployment warrants careful observation."

This data is critical for policymakers as it provides insights into the ongoing impacts of economic conditions on labor market dynamics and workers across the country. The next report will provide further clarity on this evolving situation as the economy navigates these fluctuations.
