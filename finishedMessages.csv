**Press Release:**

On November 26, 2024, Representative Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced the Alex Gate Safety Act of 2024, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing consumer safety standards for various types of gates. This crucial legislation mandates that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) establish a comprehensive set of safety regulations regarding ""covered gates,"" which include automatic vehicular gates, manual vehicular gates, and any gates exceeding 48 inches in width or 84 inches in height. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for review.

The introduction of the Alex Gate Safety Act comes in response to growing concerns over the safety of gates, particularly due to incidents involving detached or malfunctioning gates that pose significant risks to consumers. Under the new act, the CPSC will be required to finalize a consumer product safety standard within one year of enactment, incorporating specifications that align with current safety-related standards such as ASTM F900-24 and ANSI/CAN/UL 325. Key requirements for compliant gates include maintaining a vertical stability of no more than 45 degrees, providing positive stops, and ensuring balanced functionality to prevent movement under their own weight.

""H.R. 10259 represents a proactive step to ensure that the gates used across our communities are not only functional but also safe,"" said Rep. Huffman. ""By establishing enforceable standards and educating the public on safe practices, we can prevent serious injuries and save lives.""

In addition to the safety standards, the act requires the CPSC to undertake an extensive national education campaign within two years to improve public awareness about the dangers associated with covered gates. This campaign will target various stakeholders, from manufacturers to consumers, emphasizing best practices for gate design and installation.

Furthermore, a report summarizing the actions taken by the CPSC under this act will be submitted to Congress three years after enactment. This accountability measure aims to ensure continued vigilance regarding consumer safety in relation to covered gates.

The introduction of the Alex Gate Safety Act seeks to bridge safety gaps that currently exist and to foster a culture of proactive safety standards in consumer products, reinforcing Congress's commitment to protecting American families."

**Press Release:**

As a partial government shutdown looms, federal employees are left with uncertainty regarding their pay and benefits. On Friday, Congress has just hours to reach an agreement and pass a short-term funding measure before midnight, following disruptions in negotiations instigated by President-elect Trump and Elon Musk, which led to the rejection of a bipartisan deal earlier in the week. As Erich Wagner notes in Government Executive, ""lawmakers and the White House had less than 12 hours to"" avert a shutdown, with crucial components of the proposed legislation in flux.

If the government shuts down, federal workers will face a mix of consequences. According to guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), employees deemed essential will remain on duty without immediate pay, while furloughed employees will not receive pay during the shutdown. However, a law enacted in 2019 guarantees that ""they all will automatically be granted back pay to cover the shutdown once funding is restored."" This change marks a shift from past practices where back pay required individual legislative approval.

Further complicating the financial landscape, performance bonuses can be awarded during a shutdown, but payouts will be delayed until funding is reinstated. In a slight reprieve, paychecks for the Dec. 1-14 pay period will be issued on schedule, projected between Dec. 20 and 26. However, OPM has cautioned that subsequent paychecks associated with the Dec. 15-28 period may not include pay for furloughed workers. OPM's directives aim to ""minimize the impact on federal workers’ paychecks,” highlighting the complexity of the federal payroll process in times of crisis.

Furloughed federal employees will maintain health care coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, but premiums will accrue and be deducted from future paychecks. Annually scheduled retirement benefits will continue, but contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan will be paused during the shutdown.

Some additional adjustments have been made after the tumultuous 2018-2019 shutdown, including provisions that allow staffing HR departments during these periods. According to OPM, ""agency HR employees, who were previously furloughed during shutdowns, are deemed essential” for handling health benefits enrollments.

With lawmakers rushing to finalize a deal, federal employees are left to navigate the complexities of their pay and benefits amidst a potentially extended government shutdown. The outcome remains uncertain, and uncertainties abound as federal workers await clarity on their financial future."

**Press Release:**  
In a recent discussion about the incoming Trump administration's initiatives aimed at modernizing federal operations, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott expressed an invigorating shift in Washington regarding the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). With prominent figures like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk spearheading this advisory effort, McDermott noted a growing enthusiasm among lawmakers across the political spectrum. ""The mood in this town has changed. People are inspired and fired up,"" he remarked during his engagement with media representatives.

McDermott emphasized that the federal government requires a transformation akin to a best-in-class business — secure, efficient, cost-effective, and agile. The DOGE aims to tackle the longstanding issues plaguing federal IT, where an estimated $100 billion is spent annually on outdated systems that often lack interoperability. This inefficiency not only drains resources but inhibits the introduction of innovative technologies vital for government enhancement. As McDermott pointed out, ""Historically, as much as 80% of the federal government’s IT budget is spent on operating and maintaining legacy technology,” which severely restricts funds available for modern solutions.

The commitment to re-evaluating and potentially reducing government regulations, along with spending, is critical to improving efficiency. While some skepticism exists about the feasibility of such dramatic changes, McDermott is optimistic. He stated, ""In fact, we've made our inquiries and we're ready to help because we know their goal is to take $2 trillion in cost out but also to improve performance.” His remarks reflect a readiness from the tech community to engage deeply with the administration's efficiency goals.

Moreover, the conversation also veered towards anticipated workforce reductions. McDermott suggested that while natural attrition is expected, the focus remains on enhancing the productivity of the existing workforce through superior tools and support. “...you also have to give them the best tools. I think that’s a fair bargain,” he stated, underscoring the importance of equipping government employees with advanced technology to ensure optimal performance.

ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to facilitate these changes. The company has demonstrated exponential growth under McDermott's leadership, serving a burgeoning number of public sector customers. With plans to roll out its AI Agent technology in early 2025, the company aims to drive efficiency within government operations further. “We were made for this moment. This is our moment,"" McDermott concluded, reflecting a strong alignment between ServiceNow’s capabilities and the transformative ambitions of the DOGE initiative, echoing the sentiment that advancements in technology could significantly reshape government efficiency for the better."

**Press Release:**  
In a dramatic turn of events, President Joe Biden signed a temporary funding bill late Saturday night, successfully averting a federal government shutdown just minutes before the midnight deadline. With bipartisan support, Congress approved the funding measure that keeps federal agencies operational until November 17, 2023. The urgent necessity of this legislation arose after tumultuous negotiations that threatened to disrupt services for millions of Americans, including federal workers and military personnel.

“This is good news for the American people,” President Biden stated, emphasizing the importance of cohesion in Congress during uncertain times. The legislation, however, included a significant concession—omitting the aid package for Ukraine that the White House had previously deemed a top priority. Instead, the bill increased federal disaster assistance by $16 billion to meet Biden’s requests. Addressing the exclusion, President Biden affirmed, “We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” urging Congress to reconsider this crucial assistance in the near future.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, facing pressure from a hard-right faction within his party, ultimately relied on Democratic votes to ensure passage of the bill. “We’re going to do our job,” he declared, resolving to prioritize government continuity despite risks to his leadership position. The funding bill passed the House with a vote of 335-91, with most Republicans and nearly all Democrats in support. The Senate followed suit, within minutes, passing the bill by an 88-9 margin.

Despite this temporary reprieve, the situation remains precarious, with looming deadlines and potential crises ahead. The nation now faces questions about future appropriations as hardline Republicans signal increased opposition to bipartisan agreements. “It has been a day full of twists and turns,” remarked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, reaffirming the need for stability in governmental operations. The fears of a government shutdown had far-reaching implications, from furloughs of federal workers to disruptions in vital public services, such as food assistance programs and military pay.

As Congress will revisit funding matters soon, continued bipartisan negotiations will be necessary to maintain government operations without interruption. The outcome of this latest legislative action highlights the ongoing tensions within Congress but also presents an opportunity for collaboration to address the critical needs of the nation. As the urgency of governing continues, the focus will remain on ensuring both the fiscal responsibility outlined by conservative factions and the humanitarian aid commitments underscored by more moderate lawmakers."

**Press Release:** 

As of January 23, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor reports a minor increase in initial unemployment claims, reflecting ongoing fluctuations in the job market. For the week ending January 18, seasonally adjusted initial claims rose to 223,000, marking a rise of 6,000 from the prior week's figure of 217,000. The four-week moving average, which smooths out anomalies to reveal broader trends, also rose slightly to 213,500, an increase of 750 from the previous week's average of 212,750, indicating a modest uptick in unemployment claims.

Additionally, for the week ending January 11, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted insured unemployment experienced a slight increase, reaching 1.899 million. This represents an increase of 46,000 from the previous month's revised level and highlights the highest insured unemployment level seen since November 2021. “The unchanged insured unemployment rate of 1.2 percent suggests that although initial claims have seen an uptick, the overall rate remains stable,” stated a DOL spokesperson. 

Unadjusted data reflect a contrasting trend; the advance number of actual initial claims under state programs saw a notable decrease, totaling 284,222, which amounts to a dramatic drop of 68,135 claims, or 19.3 percent, since last week. This figures significantly offsets the seasonal prediction of a decrease of 75,722 claims. 

State-level analyses reveal that Michigan experienced the most substantial rise in claims, with an increase of 14,985, attributed primarily to layoffs in the manufacturing sector. Similarly, California (up by 12,731) and Texas (up by 11,439) saw significant claims from the health care and social assistance industries. In contrast, New York recorded a significant decline of 15,396 claims as fewer job losses were reported in transportation, warehousing, and the construction industry.

As the Department works to mitigate unemployment challenges, the continued claims for unemployment benefits across all programs also rose, totaling 2.301 million for the week ending January 4, an increase of 87,908 from the previous week. “This rise in continued claims indicates that some individuals are finding it challenging to re-enter the workforce,” cautioned the spokesperson.

The Department of Labor remains committed to monitoring unemployment trends and supporting individuals impacted by job loss, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to bolster employment opportunities. Further information is available on the DOL website at [blog.dol.gov](https://blog.dol.gov)."
