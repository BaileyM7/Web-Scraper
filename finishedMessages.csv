Morgan Griffith of Virginia has introduced the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (H.R. 27) aimed at combating the ongoing fentanyl crisis in the United States. This legislation proposes significant amendments to the Controlled Substances Act, specifically targeting the scheduling of fentanyl-related substances. By expanding the legal definition of these substances, the act seeks to more effectively regulate the production, distribution, and use of fentanyl analogues, which are often linked to overdoses and illegal trafficking.  The HALT Fentanyl Act mandates that any substance structurally related to fentanyl be classified under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act unless specifically exempted. This classification invokes stricter control measures for those involved in handling these substances, facilitating more robust enforcement against trafficking. Additionally, the bill aims to streamline the registration process for researchers studying controlled substances, ensuring that necessary investigations can continue without unnecessary delays, while maintaining strict regulatory oversight.  The introduction of this bill comes in response to rising concerns over the prevalence of fentanyl and its analogues contributing to the opioid crisis. Griffith's proposal is backed by a number of prominent co-sponsors and has been referred to both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee for further consideration. As the bill moves forward, it aims to enhance the federal government's ability to confront the dangers posed by synthetic opioids and reinforce public health initiatives intended to mitigate this deadly epidemic.
