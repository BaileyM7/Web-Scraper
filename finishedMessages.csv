Morgan Griffith [R-VA] has announced the introduction of the HALT Fentanyl Act, H.R.27, aimed at tackling the escalating crisis of fentanyl-related substance abuse. The bill seeks to amend the Controlled Substances Act by adding fentanyl-related substances to the list of Schedule I drugs, thereby imposing stricter controls regarding their manufacture, distribution, and research.

The HALT Fentanyl Act reflects growing concerns over the rising number of deaths attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Often mixed with other illicit drugs, fentanyl is significantly more potent than morphine and continues to be a leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States. By updating the scheduling regulations, the legislation intends to close gaps that currently exist in the enforcement of drug trafficking laws and to provide law enforcement agencies with better tools to combat the illicit trade of these dangerous substances.

In addition to stricter scheduling, the bill proposes updated registration protocols for researchers working with controlled substances. It aims to streamline procedures and ensure that scientific research involving fentanyl and its analogs can proceed without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles while still maintaining stringent safety measures.

In a broader context, the legislation aligns with ongoing efforts by lawmakers and health officials to implement comprehensive strategies to address the opioid crisis, which has seen a drastic increase in addiction and overdose fatalities in recent years.While the bill awaits review from the Senate Judiciary Committee, it possesses the potential to reshape drug policy and enhance public health responses to a crisis that has devastated communities across the nation."

Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced a new bill aimed at modifying regulations that affect nonprofit organizations when they engage with federal officials. The proposed Freedom to Petition the Government Act seeks to classify meetings held by these organizations at federal government-owned or leased venues in Washington, D.C. as non-commercial activities, exempting them from registering as entities conducting business in the District.

The bill addresses ongoing concerns that existing regulations can inhibit the ability of nonprofits to engage openly with government representatives. By clarifying that meetings with Congress members or federal officials in government-owned spaces do not count as doing business, the legislation intends to enhance transparency and facilitate more opportunities for dialogue between nonprofits and the government, fostering greater civic engagement.

In its current form, the measure amends Section 29–105.05(a) of the District of Columbia Official Code. It includes provisions specifically addressing entities that fall under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, ensuring they can pursue advocacy efforts without the burden of unnecessary regulatory hurdles. Proponents of the bill believe that easing these restrictions will result in more productive communication and collaboration between nonprofit organizations and the federal government.

The Freedom to Petition the Government Act has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will undergo review and discussion among committee members. The introduction of this bill underscores Representative Biggs' commitment to supporting the interests of nonprofit organizations and ensuring their voices are heard in the policymaking process."

Biggs (R-AZ) has introduced H.R. 92, known as the Strategic Production Response and Implementation Act, aimed at enhancing domestic oil and gas production. The bill mandates the creation of a plan to increase oil and gas production on federal lands while allowing for the drawdown of petroleum reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Energy and relevant authorities must devise a strategy that correlates the percentage increase of oil and gas production leases on federal lands to the percentage of petroleum being drawn from the SPR. Specifically, the bill stipulates that there can be no drawdown of petroleum from the reserve until such a plan is in place, ensuring that the increase in production does not exceed 10 percent of the total leased federal lands.

The act specifically involves collaboration among the Secretaries of Agriculture, Energy, Interior, and Defense to ensure a comprehensive approach to managing resources and increasing production capabilities. It emphasizes federal jurisdiction, including submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf, placing focus on comprehensive planning before engaging in reserve drawdowns.

This initiative reflects efforts to bolster energy independence and manage fluctuating energy supplies amid increasing domestic energy demands. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it will undergo review and further deliberation. Supporters highlight the importance of balancing energy production with resource management as the nation navigates the complexities of energy security and environmental considerations. As Congress continues to address issues of economic stability and energy reliability, this legislation proposes practical measures that could enhance the nation’s energy future."
