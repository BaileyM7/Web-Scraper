WASHINGTON, March 8 -- Rep. Stacey Plaskett, D-VI, has introduced the Territorial Tax Parity Act of 2025, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to promote economic recovery in U.S. territories. The legislation seeks to modify existing residence and source rules specifically for the U.S. possessions to foster business growth and financial stability in these areas.

This bill arises from ongoing concerns about the economic challenges facing American territories. By revising tax regulations, the act aims to create a more equitable tax environment that encourages investment and economic activity. The proposed changes would allow for more favorable tax treatment of income earned in these regions, potentially boosting local businesses and attracting external investment.

The impact of this legislation could be significant. By making the tax landscape more favorable, the bill hopes to stimulate job creation and enhance economic opportunities in the Virgin Islands and other U.S. territories, which have historically faced higher rates of poverty and unemployment compared to the mainland. The economic revival of these regions would not only benefit residents but also contribute to the overall economic health of the nation.

Furthermore, this initiative reflects a broader commitment from Congress to address the disparities faced by U.S. territories. By providing targeted support, the federal government acknowledges the unique challenges these regions encounter while striving for economic equality within the United States.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it will be reviewed and potentially modified before being presented for a vote. As awareness grows around the economic issues in U.S. territories, advocates hope that the Territorial Tax Parity Act will gain the support necessary to advance through Congress.

The bill (H.R. 365) was introduced on 01/13/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 8 -- Rep. Stacey E. Plaskett, D-VI, has introduced a new bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to ensure that revenue from taxes on fuel produced in the Virgin Islands is allocated directly to the territory’s treasury. The proposed legislation seeks to bolster the local economy by enhancing financial resources through direct tax revenue sharing.

Plaskett’s initiative stems from a pressing need to improve the economic stability of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which has faced significant financial challenges. By directing tax revenues from fuel produced on the islands, the bill aims to provide the Virgin Islands with a critical funding source that is currently diverted elsewhere. This shift is expected to have a positive impact on local infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Under the bill, all taxes collected on fuel imported from the Virgin Islands into the United States will be covered into the territory's treasury. This measure is particularly essential given the islands' reliance on fuel production and sales for economic sustenance. By enhancing local access to these funds, the legislation also promotes self-sufficiency and growth.

The bill reflects a broader ongoing effort to address long-standing economic disparities faced by the Virgin Islands. In recent years, local leaders have continuously highlighted the restrictions imposed by the federal tax system, which complicates economic development within U.S. territories. This proposed adjustment not only supports local enterprise but also signifies a critical step toward equitable resource distribution.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will undergo evaluation by the House Committee on Ways and Means. Stakeholders from the Virgin Islands anticipate a favorable outcome, believing that this legislation will lay the groundwork for long-term financial health and innovation in the region.

The bill (H.R. 366) was introduced on 01/13/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 8 -- Rep. Stacey E. Plaskett, D-VI, has introduced the Territorial Tax Parity and Clarification Act, aimed at updating the Internal Revenue Code to reflect changes in tax source rules for property sales within U.S. territories. This legislation seeks to eliminate discrepancies in how taxes are applied to transactions involving personal property in territories such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The bill was prompted by concerns from small businesses and residents in U.S. territories who have experienced challenges due to outdated tax regulations. Current laws treat businesses operating in these jurisdictions differently from those in the mainland United States, potentially discouraging economic activity and investment. By modifying source rules, the act aims to create a more equitable tax environment, encouraging growth and enhancing fiscal stability in these territories.

If passed, this legislation could have significant implications for tax compliance and business operations in U.S. territories. It is anticipated to streamline the tax obligations of businesses, making it easier for them to navigate the complexities of the tax code. The updated rules would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023, giving businesses time to adjust to the new standards.

This act is particularly relevant for lawmakers who advocate for equal treatment of territorial economies, which often face unique challenges. As Congress deliberates the proposed changes, stakeholders from various sectors, including local government, business owners, and tax professionals, may actively engage in discussions about the anticipated benefits and potential drawbacks of the bill.

The Territorial Tax Parity and Clarification Act represents a critical step toward modernizing tax policy for U.S. territories, fostering a more inclusive economic environment. Rep. Plaskett’s initiative underscores the importance of ensuring that all U.S. regions are afforded equitable treatment under federal tax regulations.

The bill (H.R. 367) was introduced on 01/13/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 8 -- Rep. Stacey E. Plaskett, D-VI, has introduced the Territorial Tax Parity and Fairness Act, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to change tax treatment for certain residents of the Virgin Islands. This bill seeks to alleviate the tax burden on bona fide residents who are shareholders of Virgin Islands corporations, allowing them not to be classified as United States persons for specific income tax purposes.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions surrounding tax equity and the unique economic circumstances faced by residents of U.S. territories. Currently, U.S. tax laws create disparities that disproportionately affect Virgin Islands residents, particularly regarding income derived from local corporate entities. Rep. Plaskett’s legislation seeks to rectify this by ensuring that residents receiving dividends from these corporations are recognized for tax purposes in a way that is fairer and more representative of their local contributions.

If passed, the act could significantly impact the local economy, encouraging investment and stability within Virgin Islands businesses. Enhanced tax fairness is expected to promote growth, allowing local entrepreneurs and shareholders to reinvest in their communities without the excessive burden of U.S. taxation on income that is already subject to local taxation.

Rep. Plaskett’s bill, introduced on January 13, 2025, has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. The legislation reflects a broader legislative effort to address taxation and economic challenges faced by U.S. territories, highlighting the importance of equitable treatment in federal tax laws.

The bill (H.R. 368) was introduced on 01/13/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 8 -- Rep. David Rouzer, R-NC, has introduced the States’ Education Reclamation Act of 2025, a bill aimed at abolishing the U.S. Department of Education and returning educational governance to individual states. The proposal advocates for a federalist approach to education, emphasizing state and local control over student learning and educational policies. 

The bill responds to criticisms that the federal government’s influence has led to bloated bureaucracies and inadequate educational performance among American students. Supporters argue that local control will empower parents and educators, enabling them to make decisions tailored to their communities' unique needs. They envision a system that enhances the educational landscape and fosters innovation, allowing states the freedom to allocate funds effectively and directly influence local curricula.

If enacted, the bill would not only eradicate the Department of Education but also reallocate funds to states for both elementary and secondary education programs, as well as postsecondary education, through grants. Rouzer's legislation seeks to simplify educational funding, creating a framework that encourages states to use federal grants to supplement their education budgets rather than supplant them.

Historically, the U.S. education system has become increasingly centralized since the creation of the Department of Education in 1979, which now administers nearly 100 programs with a budget of approximately $73.5 billion. Despite this substantial investment, standardized test scores for American students have remained stagnant. Critics of the Department cite overregulation and bureaucratic inefficiencies as detrimental to educational outcomes.

The States’ Education Reclamation Act, introduced to the House of Representatives and referred to the Education and Workforce Committee, signals a significant shift in U.S. educational policy aimed at restoring state authority and potentially transforming the educational landscape for American students.

The bill (H.R. 369) introduced on 01/13/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Edwards, Chuck [R-NC-11] [02/05/2025]; Rep. Harris, Andy [R-MD-1] [03/06/2025].
