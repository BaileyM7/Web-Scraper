WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the No Mandates Act, aimed at prohibiting any COVID-19 vaccination mandates imposed by federal agencies. The bill seeks to eliminate rules or guidance requiring COVID-19 vaccines as a condition for access to federal properties and services.

This legislation comes in response to ongoing debates surrounding vaccine mandates that have emerged during the pandemic. Proponents of the No Mandates Act argue that it is essential to protect individual freedoms and ensure that citizens are not compelled to receive vaccinations against their will. By curtailing mandates, the bill aims to provide a sense of autonomy to those who remain hesitant or opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine.

The implications of this bill are significant. If passed, it would prevent government agencies from implementing vaccination requirements and restrict any entity receiving federal funds related to COVID-19 relief from requiring proof of vaccination as a service condition. Such entities would face severe penalties, including the potential return of funds received under various COVID-19 aid packages.

The No Mandates Act underscores a broader conversation regarding public health policy and personal liberty. As the nation continues to navigate the pandemic's impact, opinions regarding vaccination requirements remain deeply polarized. This legislation illustrates a clear stance among some legislators in favor of limiting governmental power in health-related mandates.

The bill has been referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as the Committees on House Administration and Energy and Commerce, where it will undergo further consideration. The outcome of this proposal could set a precedent for how federal health policies are implemented in the future.

The bill (H.R. 120) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No Vaccine Passports Act to prohibit federal agencies from issuing vaccine passports or sharing COVID-19 vaccination records of U.S. citizens with third parties. This move seeks to address growing concerns over privacy and government overreach in the wake of increasing vaccination mandates.

The bill comes as many Americans voice their apprehensions about the implications of a national vaccine registry. Proponents of the act argue that it safeguards individual rights by preventing the federal government from requiring proof of vaccination for access to federal services and properties. Rep. Biggs emphasizes that personal health information should remain confidential and that citizens should not be compelled to disclose their vaccination status to access public facilities.

The proposed legislation reflects a broader sentiment among certain segments of the population who fear the potential for discrimination based on vaccination status. Many believe that vaccine passports could lead to a divided society, where unvaccinated individuals might be barred from various activities or services. By introducing this bill, Rep. Biggs aims to eliminate the possibility of coercive measures forcing individuals to comply with vaccination mandates.

The bill will be reviewed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Administration Committee. As discussions around public health policies continue, the outcome of this legislation could significantly impact the ongoing national dialogue regarding personal freedom, health privacy, and government regulations. If passed, it would mark a substantial shift in the approach to vaccination records and individual health information in the context of government operations.

The bill (H.R. 121) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Al Green, D-TX, has introduced the Original Living American Wage Act, aimed at reforming the federal minimum wage to ensure it meets the needs of American families better. The proposed legislation seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act, aligning minimum wage rates with the Federal supplemental poverty threshold for renting families of four, specifically those with two children under 18. 

The need for this bill arises from a growing concern over poverty levels across the country, where approximately 37.9 million Americans live in conditions of financial struggle. The current federal minimum wage fails to provide an adequate income that keeps workers above the poverty line, particularly in relation to housing expenses. As housing costs continue to increase, many full-time workers earning minimum wage find themselves unable to secure affordable living situations. 

Should the Original LAW Act pass, the minimum wage would incrementally rise to $26.59 per hour by 2030, reflecting an effort to allow workers to achieve a living wage that meets overall economic demands. The legislation proposes automatic adjustments to the minimum wage in response to inflation, ensuring that wages remain relevant to real-world costs of living.

This bill highlights a significant shift in legislative priorities toward supporting low-income families, emphasizing that two minimum wage earners should be able to afford basic housing without exceeding standard affordability thresholds. The intent is to strengthen economic stability for millions of Americans while uplifting general living conditions and reducing poverty rates effectively. 

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where it will undergo evaluation before a potential vote.

The bill (H.R. 122) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing the scientific rigor of toxicity assessments conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This bill directs the EPA to conduct certain assessments through its program offices, ensuring a more coordinated and scientifically valid approach to evaluating chemical safety.

The bill comes in response to growing concerns about the reliability and transparency of chemical assessments that impact public health and the environment. By directing that assessments be managed by relevant program offices like the Offices of Water and Air and Radiation, the legislation seeks to utilize specialized expertise within the EPA, enhancing the accuracy of the findings. With increasing scrutiny on chemical safety due to various environmental issues, the bill aims to establish clearer standards and procedures for evaluating chemical toxicity and risks.

The potential impact of the Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act is significant. It not only promises to improve the quality of scientific assessments but also ensures that results are broadly based on the best available evidence. As the bill stipulates, any toxicity values assigned must be accompanied by a range of estimates regarding risk, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of chemical hazards.

Additionally, the legislation emphasizes the importance of updating a central database of chemical assessments to reflect new findings and methodologies. This database will be vital for transparency and for informing regulatory decisions, drawing attention to how the EPA approaches its chemical assessments going forward.

The Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act will now be reviewed by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, as well as the Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it will be examined and potentially modified before any further action is taken.

The bill (H.R. 123) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Limiting Emergency Powers Act of 2025, aiming to amend the National Emergencies Act. The bill seeks to terminate any national emergency declared by the President after 30 days unless a joint resolution affirming the declaration is enacted into law.

This legislation was introduced in response to growing concerns about the expansive power granted to the executive branch during national emergencies. Supporters argue that such power can be misused, bypassing essential checks and balances in governance. By limiting emergency declarations to a 30-day period without Congressional approval, the bill intends to encourage legislative oversight and ensure that emergency measures are not extended indefinitely without proper justification.

The potential impact of this bill could reshape how emergencies are managed in the United States. If enacted, it would compel future administrations to present their cases for ongoing emergencies to Congress, fostering accountability. Additionally, it could lead to a reexamination of current national emergency declarations, some of which have persisted for years without active Congressional review.

Should the Limiting Emergency Powers Act succeed, it would mark a significant shift in the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches, reflecting a heightened desire among lawmakers to regain authority in emergency situations. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure, Foreign Affairs, and Rules for further consideration.

As a volatile political environment continues to raise questions about governance and authority, Rep. Biggs' proposal enhances the dialogue surrounding emergency powers and their implications for democracy in the United States.

The bill (H.R. 125) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, has introduced the Original Students Voicing Opinions in Today’s Elections (VOTE) Act, aimed at empowering high school seniors with crucial voter registration information as they approach graduation. The bill proposes a pilot program managed by the Election Assistance Commission to fund local educational agencies for initiatives that inform students about registering to vote in upcoming elections.

This legislation comes in response to ongoing concerns about youth voter participation, which has historically been lower than other age demographics. By targeting high school seniors, the VOTE Act seeks to foster civic engagement and ensure that young voters are adequately prepared to participate in the democratic process. The bill encourages educational institutions to collaborate with local election officials, creating a network of support to facilitate students' understanding and access to voter registration.

Through this initiative, Rep. Green hopes to increase awareness among young citizens regarding their electoral rights and responsibilities. The program will not only provide information on how to register but also emphasize the significance of youth participation in shaping future policies and governance.

If passed, the VOTE Act would allocate funding for these programs during the fiscal year 2025, which advocates argue could significantly impact voter turnout in future elections as more young people become informed citizens. This pilot program is part of a larger trend in legislative efforts aimed at enhancing electoral engagement among underrepresented groups. By providing necessary resources and guidance, the VOTE Act aspires to create a more informed electorate poised to take an active role in their communities and government.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-CO, has introduced the Abolish the ATF Act, aimed at eliminating the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The bill marks a significant political move amidst ongoing debates surrounding gun control and federal regulatory powers.

The introduction of this bill reflects growing discontent among certain lawmakers and constituents over the ATF’s role in enforcing federal firearm regulations and investigating related crimes. Critics argue that the agency's regulatory actions infringe on constitutional rights, particularly the Second Amendment. The bill seeks to dissolve the ATF entirely, prompting discussions on how to reorganize responsibilities related to firearms, tobacco, and explosives enforcement.

Supporters view this bill as a necessary step to limit federal overreach, while opponents express concern over the potential rise in unregulated gun activity. The dissolution of the ATF could lead to a vacuum in federal oversight, raising questions on how such areas will be managed in the absence of the agency.

Historically, the ATF has been pivotal in regulating various aspects of gun control, taxing and managing gun dealers, and combating illegal trafficking. Its operations and enforcement actions have often drawn both praise and ire from diverse segments of the public and lawmakers. As this bill progresses, it may set the stage for broader discussions about the future of gun laws and federal regulation of firearms in the United States.

Boebert's legislation has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration, where it may face scrutiny and revisions. This initiative represents a critical juncture in the evolving landscape of American gun policy.

The bill (H.R. 129) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-CO, has introduced the Trust the Science Act, aiming to expedite the removal of the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List. This legislation calls for the Secretary of the Interior to reissue regulations within 60 days that would formally delist the species, which has been a contentious subject of debate among conservationists, ranchers, and policymakers.

The Trust the Science Act underscores the ongoing disputes surrounding wildlife management and conservation strategies. Proponents argue that the gray wolf population has rebounded enough to sustain a healthy ecosystem balance, while opponents claim that delisting could threaten vulnerable livestock and local ecosystems. This legislative move is seen not only as a push against what some perceive as excessive government regulation but also as an appeal to the idea that wildlife management should be driven by scientific assessments rather than emotional arguments.

The legislation also includes a stipulation that prohibits judicial review of the reissuance process, which is expected to spark further discussions regarding the balance of power between federal agencies and the judicial system in wildlife management cases. As the gray wolf narrative continues to unfold, this bill adds an additional layer to the conversation, highlighting a conflict between agricultural interests and wildlife conservation concerns.

The Trust the Science Act comes at a pivotal time when discussions surrounding species management highlight the evolving interfaces between agriculture, ecology, and law. If passed, the bill could have profound implications for Delaware's wildlife policies and management practices. Boebert's introduction of this legislation, which has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, sets the stage for heated debates as stakeholders on all sides prepare to voice their opinions.

WASHINGTON, March 04 -- Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-CO, has introduced the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act aimed at amending repayment terms for the Arkansas Valley Conduit project in Colorado. The bill seeks to simplify financial obligations by eliminating interest on payments, making it easier for involved parties to contribute towards the conduit’s completion.

The Arkansas Valley Conduit is a significant water infrastructure project intended to supply clean water to communities in eastern Colorado. However, financial hurdles have hindered its progress. By adjusting the repayment model, the new legislation is designed to facilitate swift completion of the project, ultimately benefiting local residents who have been waiting for reliable water access.

This initiative is rooted in ongoing concerns over water scarcity in the region, where droughts have intensified over recent years. The conduit, once fully operational, will serve as a crucial water supply source for affected areas, addressing public health and agricultural needs. Rep. Boebert's bill aims to leverage local support and funding, hoping to enhance community engagement and investment in the conduit’s future.

The proposed changes reflect broader discussions around water management and infrastructure funding across the Western United States, emphasizing efficient approaches to ongoing water crises. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Natural Resources, it will encounter scrutiny and debates regarding its feasibility and economic implications. 

If passed, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act could serve as a pilot program for other water initiatives nationwide, reinforcing the principle that effective legislative measures can pave the way for vital infrastructure improvements.
