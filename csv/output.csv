WASHINGTON, March 6 -- Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-MD, has introduced the Handgun Permit to Purchase Act, a legislative initiative aimed at creating a grant program to support state and local handgun licensing requirements. This bill seeks to address the rising rates of gun violence, highlighted by alarming statistics from 2023, where gun-related incidents resulted in 46,728 deaths.

The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act was introduced against the backdrop of increasing firearm violence in the United States, where studies indicate that nearly 90% of firearm-related homicides involve handguns. In response, the bill proposes a competitive grant program to aid states, local governments, and tribal authorities in developing and implementing robust handgun purchaser licensing laws. The program aims to enhance public safety by ensuring that handgun buyers undergo thorough background checks and meet specific eligibility criteria.

Research supports the effectiveness of handgun licensing laws in reducing gun violence, with states like Connecticut and Maryland demonstrating significant declines in homicide rates following the implementation of such regulations. The bill builds upon existing evidence that suggests stringent licensing can curb the illegal acquisition of firearms and mitigate their diversion for criminal use. 

The grant program authorized by this legislation will also underscore the importance of compliance with licensing laws, especially in states struggling to enact similar measures. With the federal government providing necessary resources for enforcement and implementation, the Handgun Permit to Purchase Act aims to create an environment of accountability and protection, ultimately contributing to the reduction of firearm-related deaths across the nation.

The bill (S. 123) introduced on 01/16/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Sen. Blumenthal, Richard [D-CT] 01/16/2025; Sen. Murphy, Christopher [D-CT] 01/16/2025.
