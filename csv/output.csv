WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Mike Ezell, R-MS, has introduced the Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act, aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in the distribution of federal disaster assistance. This legislation seeks to establish an online repository that will publicly document the flow and utilization of federal funds allocated for disaster recovery.

The impetus for this bill arises from a growing need for accountability associated with federal disaster aid, especially following natural disasters. Past events have often highlighted discrepancies and concerns regarding how funds are allocated and spent. By mandating federal agencies to publish detailed reports on disaster assistance, the act aims to improve public trust and ensure that relief efforts are effectively administered.

Under the proposed legislation, covered federal agencies will be required to create a subpage within an existing federal website dedicated to transparency. This platform will make data machine-readable and include critical information such as the total amount of assistance provided, project details, and the status of funding allocations. By collecting this data quarterly, the bill aims to make it easier for citizens and oversight bodies to track how disaster funds are utilized across the nation.

The act encompasses aid from various agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA). It seeks to streamline the reporting process while ensuring that aid recipients, including states and municipalities, are accountable for how they utilize federal funds during recovery efforts.

As the bill progresses, it demonstrates a legislative effort to foster greater transparency in disaster management, aiming to bolster public confidence in the governmental response to emergencies.

The bill (H.R. 153) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Resident Commissioner Hernández, Pablo [D-PR-At Large]...01/13/2025; Del. Plaskett, Stacey E. [D-VI]...01/13/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Val T. Hoyle, D-OR, has introduced the POWER Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing federal assistance for hazard mitigation related to electric utilities. This legislation seeks to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, allowing for more integrated disaster recovery efforts and supporting the resilience of the nation's electric grid.

The introduction of the POWER Act comes amidst increasing concerns over climate change and natural disasters that disrupt power supply across the country. The bill specifically permits electric utilities to conduct hazard mitigation activities in conjunction with power restoration efforts, ensuring a more comprehensive approach to emergency management. By allowing these activities to be eligible for federal funding, the act aims to create a more resilient electrical infrastructure that can withstand adverse events better.

As climate-related disasters become more frequent, enhancing the resilience of the power grid is crucial for public safety and economic stability. The bill is poised to have broad implications across the energy sector, as it encourages electric utilities to adopt proactive measures against hazards. By integrating hazard mitigation strategies into regular operations, the POWER Act seeks to minimize future disruptions and reduce the financial burden on affected communities during emergencies.

This legislative effort aligns with a growing recognition among lawmakers of the need for enhanced disaster preparedness and response capabilities. If passed, the POWER Act could set a precedent for similar legislation, emphasizing the importance of rigorous hazard mitigation efforts in the face of escalating climate risks. With the bill now in the Senate for consideration, attention turns to discussions on its potential impacts and the broader commitment to climate resilience initiatives.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-NY, recently introduced the High Rise Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act, aimed at enhancing safety in high-rise buildings by incentivizing the installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems. The proposed legislation seeks to classify the retrofitting costs of these systems as 15-year depreciation property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, facilitating tax breaks for property owners.

The bill's introduction comes in response to growing concerns regarding fire safety in multi-story buildings. With numerous incidents highlighting the dangers of inadequate fire suppression systems, this legislation emphasizes the necessity of modernizing existing structures. By providing a financial incentive for upgrading safety measures, the act encourages property owners to invest in essential fire prevention systems.

Should the bill pass, it could significantly impact building safety standards across the nation. Fire safety advocates believe that improved sprinklers can greatly reduce the risk of fire-related injuries and fatalities during emergencies. The modified tax treatment is expected to ease the cost burden on property owners, promoting a safer living environment for residents in taller buildings.

Malliotakis’s legislation is not just timely; it aligns with a broader push towards enhancing public safety measures within growing urban areas. As cities expand vertically, ensuring the protection of residents from potential fire hazards has become paramount. The act could also stimulate economic activity by creating opportunities for local businesses specializing in fire safety systems and installation.

As the High Rise Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act moves through the legislative process, its success may hinge on garnering sufficient bipartisan support, especially as public safety continues to be a critical issue for constituents nationwide.

The bill (H.R. 173) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Landsman, Greg [D-OH-1]...03/04/2025; Rep. Larson, John B. [D-CT-1]...03/10/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, has introduced the Default Prevention Act, a legislative proposal aimed at ensuring the United States meets its debt obligations in a timely manner. The bill mandates the payment of principal and interest on federal debt by prioritizing different tiers of obligations in times of financial constraint.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing debates surrounding the national debt limit and concerns over potential defaults as the debt ceiling approaches. By establishing a structured priority system for debt repayments, the Default Prevention Act seeks to safeguard against the adverse effects that a government default could have on the economy and public trust in government financial management.

Should the bill be enacted, it would require the Secretary of the Treasury to categorize obligations into five tiers, with Tier I encompassing critical payments such as those to federal trust funds and Medicare, followed by obligations related to defense and veteran’s affairs in subsequent tiers. The proposed law emphasizes transparency by requiring weekly reports on payments made and obligations outstanding, thereby ensuring accountability in how the government's debt is managed.

By laying out this framework, the Default Prevention Act aims to provide clarity and predictability for financial markets and the public, potentially averting the crisis scenarios witnessed during previous debt ceiling standoffs. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

In this context, the legislation reflects broader fiscal responsibility goals, addressing the challenges posed by increasing national debt levels and the critical need for effective debt management strategies moving forward.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-NY, has introduced the Landlord Accountability Act aimed at amending the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination against tenants using Section 8 housing vouchers and other forms of rental assistance. The bill seeks to enhance protections for low-income renters by ensuring equitable treatment in housing opportunities.

The Landlord Accountability Act comes in response to ongoing concerns about housing discrimination, particularly affecting low-income families reliant on federal assistance programs. This legislation aims to close loopholes that allow landlords to refuse housing based on tenants’ sources of income, which has been a persistent issue in many communities. By broadening the definition of source of income within the Fair Housing Act, the bill includes various forms of federal, state, and local assistance, thus providing more comprehensive protections for families using such vouchers.

The potential impact of this bill is substantial, as it seeks to increase housing availability for low-income families and curb discriminatory practices that limit their housing options. By facilitating access to housing, it aims to alleviate some of the financial burdens faced by marginalized communities, ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to secure stable living conditions.

Furthermore, the bill proposes civil penalties for landlords who intentionally leave qualifying units vacant or fail to maintain them to acceptable standards for federal assistance. This measure is designed to promote responsible property management while ensuring that low-income families have practical access to housing resources.

The Landlord Accountability Act has been referred to several committees, including Financial Services and Judiciary, for further consideration as lawmakers assess its provisions and potential enforcement mechanisms.

The bill (H.R. 206) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Jack Bergman, R-MI, has introduced the Firearm Industry Non-Discrimination Act, known as the FIND Act, aimed at prohibiting the federal government from contracting with entities that discriminate against the firearm and ammunition industry. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, seeks to ensure that businesses in this sector are not unfairly disadvantaged by federal procurement practices.

The FIND Act arises from ongoing concerns among industry advocates regarding perceived bias against firearm-related businesses by certain financial institutions and service providers. The legislation would mandate that federal contracts include clauses certifying contractors’ non-discrimination policies against firearm entities, thereby reinforcing fair treatment across the procurement process. 

If passed, this bill could have far-reaching implications for vendors and contractors seeking business with federal agencies. The legislation emphasizes accountability, stipulating that prime contractors must refrain from sub-contracting with entities that fail to comply with these non-discriminatory requirements. It also establishes penalties, including contract termination, for non-compliance, thus encouraging adherence to the law.

The introduction of the FIND Act reflects a broader national dialogue on the firearm industry, particularly in the wake of increasing scrutiny and regulatory pressures post various high-profile incidents. It underscores the Republican Party's commitment to supporting the rights and interests of the firearm community amidst  a landscape of evolving public sentiment and legislative challenges.

As the bill progresses, its supporters aim to galvanize bipartisan support, emphasizing the importance of fair competition and free-market principles in government contracting. The FIND Act has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the TBI and PTSD Treatment Act, aimed at expanding medical assistance for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The bill mandates the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy to eligible veterans diagnosed with these conditions. 

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing awareness of the long-term effects of TBI and PTSD on veterans. These conditions often stem from the rigors of military service and can significantly impair quality of life. Current treatment options are limited, and advocates argue that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can potentially aid in alleviating symptoms related to both disorders. Studies have indicated that this treatment may promote healing and recovery in patients with brain injuries and PTSD.

The potential impact of the TBI and PTSD Treatment Act is significant. By requiring the VA to cover hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the bill aims to enhance the health care options available to veterans, ultimately improving their mental and physical well-being. Proponents of the measure believe it can result in reduced healthcare costs in the long term, as improving veterans' health can lead to fewer hospitalizations and associated medical needs.

This legislative effort is part of a broader push to improve mental health care access for veterans, especially as understanding of PTSD and TBI continues to evolve. With bipartisan support, the bill has been referred to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for further consideration, signaling a proactive approach to addressing veterans' healthcare needs. If passed, this act could set a precedent for future initiatives focused on comprehensive care for veterans facing similar health challenges.

The bill (H.R. 72) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Ann Wagner, R-MO, has introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill aimed at ensuring increased medical protections for infants who survive an abortion. The legislation seeks to mandate specific care protocols for healthcare providers in instances where a child is born alive after an abortion attempt, asserting that such infants receive the same level of medical attention afforded to any newborn.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing national debates surrounding abortion and reproductive rights. Proponents argue that the legislation is essential to protect vulnerable infants and ensure that they receive necessary medical care immediately upon their birth. The bill stipulates that healthcare practitioners must provide the same level of care to these newborns as they would to any other child born at the same gestational age, requiring immediate transport to a hospital if necessary.

Should the bill pass, it would not only impose legal responsibilities on healthcare providers but also establish penalties for non-compliance, potentially including fines and imprisonment. It also allows mothers of children born alive to pursue civil damages for any violations of the protections outlined in the bill. Given the divisive nature of the abortion debate, the proposed legislation stands to impact the broader conversation on reproductive rights in America, adding a layer of complexity regarding the legal status and rights of aborted fetuses.

Thus far, the House has shown support for the bill, which reflects the ongoing emphasis among conservative lawmakers to introduce measures that seek to restrict abortion access while promoting the protection of unborn and newborn life. The bill is currently under review in the Senate Judiciary Committee as discussions on its implications continue.

The bill (H.R. 21) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 163 co-sponsors.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced a bill aiming to repeal the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, a landmark legislation designed to enhance voter registration processes across the United States. The NVRA, also known as the Motor Voter Law, was established to simplify voter registration and expand access to the electoral process, allowing individuals to register when applying for or renewing their driver's license.

The introduction of this bill follows a growing movement among some Republican lawmakers who argue that the NVRA has led to widespread voter fraud and administrative complications. Proponents of the repeal contend that it hinders states’ autonomy to manage voter registration in ways they believe are more secure and efficient. Critics, however, warn that abolishing the NVRA could disenfranchise voters, especially marginalized groups who may rely on its provisions for easier access to registration.

If passed, this bill would significantly alter the landscape of voter registration in the U.S., removing the federal mandate for states to offer registration through public agencies. This could lead to a patchwork of state regulations, which some fear could create barriers for eligible voters. The NVRA was originally enacted with widespread bipartisan support, making its repeal a controversial move in the current polarized political climate.

The House Committee on House Administration received the bill for further consideration, signaling a potential for heated debates as lawmakers grapple with its implications on democratic participation. As discussions unfold, the future of the bill remains uncertain, but its introduction undoubtedly injects new vigor into ongoing conversations about voting rights and election integrity across the country.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Ensuring United Families at the Border Act, aiming to amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to clarify standards around family detention. This legislation is designed to address what Rep. Biggs identifies as a crucial need for consistent handling of family units at the U.S. border.

The bill responds to ongoing challenges in managing family units amidst the complex landscape of immigration law and reinforces a framework allowing families to remain together while facing detention. It seeks to amend existing laws that dictate the treatment of child detainees, ensuring that a child accompanying an adult facing misdemeanor charges for unlawful entry can still be detained together. This approach aims to balance immigration enforcement with the needs of families seeking asylum or entry into the United States.

The introduction of this bill comes as immigration policies and family separations at the border continue to spark heated discussions and divergent opinions. By clarifying detention policies, Rep. Biggs aims to strengthen the administration's ability to manage family units and reduce tensions surrounding immigration enforcement.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it seeks to preempt state regulations on family detention facilities and set a national standard. This legislation may affect the federal immigration strategy, particularly how families are processed at the Customs and Border Protection level.

In summary, the Ensuring United Families at the Border Act underscores a critical shift towards maintaining family unity during immigration proceedings, reflecting a broader effort to streamline immigration processes while addressing humanitarian concerns at the border. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Armed Forces Endangered Species Exemption Act, aiming to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This legislation seeks to limit restrictions on military installations by preventing the designation of these lands as critical habitats for endangered species, aimed primarily at facilitating military operations.

The proposal comes amid concerns that current environmental regulations hinder military readiness and operations, particularly in areas designated for national defense-related activities. Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Defense would be granted broader authority to declare lands off-limits to endangered species protections if deemed necessary for defense purposes. The bill articulates that military installations, including National Guard facilities, would be specifically excluded from such designations, allowing for uninterrupted training and testing operations.

Proponents argue that the bill is essential for maintaining national security, asserting that stringent environmental regulations can impede military preparedness and the effective testing of defense technologies. They believe that allowing more flexibility in land use supports both the military and local economies reliant on defense contracts.

Critics of the bill raise serious concerns about potential adverse effects on endangered species and their habitats. Environmental advocates argue that loosening protections undermines efforts to sustain vulnerable ecosystems, placing species at further risk of extinction. The push for this legislation reflects ongoing tensions between military interests and environmental conservation.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Natural Resources for review, its implications could reshape the balance between national defense and environmental stewardship. The outcome will be closely watched by both military advocates and conservationists as it signals a shift in how land is managed for defense operations.

The bill (H.R. 65) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act, aimed at establishing a dedicated financial account to support the construction and maintenance of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. This legislation seeks to channel federal funds specifically toward border security initiatives to address rising concerns regarding illegal crossings.

The introduction of this bill comes amid persistent debates over border security measures and the integrity of U.S. national borders. Proponents argue that a strengthened border wall is essential to deter illegal immigration and enhance public safety. The act proposes the establishment of the Secure the Southern Border Fund, which would allow the U.S. Treasury to compartmentalize funds specifically allocated for border security, including construction and essential equipment for border patrol agents.

If passed, the legislation could significantly impact federal spending priorities by enforcing a structured financial approach to border security. The bill mandates that funds allocated for the construction of barriers will not only support the physical infrastructure but also assist in addressing logistical needs, such as vehicles and equipment for Border Patrol operations.

Additionally, the act outlines a mechanism for financial accountability; for instance, it prescribes a methodology for assessing illegal border crossings and subsequently adjusting foreign aid based on those statistics. This element aims to create accountability for nations that may contribute to increased illegal immigration.

Given its potential ramifications, this proposal is likely to ignite discussions across both sides of the political aisle.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Drain the Intelligence Community Swamp Act of 2025, aimed at revoking security clearances for several former members of the intelligence community. This legislative measure is primarily motivated by concerns surrounding these officials' involvement in the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, prompting calls for increased accountability within the intelligence sector.

The proposal seeks to immediately revoke the security clearances of individuals who signed a public statement regarding the Hunter Biden emails in 2020, as well as enforcing a ban on providing security clearances to these individuals in the future. It mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General to investigate their connections to the Biden presidential campaign and their roles in handling sensitive information. This legislation underscores the complex intersection of politics and national security, as well as the growing demand for oversight in the intelligence community.

Supporters of the bill argue that it represents a necessary step in safeguarding the integrity of national security operations by eliminating potential conflicts of interest and perceived biases among key intelligence figures. Critics, however, worry that the bill could undermine the credibility of the intelligence community by politicizing security clearances and investigations.

The legislation has been assigned to the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, and Armed Services for further consideration. As discussions unfold, the bill highlights a broader discourse on transparency and accountability in the government, suggesting a potential shift in how intelligence operations interact with political developments.

This legislative effort marks the beginning of what could be a contentious debate as Congress grapples with issues of trust, integrity, and the necessary boundaries of political influence over intelligence matters.

The bill (H.R. 80) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Davidson, Warren [R-OH-8]...01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Terri Sewell, D-AL, has introduced the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2025, a critical bill aimed at amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to strengthen protections against voter discrimination. The legislation seeks to update the criteria for determining which states and jurisdictions are subject to scrutiny under federal voting laws, helping to safeguard the voting rights of marginalized populations.

This legislation was prompted by growing concerns over recent state-level measures perceived to dilute voter rights, particularly affecting minority groups. By revising the criteria for federal oversight, Sewell's bill aims to enhance the ability of courts to address claims of vote dilution, denial, and abridgment. The act seeks to ensure that voting practices do not disproportionately burden or discriminate against any racial or language minority group.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it would allow federal authorities to better monitor and challenge discriminatory voting laws. By establishing a more robust framework for evaluating voting rights violations, the bill seeks to uphold the democratic principle that every citizen should have an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process.

The introduction of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act comes at a time when voting rights remain a contentious issue in the United States. By fortifying legal protections against discrimination, the bill aims to empower voters and restore faith in the electoral system. With strong bipartisan support, it represents a crucial step towards ensuring fair and equitable voting access for all Americans. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration and debate.

The bill (H.R. 14) introduced on 03/05/2025 has 216 co-sponsors.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Bobby Scott, D-VA, has introduced the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2025, aimed at strengthening labor protections and enhancing workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain. This legislation seeks to amend several key labor laws to bolster employee rights, impose stricter penalties for unfair labor practices, and facilitate union elections.

The bill comes amid growing concerns over workplace rights and the erosion of collective bargaining capabilities. Advocates argue that the current legal framework inadequately protects workers against retaliation for organizing efforts, citing a rise in anti-union tactics by employers. By enhancing the legal mechanisms available to address unfair labor practices, the legislation aims to empower workers and reduce barriers to unionization.

If enacted, the bill would allow for significant changes to the National Labor Relations Act, enabling broader definitions of what constitutes an employee, thereby protecting more gig and contingent workers. The proposed legislation would also make it illegal for employers to threaten or discriminate against employees participating in union activities and would mandate that employers provide labor organizations with information about eligible voters before union elections.

The potential impact of this bill is substantial, as it could lead to an increase in union membership and collective bargaining agreements, ultimately resulting in improved wages and working conditions for American workers. Furthermore, the bill emphasizes electronic voting in union elections to streamline the process and increase participation.

In conclusion, the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act is positioned as a crucial step toward revitalizing the labor movement in the U.S. by ensuring that workers have stronger protections and opportunities for organization, reflecting the ongoing struggle for labor rights in the contemporary workforce.

The bill (H.R. 20) introduced on 03/05/2025 has 210 co-sponsors.

WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced a landmark piece of legislation aimed at granting statehood to Washington, D.C. The Washington, D.C. Admission Act proposes to officially recognize the district as the 51st state, allowing its residents to elect their own congressional representatives and receive the full rights afforded to citizens of the United States.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to a longstanding movement advocating for the rights of D.C. residents, who, despite being subject to federal laws and taxes, have lacked congressional representation. Norton emphasized that the more than 700,000 residents of D.C. deserve equal treatment under the law. If passed, the bill will also address governance issues by establishing a State Constitution and the framework for local governance, elections, and federal relations.

The potential impact of the Washington, D.C. Admission Act is significant. It aims to empower residents with the ability to elect senators and representatives at the federal level, thereby ensuring their voices are heard in Congress. Currently, D.C. operates under the unique status of a federal district, which limits its autonomy and representation. This legislation could alter the dynamics in Congress, allowing for a permanent increase in its membership.

Historically, D.C. has faced challenges in seeking statehood, with previous efforts blocked by opposition in Congress. However, with growing public support and increasing recognition of voting rights as a critical issue in American politics, advocates for the bill remain optimistic. Norton’s introduction marks a pivotal step forward in a decades-long struggle for justice and representation for D.C. residents. The bill has been referred to multiple committees for consideration, paving the way for debate in Congress.

The bill (H.R. 51) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 184 co-sponsors.
