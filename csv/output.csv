WASHINGTON, March 5 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No Mandates Act, legislation aimed at prohibiting any federal mandates related to COVID-19 vaccinations. The bill ensures that individuals cannot be required to receive the vaccine for access to federal facilities or services, and extends to prohibiting federally funded entities from mandating vaccinations in order to provide services.

Biggs has underscored the importance of personal choice and medical freedom in the current political climate, especially following widespread public concern about health mandates. The bill emerged in response to increased pressures for COVID-19 vaccinations in various sectors, triggering significant public debate regarding individual rights versus public health responsibilities.

Should the No Mandates Act become law, it would impose restrictions on federal agencies and create consequences for entities that do not comply. Specifically, organizations receiving federal funds as part of COVID-19 relief packages would be barred from enforcing vaccination as a condition for service provision. Non-compliant entities would be required to return federal funds, aiming to deter any coercive vaccination practices.

The expected impact of this legislation could lead to a significant shift in how vaccination policies are approached within federal programs and agencies. It reflects ongoing tensions between different views on pandemic management, personal freedoms, and public health initiatives. As COVID-19 continues to influence American life, the No Mandates Act seeks to solidify an approach that does not require vaccinations at the federal level.

The bill has been referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, alongside the House Administration and Energy and Commerce committees, increasing its visibility in legislative discussions moving forward.

The bill (H.R. 120) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 5 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No Vaccine Passports Act, aiming to prohibit federal agencies from issuing any form of vaccine passport or documentation related to COVID-19 vaccination status. The proposed legislation seeks to prevent the government from certifying or sharing vaccination records with third parties, asserting that such actions infringe on the privacy rights of citizens.

The bill comes in response to heightened concerns over government overreach and the potential normalization of health credentials tied to personal freedoms. Proponents argue that mandating vaccine passports could lead to discrimination and limited access to public services, creating a divided society where individuals are judged based on their vaccination status. 

If passed, the No Vaccine Passports Act would ensure that proof of vaccination would not be required for access to federal properties or services. This law is seen as a critical step in protecting individual liberties in the context of public health policies that emerged during the pandemic. 

Currently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as well as the House Administration Committee, the bill reflects a growing trend among lawmakers who advocate for personal choice in healthcare decisions. The introduction of this legislation signals a potential shift in congressional priorities as lawmakers navigate post-pandemic governance.

In addition to its implications for vaccination policies, the bill underscores broader discussions about health privacy and civil liberties in an increasingly health-conscious society. The outcome of this bill could substantially affect the landscape of public health policy and individual rights in the United States.

The bill (H.R. 121) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 5 -- Rep. Al Green, D-TX, has introduced the Original Living American Wage Act, aimed at fundamentally changing the way minimum wage is calculated in the United States. The bill seeks to align the federal minimum wage with the federal supplemental poverty threshold, specifically for a renter family of four with two children under age 18, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to alarming poverty statistics in the country. Approximately 37.9 million Americans live below the poverty line, with many minimum wage workers unable to afford basic necessities, including housing. The current federal minimum wage is insufficient to meet even the most basic living costs, with many workers relying on public assistance to make ends meet. The Proposed LAW Act aims to provide a more sustainable income for families by phasing in significant increases to the minimum wage over the next few years.

If enacted, the bill would set minimum wage rates beginning at $10.59 per hour in 2026, escalating to $26.59 per hour by 2030. The bill mandates that future adjustments to the minimum wage are made in tandem with inflation and economic conditions. This approach is designed to ensure that workers earn an income that is at least 40% above the poverty threshold, thereby aiming to reduce dependency on government welfare programs.

Supporters argue that the Original LAW Act addresses the disparity between wages and living costs, making a powerful statement about the need for a living wage that supports the needs of all Americans. With this legislation, Rep. Green intends to initiate a vital conversation about economic equity and labor rights in the contemporary workforce. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 122) was introduced on 01/03/2025.
