WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Christopher Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2025, aimed at prohibiting federal funds from being used for abortion services or insurance coverage that includes abortion. This legislation responds to ongoing debates regarding taxpayer involvement in funding abortion services.

The bill seeks to amend existing laws and introduce measures to ensure that no federal resources, including those from trust funds, are allocated for abortion procedures. Additionally, it imposes restrictions on health benefits, stipulating that health insurance plans funded by federal money cannot cover abortion except in specific situations, such as instances of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the mother. 

Supporters of the bill argue that taxpayer dollars should not finance abortions, holding the belief that such funding contradicts the values of many citizens. Proponents claim that the legislation will foster greater transparency in health insurance coverage by mandating full disclosure of any abortion-related costs in policy documents. As part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the proposed legislation also aims to restrict premium tax credits for plans that provide abortion coverage, further emphasizing the intent to decouple federal support from abortion services.

Should the bill pass, its provisions could significantly impact how health care plans are structured and how individuals access reproductive health services under federal programs. Political reactions to the bill are likely to remain polarized, reflecting deep divisions in public opinion on abortion rights. The bill is expected to undergo scrutiny and debate as it is referred to various committees for consideration and potentially modified or challenged during the legislative process.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Terri Sewell, D-AL, has introduced the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by updating the criteria determining which states and political subdivisions are subject to scrutiny under federal voting laws. This legislation seeks to combat ongoing voter suppression and enhance protections for racial and language minority groups across the United States.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing concerns about voter access amidst rising reports of discriminatory practices. The new legislation aims to reinforce the provisions of the Voting Rights Act by implementing more stringent criteria for states that have historically engaged in practices undermining voter rights. Among the changes is a new formula for covering states and the introduction of comprehensive guidelines for evaluating voting procedures, particularly their impact on minority voters.

Should this bill pass, it could significantly alter how states manage voting qualifications and hinder attempts to implement laws that disproportionately burden marginalized communities. By focusing on historical patterns of voting discrimination, the law could lead to greater federal oversight in jurisdictions identified as problematic. 

Background on voting rights reveals a persistent struggle in the U.S., with landmark legislation historically aimed at removing barriers for voters of color. The current bill is named after civil rights icon John R. Lewis, who dedicated his life to fighting for equitable voting access. With 216 cosponsors, this initiative reflects a growing commitment among lawmakers to address systemic inequalities in the electoral process and protect the democratic rights of all citizens. 

The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration, with advocates urging swift action to secure voting rights for generations to come.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Bobby Scott, D-VA, has introduced the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2025, a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at strengthening workers' rights and enhancing protections for labor organizing activities. This bill targets the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and aims to make significant amendments to modernize labor relations in the United States.

The introduction of this bill reflects growing concerns among lawmakers about the erosion of labor rights and the need for a robust legal framework that supports union activities. Recent surveys indicate that a significant portion of American workers are in favor of unionizing but face hurdles such as employer intimidation and inadequate legal protections. By revising existing laws, this legislation seeks to make it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions.

One of the bill's key components involves clarifying the definitions of employee classifications to prevent workers from being incorrectly labeled as independent contractors, thereby ensuring their access to union protections. Additionally, the legislation proposes measures that would penalize unfair labor practices more effectively, ensuring that workers who suffer retaliation for organizing efforts receive compensation.

The bill also emphasizes electronic voting in union elections, which could increase participation and enhance the democratic process within labor organizations. By improving accessibility and transparency, the initiative is expected to encourage more employees to participate in union activities, ultimately fostering a stronger labor movement.

The Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act is a significant attempt to reshape labor law and strengthen the rights of American workers, ensuring that they have the support needed to advocate for their interests in the workplace.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Ann Wagner, R-MO, has introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, aimed at protecting infants who survive abortion attempts. This legislation mandates that healthcare providers deliver adequate medical care to any newborn who is born alive following an abortion, ensuring they receive the same level of care as any other child born under similar circumstances.

The introduction of this bill reflects a growing concern among lawmakers regarding the treatment of infants who survive abortion procedures. Proponents argue that the current legal framework does not adequately protect these vulnerable infants, emphasizing the need for a more robust legal standard. The bill proposes specific requirements that healthcare practitioners must fulfill when a child is born alive due to an abortion attempt, including immediate admission to a hospital and mandatory reporting of non-compliance.

Should this bill pass, it could significantly impact abortion providers and healthcare facilities, establishing stricter requirements and potential legal ramifications for non-compliance. The proposed legislation also includes provisions that allow mothers of children born alive to seek civil remedies for violations, enabling them to claim damages for psychological and physical injuries resulting from negligent care.

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act sits within a broader legislative effort to address abortion-related issues, indicating a polarized climate in Congress. As public and political discourse surrounding abortion intensifies, this bill joins similar measures designed to heighten restrictions on abortion practices nationwide. With the bill now introduced in both the House and Senate, its progress will culminate in heated debates reflecting sharp divisions among lawmakers and constituents alike.

https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/22/text|$H billintroh-250103-hr22|Rep. Roy Introduces SAVE Act|"
WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, has introduced the SAVE Act, which aims to amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by requiring proof of U.S. citizenship for individuals registering to vote in federal elections. This legislation is part of ongoing efforts to enhance election security and ensure that only eligible voters participate.

The introduction of the SAVE Act comes amid increasing concerns over election integrity. Proponents believe that requiring citizenship documentation will help prevent fraudulent registrations and maintain the legitimacy of the electoral process. The bill outlines specific forms of accepted proof, including U.S. passports and military identification, in an attempt to standardize the requirements across states.

The implications of this bill are significant. If enacted, it could establish a precedent for stricter voting requirements nationwide, potentially influencing voter turnout among certain demographics. Critics argue that such measures may suppress the votes of eligible citizens who may not possess the required documentation.

Historically, voter registration laws have varied widely among states, resulting in a patchwork of regulations that can complicate the voting process. The SAVE Act seeks to centralize these requirements, aiming to simplify and streamline voter registration procedures. This proposal has garnered bipartisan sponsorship but remains contentious in the current politically polarized climate.

As the bill moves to the Committee on House Administration, discussions will likely center around balancing election security with accessibility for voters. Advocates for the legislation assert that ensuring only citizens vote is fundamental to democracy, while opponents warn of potential disenfranchisement of eligible voters who may face challenges in obtaining the necessary documentation.

The bill (H.R. 22) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 88 co-sponsors: Rep. Garbarino, Andrew R. [R-NY-2] 01/03/2025; Rep. Malliotakis, Nicole [R-NY-11] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, a bill aimed at imposing sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) for any actions taken against U.S. citizens or allied nations’ officials. This legislative push comes in response to the ICC's recent efforts to investigate and potentially prosecute Israeli leaders, which the bill claims lack legitimacy due to the ICC's jurisdictional claims over non-member states.

The Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act seeks to protect U.S. military personnel and officials from prosecution by the ICC. The bill asserts that since the United States and its allies are not parties to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, the court holds no authority to pursue legal actions against them. By calling for sanctions, the bill aims to deter what its sponsors view as unwarranted legal overreach from an institution they argue undermines the sovereignty of nations.

The bill's proponents believe that failing to counter ICC initiatives may set a dangerous precedent that could expose U.S. military personnel to international prosecution. This concern is intensified by historical instances where the ICC has issued warrants against figures like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, actions that some lawmakers argue threaten the safety of allied states and foster diplomatic tensions.

The Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act also outlines a framework for immediate sanctions against individuals involved in any ICC investigations concerning U.S. or allied entities. By targeting foreign individuals who engage with the ICC's investigations, the bill endeavors to uphold the rights of U.S. citizens while asserting American sovereignty on the global stage. As the debate surrounding the ICC's legitimacy intensifies, this bill positions itself as a crucial front in defending national interests against international judicial actions.

The bill (H.R. 23) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 38 co-sponsors: Rep. Mast, Brian J. [R-FL-21] 01/03/2025; Rep. McCaul, Michael T. [R-TX-10] 01/03/2025; Rep. Crenshaw, Dan [R-TX-2] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Earl L. Buddy Carter, R-GA, has introduced the FairTax Act, aiming to replace the current federal income tax system with a national sales tax. The legislation seeks to abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and promote a consumption-based tax structure that is administered primarily by the states.

The FairTax Act comes amid ongoing debates about the fairness and efficiency of the existing tax system, which many argue hampers economic growth and complicates compliance. With this proposal, Carter intends to eliminate the income tax, payroll taxes, and estate taxes, arguing that they create an undue burden on Americans and hinder economic mobility. By simplifying the tax code and focusing on consumption rather than income, the measure aims to stimulate savings and investment while enhancing productivity.

Under the provisions of the FairTax Act, a national sales tax will be imposed on goods and services purchased for final consumption, essentially shifting the tax burden from income to spending. This approach, proponents claim, mirrors state sales tax systems already in place in most states, which could facilitate a smoother implementation. The bill also outlines a monthly rebate mechanism designed to assist low-income families, ensuring that their tax burden is minimized.

The potential impact of the FairTax Act could be substantial, as it seeks to change the fundamental way Americans relate to federal taxation. If enacted, it would require considerable adjustments from both taxpayers and tax administrators. However, critics warn that the transition could create volatility in federal revenue and disproportionately affect lower-income households without appropriate safeguards. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation.

The bill (H.R. 25) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 13 co-sponsors: Rep. Clyde, Andrew S. [R-GA-9] 01/03/2025; Rep. Carter, John R. [R-TX-31] 01/03/2025; Rep. Perry, Scott [R-PA-10] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, has introduced the Protecting American Energy Production Act, a comprehensive bill aimed at ensuring the continuation of hydraulic fracturing practices for oil and natural gas production across the United States. The legislation prohibits any declaration of a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing unless it is formally authorized by an Act of Congress.

The Protecting American Energy Production Act was designed in response to growing concerns from energy producers about potential federal regulations that could limit or eliminate the use of hydraulic fracturing, a critical method for extracting energy resources. Proponents argue that the method is vital for maintaining energy independence and bolstering the U.S. economy. The bill has gained traction among many Republicans, who assert that local and state authorities should retain control over energy production methods.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant. If passed, it could prevent federal intervention in state-regulated energy activities, allowing for the continued use of hydraulic fracturing without restrictions imposed by the executive branch. With ongoing debates about energy policy in Congress, this bill represents a key effort to solidify hydraulic fracturing as a cornerstone of American energy production.

The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders in the energy industry, emphasizing the need for stable and predictable regulations to foster growth and innovation. With the energy sector currently facing various challenges, including fluctuating oil prices and global competition, the introduction of the Protecting American Energy Production Act seeks to reinforce the U.S.’s position as a leader in energy production. Rep. Pfluger’s initiative will now await further consideration within the relevant congressional committees.

The bill (H.R. 26) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 18 co-sponsors: Rep. Houchin, Erin [R-IN-9] 01/07/2025; Rep. Bice, Stephanie I. [R-OK-5] 01/09/2025; Rep. Lawler, Michael [R-NY-17] 01/09/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-VA, has introduced the HALT Fentanyl Act, designed to combat the rising threat of fentanyl-related substances across the United States. The legislation aims to amend the Controlled Substances Act to include stringent scheduling provisions for fentanyl and its analogs, thereby enhancing law enforcement capabilities to tackle synthetic opioid trafficking.

The introduction of the HALT Fentanyl Act comes amid an unprecedented surge in opioid-related overdose deaths, particularly from fentanyl, which has been devastating communities nationwide. This bill seeks to streamline the classification of fentanyl-related substances, ensuring that any structurally related compound falls under stricter regulations unless explicitly exempt. By broadening the scope of what constitutes a controlled substance, the bill aims to close loopholes exploited by traffickers.

Key provisions of the bill include expedited registration processes for researchers working with these substances, which advocates argue will facilitate the study and potential development of therapeutic interventions without compromising safety regulations. Moreover, the legislation mandates transparency from the Attorney General regarding the criteria for evaluating applications related to fentanyl research, thus promoting accountability in governmental oversight.

Currently, fentanyl remains one of the leading causes of overdose deaths in the United States, with the CDC reporting tens of thousands of fatalities attributable to synthetic opioids. By passing the HALT Fentanyl Act, proponents believe it will not only bolster law enforcement's ability to respond effectively but also raise public awareness about the dangers of these potent drugs.

As the bill progresses through Congress, its supporters hope that it will garner bipartisan support, reflecting a unified commitment to addressing the opioid crisis and safeguarding communities. A vote on the legislation in the House is anticipated in the coming weeks.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. W. Gregory Steube, R-FL, has introduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025, aiming to amend Title IX to establish clear definitions around sex in athletics. The bill mandates that sex be recognized solely based on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, ensuring that only female athletes can compete in women's sports programs.

The legislation responds to ongoing debates regarding inclusivity in sports and aims to preserve competitive fairness for women and girls. As discussions about the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports have intensified, Rep. Steube advocates that biological distinctions are crucial to maintaining equitable conditions in athletic competitions. He emphasizes that enabling males to compete in female-designated events could jeopardize opportunities for female athletes, including access to scholarships and participation spots.

If enacted, the bill would prohibit institutions receiving federal funding from allowing individuals classified as male at birth to participate in women's sports. It also calls for a study by the Comptroller General to assess the implications of mixed-gender participation in these programs, including potential psychological and social impacts on female athletes. 

This legislation has garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader national debate about gender identity and its implications in athletic settings. Supporters believe it reinforces the spirit of fair competition, while opponents argue it may exclude or marginalize transgender and non-binary individuals, raising questions of equality and rights. The bill has already passed in the House and is set to move forward in the legislative process, indicating its potential to shape the future of women’s sports in the U.S.

https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/29/text|$H billintroh-250103-hr29|Rep. Collins Introduces the Laken Riley Act|"
WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Mike Collins, R-GA, has introduced the Laken Riley Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement by mandating the detention of aliens charged with theft in the United States. This bill seeks to enhance the powers of the Secretary of Homeland Security in apprehending undocumented individuals involved in such criminal activities.

The Laken Riley Act comes in response to increasing concerns about theft-related crimes and their impact on community safety. By requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to take custody of aliens charged with theft, the legislation aims to deter such offenses and enhance public security. Proponents argue that this measure will provide necessary resources for states grappling with the aftermath of theft crimes committed by undocumented individuals.

One of the key provisions emphasizes the involvement of state attorneys general in enforcement efforts. This expands the authority of state officials to challenge federal decisions regarding the release of detained aliens in state courts. By allowing states to seek injunctive relief against federal decisions perceived as harmful, the bill aims to empower local authorities in their pursuit of justice.

The bill's introduction comes at a time when immigration policies remain a focal point of national debate. Advocates for stricter regulations maintain that allowing for the apprehension and detention of individuals charged with theft is a necessary step to ensure both public safety and the integrity of the immigration system. If enacted, the Laken Riley Act may set a precedent for future immigration legislation, potentially reshaping the legal landscape for undocumented individuals facing criminal charges. 

With broad support in the House, the legislation has already passed the chamber and awaits further consideration in the Senate.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, has introduced the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing the immigration laws regarding aliens convicted of domestic violence and sexual offenses. This bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare these individuals inadmissible and deportable from the United States.

The introduction of this bill reflects growing concerns regarding public safety and the need for strict enforcement of immigration laws related to violent crimes. Proponents argue that by denying entry and deporting aliens guilty of such offenses, the legislation aims to provide a safer environment for women and families, addressing a significant social issue. Following numerous cases that highlighted the need for reform, this bill intends to prevent further violence by ensuring that those with a history of crimes affecting vulnerable populations face strict legal repercussions.

If enacted, the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act would enforce that aliens who admit to or are convicted of domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, or violations of protection orders would not only be considered inadmissible but also subject to deportation proceedings. This expanded definition under the amended law reflects a broader perspective on violent crime and its impact on the community.

The timing of this legislation coincides with rising interest in immigration reform and public safety legislation, marking another effort in Congress to confront issues that resonate with constituents concerned about crime and protection for women. As this bill progresses, it will undergo scrutiny and debate, shaping its potential impact on immigration policy and community safety nationwide.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the POLICE Act of 2025 aimed at making the assault of law enforcement officers a deportable offense. This legislation seeks to enhance the protections for law enforcement personnel by imposing stricter consequences for those who commit acts of violence against them.

The impetus behind this bill is the rising concern over the safety of law enforcement officers across the nation. Supporters argue that such measures are necessary to deter assaults and ensure that those who target first responders face significant repercussions. By classifying the assault of an officer as a deportable offense, the bill underscores a zero-tolerance approach towards violence against law enforcement.

The proposed changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act enhance existing laws by specifically defining assault against a law enforcement officer and clearly establishing the criteria under which an individual may be subjected to deportation. Under this act, any alien convicted of assaulting a law enforcement officer or admitting to committing such acts during their official duties could face deportation. 

The bill also mandates that the Department of Homeland Security submit annual reports to Congress detailing the number of deportations that occur under this provision. Advocates believe that this transparency will hold agencies accountable and ensure ongoing discussions about immigration enforcement and public safety.

This legislation arrives amidst a contentious national dialogue surrounding police funding and public safety measures, highlighting a growing emphasis on protecting those in law enforcement. As the bill moves to the House Judiciary Committee, it is set to engage legislators in a larger conversation about balancing public safety with immigrant rights and community relations. The outcome will likely resonate with constituents concerned about law enforcement protection and immigration issues alike.

The bill (H.R. 31) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 15 co-sponsors: Rep. Houchin, Erin [R-IN-9] 01/03/2025; Rep. Tenney, Claudia [R-NY-24] 01/03/2025; Rep. Malliotakis, Nicole [R-NY-11] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Nick LaLota, R-NY, has introduced the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act, a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting federal funding to jurisdictions that provide benefits to undocumented immigrants. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, outlines strict eligibility criteria for federal funds, specifically targeting sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The primary impetus for this legislation is a growing concern among some lawmakers about the financial burdens that sanctuary policies impose on local and state governments. Supporters argue that these jurisdictions should not receive federal assistance while actively obstructing U.S. immigration laws. The bill aims to enforce compliance by withholding funds that would be used to support services for undocumented immigrants, such as healthcare, legal assistance, and transportation.

If passed, the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act would define sanctuary jurisdictions based on their policies regarding sharing information with federal immigration entities and their compliance with detainer requests. The legislation demands that the Secretary of Homeland Security report annually to Congress on jurisdictions classified as non-compliant with federal immigration directives. 

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it could limit resources available to many cities and states, forcing them to reassess their immigration policies and practices. Critics of the bill warn that it may inadvertently harm vulnerable populations while making little difference to actual enforcement of immigration laws. 

LaLota's introduction of this bill reflects ongoing national debates surrounding immigration policy, local governance, and the role of federal funding. As the bill moves to the House Committee on the Judiciary, lawmakers will likely consider its ramifications for both federal funding and local sovereignty in managing immigration-related issues.

The bill (H.R. 32) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 15 co-sponsors: Rep. Feenstra, Randy [R-IA-4] 01/03/2025; Rep. Houchin, Erin [R-IN-9] 01/03/2025; Rep. McCaul, Michael T. [R-TX-10] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, has introduced the United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to lower tax burdens for residents of Taiwan earning income from U.S. sources. This initiative is expected to facilitate increased economic cooperation and trade relations between the United States and Taiwan.

The legislation comes at a time when the U.S. seeks to bolster alliances in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in light of rising economic tensions in global trade. By creating streamlined taxation protocols for certain Taiwanese residents, the bill intends to encourage investments and business transactions between the two economies. Specifically, it aims to reduce withholding tax rates on various income forms including dividends, interest, and royalties.

The potential impact of the bill extends beyond mere economic benefits; it also serves as a strategic response to geopolitical pressures. Increased economic ties with Taiwan could enhance both countries' position against geopolitical rivals. Supporters argue that more favorable tax treatment will attract Taiwanese companies and entrepreneurs, prompting them to engage more significantly in the U.S. market.

The proposal, which passed overwhelmingly in the House with a vote of 423 to 1, highlights a broader U.S. strategy to foster growth in regions crucial for its economic interests. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for a formal tax agreement, authorized by this bill, which will address dual taxation issues that have historically hampered U.S.-Taiwan economic relations.

As discussions move forward, this legislation is poised to reshape the economic landscape between the U.S. and Taiwan, potentially allowing for broader collaborative initiatives in the future. It remains to be seen how the Senate will respond to this critical measure.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Paul Gosar, R-AZ, has introduced the Land And Social Security Optimization Act or LASSO Act, aimed at bolstering the Social Security Trust Fund through revenue generated from public lands. This legislation proposes that 10% of the revenue collected by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture from specified public lands be earmarked for deposit into the Social Security Trust Fund.

The introduction of the LASSO Act comes amid ongoing debates regarding the sustainability of the Social Security program, which faces fiscal challenges as the population ages. By redirecting a portion of public land revenue, Gosar hopes to provide a new funding mechanism that could alleviate some of the pressure on Social Security, ensuring its viability for future generations. The bill specifies that the funds should come from revenue without raising costs for activities associated with public lands, and it guarantees that state and local governments will not see a reduction in their revenue share.

The concept of utilizing public land revenue is not entirely new; various funding proposals have been put forth in different contexts. However, the LASSO Act distinguishes itself by explicitly linking this revenue to the Social Security Trust Fund, framing it as a critical initiative for fiscal responsibility. This move is expected to generate substantial discussions within both the Natural Resources and Agriculture committees, where the bill has been referred for further consideration.

As lawmakers weigh the implications of this proposal, stakeholders across the political spectrum will be watching closely, considering both its potential benefits and challenges. The LASSO Act serves as a bold step toward ensuring that the financial support needed for Social Security remains a priority in federal budgeting.

The bill (H.R. 34) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 10 co-sponsors: Rep. Donalds, Byron [R-FL-19] 01/22/2025; Rep. Norman, Ralph [R-SC-5] 02/06/2025; Rep. Hamadeh, Abraham [R-AZ-8] 02/06/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-AZ, has introduced the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, aimed at strengthening penalties for individuals who intentionally evade pursuing law enforcement officers while operating a vehicle. This legislation seeks to heighten safety protocols for Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement members, particularly in areas close to the U.S.-Mexico border.

The impetus behind the bill arises from increasing reports of assaults on law enforcement officials during vehicle pursuits. With recent statistics showing a rise in such incidents, the legislation aims to deter reckless behavior by imposing significant criminal and immigration penalties. Offenses under this bill would include fleeing from both federal and local law enforcement officers in a vehicle, with harsher penalties for causing serious bodily harm or death during these pursuits.

Under the proposed law, if a person is convicted of evading law enforcement, they could face a maximum penalty of up to 20 years for causing serious injury and life imprisonment if death results from their actions. In addition to criminal penalties, the bill mandates that convicted individuals may also face immigration repercussions, including inadmissibility and deportation from the United States.

By implementing these stricter penalties, the Act aims to safeguard law enforcement officers while enhancing public safety. The bill has already garnered attention within Congress, reflecting a growing consensus on the need for enhanced measures to protect those who serve on the front lines of law enforcement. The legislation has passed the House and is currently awaiting further consideration in the Senate.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Joe Wilson, R-SC, has introduced the MEGOBARI Act, a legislative initiative aimed at countering the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, the Iranian regime, and the Russian Federation in Georgia. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, seeks to support Georgia's democratic aspirations and bolster U.S. relations in the region.

The MEGOBARI Act addresses rising concerns regarding Georgia's political landscape, marked by increasing ties to authoritarian nations and significant democratic backsliding. The legislation emphasizes the need for the United States to reaffirm its commitment to supporting Georgia's sovereignty and its goal of joining NATO and the European Union. This comes amid alarming trends within the Georgian government, which has shown hostility toward independent civil society organizations and cooperation with Western allies.

The act proposes a comprehensive approach, including suspending the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission until democratic reforms are underway. It conceives a strategy for enhancing bilateral ties tailored to the current political context in Georgia, with a focus on upholding democratic values and rights.

Included in the proposed legislation is a plan for sanctions against Georgian officials involved in undermining democracy and those cooperating with foreign actors threatening Georgia's independence. The MEGOBARI Act further mandates reports on Russian influence within Georgia, assessing Kremlin activities and recommending measures to reinforce Georgia’s accountability and resilience.

This bill not only aims to protect U.S. interests but also reflects the growing urgency of ensuring democracy in a region increasingly threatened by external forces. The MEGOBARI Act highlights Congress's recognition of the critical geopolitical stakes involved and positions the U.S. as a staunch ally of Georgia in its quest for autonomy and democratic governance.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-IN, has introduced a significant piece of legislation proposing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would impose a federal debt limit. The measure seeks to cap the total amount of federal debt at 130% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), gradually reducing this limit to 120% over time, while also detailing strict conditions under which Congress could exceed this threshold.

The bill aims to address ongoing concerns regarding the nation’s rising debt levels, which have sparked debates among policymakers about fiscal responsibility and sustainability. Yakym's proposal emerged following a series of debt ceiling crises and urgent calls from constituents for a more structured approach to government spending. By limiting federal debt relative to economic performance, supporters argue that this amendment would help ensure future generations are not burdened with excessive debt.

Should the legislation pass, it would require a supermajority—three-fifths of both congressional houses—to authorize any debt above the established limit. Furthermore, the amendment allows for temporary waivers related to defense spending during declared wars or military conflicts, a provision aimed at balancing national security concerns with fiscal discipline.

While the bill has garnered attention for its ambitious goal of constitutional change, it stands as part of a wider conversation about fiscal policy and government accountability in the United States. As Yakym’s proposal moves to the House Judiciary Committee for further deliberation, key questions remain about the practical implications of enforcing such a constitutional change and its potential impact on federal financial operations in times of crisis.

The bill (H.R. 37) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, has introduced the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a legislative proposal aimed at allowing individuals with concealed carry permits from one state to carry concealed firearms in other states that permit such actions. The bill seeks to streamline existing laws governing concealment and reciprocity among states, creating a unified framework for gun owners traveling across state lines.

The primary goal of this legislation is to enhance the rights of gun owners by ensuring that state-specific concealed carry permits are recognized nationwide, as long as the owner is compliant with federal law. This proposal emerges against a backdrop of growing concerns about varying state gun laws, which can lead to confusion and legal issues for citizens traveling with firearms. Supporters argue that it promotes responsible gun ownership and self-defense measures, especially in an expanding culture of mobility where individuals frequently cross state boundaries.

The bill is expected to significantly impact law enforcement and regulatory frameworks, as it proposes that a valid photo ID and state-issued concealed carry permit would suffice for individuals to carry firearms in different jurisdictions. Notably, states would retain the authority to limit firearm possession in specific public areas, but the standardization of concealed carry permissions would represent a major shift in national regulations.

In context, the general public sentiment around firearm rights is deeply polarized, with advocates pushing for expanded rights while opponents emphasize safety and regulation. As the bill enters the legislative process, it will face scrutiny from both sides, highlighting the ongoing debates about gun rights, state authority, and public safety in the United States. Hudson's introduction of this bill reflects a continued effort by certain lawmakers to advance gun rights at the federal level, aiming for a cohesive legal approach to concealed carry across the nation.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Al Green, D-TX, has introduced the Honoring Our WWII Merchant Mariners Act of 2025, which aims to establish the Merchant Mariner Equity Compensation Fund. This legislation seeks to provide financial benefits to those who served in the United States merchant marine during World War II.

The bill comes in response to long-standing calls for recognition of the vital role played by merchant mariners during the war. Despite their contributions, these service members have historically been denied the same recognition and benefits afforded to regular military personnel. Under this proposed legislation, eligible individuals who served in the merchant marine or associated services between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946, can apply for a one-time payment of $25,000.

By creating this compensation fund, the bill seeks to rectify historical injustices faced by these veterans, many of whom are now in their advanced years. The legislation is expected to allocate $125 million for the fund, which will be administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The creation of this fund underscores a commitment to ensuring that all veterans receive the benefits they rightfully deserve, with streamlined application processes including acceptance of the DD-214 form as proof of service.

This initiative not only recognizes the merchant mariners' contributions but also reflects a broader push for equity within military benefits. As the number of World War II veterans dwindles, proponents of the bill argue that timely action is crucial. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and awaits further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 39) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-MA, has introduced the Commission to Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans Act, aimed at addressing the historical injustices of slavery and its lasting impacts on African Americans. The bill seeks to establish a commission tasked with studying the legacy of slavery, analyzing its ongoing effects, and making recommendations for reparations.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when discussions around racial justice and reparations have gained significant momentum across the country. Advocates argue that a formal acknowledgment of the harmful legacy of slavery is essential for healing and equality, making this legislation a pivotal step toward addressing systemic inequities faced by African Americans today. 

The proposed commission would evaluate a broad range of issues stemming from slavery, including economic disparities, educational inequities, and disproportionate incarceration rates. By forming a comprehensive understanding of these factors, supporters hope to encourage broad public dialogue and propose actionable remedies to redress historical wrongs.

Additionally, the bill highlights the necessity of recognizing that the impact of slavery and discrimination has persisted beyond its abolition, necessitating ongoing examination and reparative measures for affected communities. The commission is designed to compile evidence, engage in hearings, and ultimately provide Congress with a thorough report on its findings and suggested actions within 18 months of its formation.

This legislation, with its historical focus and contemporary significance, has garnered attention from a wide array of civil rights groups and may catalyze further discussions on economic and social justice in America. Rep. Pressley’s efforts reflect a growing consensus about the need for reparative justice as part of a broader commitment to equality and healing in the United States.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Nicholas Begich, R-AK, has introduced the Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition and Compensation Act, aimed at granting legal recognition and compensation to several Southeast Alaska Native communities previously omitted from the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). This legislation seeks to address long-standing grievances within the regions of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell.

The bill outlines provisions for these communities to form Urban Corporations, thereby allowing residents to manage land and resources as provided under ANCSA. By formally recognizing these communities, the act is designed to restore agency and rights previously denied, including access to lands and settlement funds. The establishment of Urban Corporations will empower local leaders to govern the companies that will manage the financial and natural resources of their respective areas.

Rep. Begich's initiative comes in response to ongoing concerns expressed by community members about their exclusion from both economic benefits and cultural recognition within the framework of federal law. The act is positioned to rectify historical oversights, potentially offering new economic opportunities through land development and resource management tailored to local needs.

The legislation is backed by extensive research showing that such recognition can lead to increased socioeconomic stability and cultural revitalization for these communities. It not only aims to address economic disparities but also serves as a step toward healing relationships between the federal government and these communities.

The act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, where it awaits further deliberation and possible amendments. If passed, this legislation could be a significant milestone in safeguarding the rights and fostering the growth of Alaska Native populations in the region.

The bill (H.R. 41) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Nicholas Begich, R-AK, has introduced the Alaska Native Settlement Trust Eligibility Act, aiming to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The bill seeks to ensure that payments to aged, blind, or disabled Alaska Natives, and their descendants, do not impact their eligibility for federal assistance programs.

The legislation addresses a critical issue faced by many Alaska Natives who rely on additional support due to age or disability. Previously, certain payments from settlement trusts were counted against eligibility for assistance programs, potentially disadvantaging vulnerable individuals. By clarifying the definitions and exclusions of these trusts, the bill intends to provide crucial financial safety nets for Alaska Natives who need them most.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions regarding the financial wellbeing of Native communities in Alaska. Historically, these communities have faced economic challenges, exacerbated by insufficient access to healthcare and social services. The proposed changes are anticipated to relieve pressure on many households, allowing beneficiaries to retain vital support while receiving trust distributions.

Further context reveals that this bill reflects a broader legislative trend towards recognizing and remedying disparities experienced by indigenous populations. As the U.S. government continues to reevaluate its approaches to Native American rights and resources, Rep. Begich’s initiative seeks to enhance stability and security for members of the Alaska Native community.

Following its introduction, the Alaska Native Settlement Trust Eligibility Act has garnered support from various advocates for indigenous rights, emphasizing the importance of tailored policies that address the unique needs of Alaska's Native peoples. With the bill having passed in the House, it now moves to the Senate for further consideration, marking a significant step toward improved equity for Alaska Natives.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Nicholas Begich, R-AK, has introduced the Alaska Native Village Municipal Lands Restoration Act, aimed at amending the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). This legislation seeks to relieve Village Corporations of the requirement to convey land in trust to the State of Alaska for the establishment of Municipal Corporations, a move intended to empower local governance and preserve Native land rights.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing discussions about the land rights of Alaska Natives and their governance. Historically, ANCSA facilitated the transfer of land to Native corporations, but the bill’s provisions have created challenges for local governance and land management. By enabling Village Corporations to retain ownership of their land without state intervention, the legislation aims to enhance community decision-making processes and ensure that local needs are prioritized over external control.

The potential impact of this bill is significant; it may provide a clearer path for economic development and community growth within Native villages. By preventing forced conveyance of land, the legislation promises to bolster the sovereignty of Indigenous communities, allowing them to govern their land according to their cultural practices and community needs.

This proposal comes at a time when many Native communities are reassessing their land management strategies and seeking to reclaim authority over local resources. As the bill advances, it will likely face scrutiny from various stakeholders, including state authorities and advocacy groups, prompting a broader conversation on land rights and local governance in Alaska. 

The Alaska Native Village Municipal Lands Restoration Act represents a pivotal step in recognizing Indigenous rights and fostering self-determination within Alaska’s Native communities.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Jack Bergman, R-MI, has introduced the Rural 340B Access Act of 2025, aimed at improving healthcare accessibility in rural communities by amending the Public Health Service Act. The legislation seeks to include rural emergency hospitals in the definition of a covered entity under the 340B drug discount program, expanding the reach of this crucial healthcare initiative.

The primary motivation behind the bill stems from the unique challenges rural healthcare facilities face. Many of these hospitals operate on thin margins, exacerbated by rising operational costs and limited patient bases. By allowing these institutions to participate in the 340B program, it is expected that they will gain access to discounted medications, ultimately enabling them to better serve low-income patients.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant. Rural emergency hospitals are often a lifeline for underserved populations who may not have access to more extensive health services. By extending 340B participation, the bill aims to alleviate some financial pressures on these facilities, which could lead to improved patient care and enhanced community health outcomes.

Historically, the 340B program has been a vital tool for urban healthcare facilities, yet rural entities have been sidelined from these benefits until now. The bill, which has garnered bipartisan support, reflects a collective recognition of the pressing need for equitable healthcare resources across the country.

As this legislation is debated in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, stakeholders, including healthcare advocates and rural hospital administrators, are hopeful that the Rural 340B Access Act will pave the way for more accessible healthcare services in rural America.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Jack Bergman, R-MI, has introduced the FIND Act, a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting the federal government from contracting with entities that engage in discrimination against the firearm and ammunition industry. This initiative seeks to ensure that federal contracts are awarded without bias against businesses within this sector.

The FIND Act was prompted by growing concerns among lawmakers about perceived discrimination against firearm-related businesses by financial institutions and companies in various sectors. Advocates for the legislation argue that such discrimination stifles economic opportunities for legitimate firearm enterprises and undermines the rights of law-abiding citizens to access firearms and related products. Proponents believe that ensuring equal treatment in federal contracting will enhance fairness and create a more competitive environment in the marketplace.

Under the proposed legislation, federal agencies would be required to include clauses in contracts that mandate prime contractors to certify that they do not discriminate against firearm entities or trade associations. The bill reinforces the notion that businesses should be judged on their merits rather than their industry affiliation. Failure to comply with these provisions could lead to contract cancellation and possible penalties for the offending contractor.

The potential impact of the FIND Act extends beyond governmental procurement practices. By solidifying protections for the firearm industry, it aims to bolster broader economic participation and acknowledge the rights of those engaged in legal firearm commerce. This measure has garnered support from numerous fellow lawmakers, reflecting a growing commitment to strengthening the protection of rights related to the firearms industry at the federal level. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Jack Bergman, R-MI, has introduced the Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity Act, aiming to expedite the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) processing of long-form applications under the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase II auction. This legislation seeks to enhance broadband access in rural areas by addressing challenges faced by service providers restricted by short construction seasons.  

The bill was motivated by the significant disparities in broadband availability across rural and urban areas, where many communities continue to lack essential high-speed internet access. The growing reliance on digital connectivity, exacerbated by recent shifts towards remote work and online education, underscores the urgency of ensuring equitable access. By prioritizing application reviews in regions with shorter construction seasons—often afflicted by harsh winters—the legislation aims to bolster the pace of broadband deployment where it is most needed.  

If enacted, the Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity Act could accelerate the deployment of high-speed internet services in underserved areas, fostering economic growth and improving educational opportunities for residents. Moreover, by removing bureaucratic delays, the bill supports a competitive landscape for service providers, potentially leading to improved service offerings and rates for consumers.  

The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund was established to promote broadband infrastructure development in economically disadvantaged regions. This new legislation, referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, seeks to align the FCC's priorities with the goal of leveling the playing field for long-form applicants. With growing recognition of the digital divide, lawmakers believe that enhancing broadband accessibility is crucial for national competitiveness and social equity. If successful, Rep. Bergman’s effort could serve as a significant step towards closing the digital gap in America.

The bill (H.R. 46) was introduced on 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Jack Bergman, R-MI, has introduced the VOICE Restoration Act, aiming to reinstate the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This legislative initiative seeks to provide dedicated support for victims of crimes committed by individuals present in the U.S. without legal status.

The re-establishment of the VOICE office is prompted by the previous termination of the program in June 2021, which aimed to assist victims impacted by crimes involving undocumented immigrants. The proposal highlights the importance of recognizing and aiding those who have suffered harm due to such crimes, signaling a renewed focus on victim support in immigration contexts. By addressing the needs of victims and their families, the legislation aims to provide resources, guidance, and assistance in navigating complex legal scenarios arising from these situations.

The VOICE Restoration Act outlines a range of support services, including the creation of a dedicated hotline for victims, access to social service professionals, and assistance in receiving critical information about the status of detained individuals. This initiative intends to foster cooperation between the VOICE office and community stakeholders to enhance outreach and support for affected individuals.

The proposed bill is set to enhance awareness surrounding available services for those victimized by crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, it emphasizes accountability by mandating quarterly reports to Congress detailing the program's impact on victims. With the introduction of the VOICE Restoration Act, Rep. Bergman aims to reinvigorate a dialogue on immigration-related crime, underscoring the necessity of a victim-centered approach within the broader framework of U.S. immigration policy.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act aiming to amend the Public Health Service Act. The legislation mandates that women seeking an abortion be provided with an ultrasound examination and the opportunity to review the images prior to giving informed consent for the procedure.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing national debates surrounding abortion and the rights of women in reproductive health decisions. Proponents argue that by requiring ultrasounds, women will have access to critical information about their pregnancies, which could lead to more informed choices. This legislation is expected to resonate particularly in states where laws regarding abortion are under stringent scrutiny.

If passed, the bill would enforce that any abortion provider must conduct an ultrasound, explain the results, and display the images to the woman receiving care. However, the measure does allow patients the right to avert their gaze from the displayed images if they choose, ensuring that the process respects personal comfort levels.

Supporters claim that this bill will enhance women's health decisions and promote informed consent, while critics warn that it could impose additional emotional burdens on women during a deeply personal time. The potential impact of this legislation extends beyond medical environments, as it reflects societal values and the political landscape concerning reproductive rights.

The Ultrasound Informed Consent Act has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further discussion. As lawmakers navigate public health implications and individual rights, Biggs’ proposal may spark significant dialogue in Congress and among constituents nationwide.

The bill (H.R. 48) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Crenshaw, Dan [R-TX-2] 01/03/2025; Rep. Burlison, Eric [R-MO-7] 01/03/2025; Rep. Crane, Elijah [R-AZ-2] 01/09/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No Pro-Abortion Task Force Act, legislation aimed at prohibiting the use of federal funds for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Reproductive Healthcare Access Task Force. This initiative stems from concerns among conservatives over federal involvement in promoting abortion access through task forces that they view as prioritizing pro-abortion agendas.

The bill seeks to address what Biggs and like-minded lawmakers perceive as an overreach by the federal government in healthcare policy. By preventing taxpayer dollars from being allocated to the HHS task force, which was announced in early 2022, the legislation aims to curtail federal support for reproductive health initiatives that involve abortion. Supporters argue that this move reflects the values of many American taxpayers who oppose the use of federal resources for abortion services.

If enacted, the law could significantly affect both the operations of the HHS task force and its ability to execute programs related to reproductive health access. Opponents of the bill may argue that it limits access to vital healthcare services and undermines efforts to address reproductive health needs across the country.

Background on the HHS Reproductive Healthcare Access Task Force reveals that it was established to enhance healthcare access, particularly for marginalized communities. However, the perception of its role has become contentious, sparking debate in Congress about the proper use of federal resources and the boundaries of government involvement in reproductive health.

As the No Pro-Abortion Task Force Act proceeds through the legislative process, it is expected to face challenges both from Democratic lawmakers and advocacy groups that support reproductive rights. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Keeping Aid for Municipalities And Localities Accountable Act, commonly referred to as the KAMALA Act. This new bill aims to restrict housing grants provided under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 by prohibiting their use to assist individuals who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

The KAMALA Act was introduced in light of ongoing concerns surrounding immigration and federal aid distribution. Proponents argue it is crucial to ensure that taxpayer-funded assistance does not benefit those who are not legally residing in the country. This legislative move follows increasing public sentiment favoring stricter immigration controls amid debates over resource allocation for various community programs.

If enacted, the KAMALA Act would specifically modify existing legislation to bar funding for any state, local government, or tribal entity that provides assistance to undocumented individuals. This change could significantly impact the operations of municipal and community development programs, particularly in states with larger immigrant populations. Critics of the bill fear that it may lead to reduced support for low-income families and exacerbate housing insecurity for vulnerable groups.

The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration. As discussions unfold, the bill will likely face scrutiny from both irate supporters advocating for immigration reform and opponents who recommend more inclusive support for all members of the community, regardless of their immigration status. The KAMALA Act reflects a significant ideological divide in current U.S. policy debates regarding immigration and social support systems.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, seeking to grant statehood to the nation’s capital. The proposed legislation aims to elevate Washington, D.C., known as the “Douglass Commonwealth,” to the status of the 51st state, thereby granting its residents equal voting rights in Congress and self-governance.

The introduction of the bill comes amidst ongoing debates about the political representation of D.C. residents, who currently lack voting representation in the House and Senate. Norton argues that granting statehood would rectify this inequity, allowing over 700,000 residents access to the same rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens in other states. 

If passed, the bill would initiate the admission process by establishing the necessary guidelines for electing two senators and one representative from D.C., set to take place following a presidential proclamation. The act also outlines the geographic boundaries of the proposed state, which would contain all of the current District of Columbia except for the federal properties, including the Capitol and the White House, designated as the Capital.

This legislation is supported by a significant number of Democratic lawmakers, reflecting a broad coalition advocating for D.C. statehood. Proponents argue that recognition of D.C. as a state would not only enhance democracy but also affirm the principle of equitable representation. 

The potential impacts of this bill are significant, notably increasing the House of Representatives to 436 members. Opponents, however, raise concerns about the implications of altering the federal seat of government, fearing that it might complicate governance in national security matters. As the bill moves to committee, discussions will likely intensify surrounding the future of Washington, D.C., and its constituents' rights.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Stop Woke Investing Act, designed to limit shareholder proposals pertaining to non-economic issues in corporate governance. The bill, unveiled on January 3, 2025, calls for reforms within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), requiring it to alter rules governing shareholder proposals presented in company proxy statements. 

The impetus behind this bill stems from growing concerns among conservative lawmakers that many companies are prioritizing social, political, or ideological goals over financial performance. By imposing restrictions on how many proposals can be submitted based on the size of the company—two for non-accelerated filers, four for accelerated filers, and seven for large accelerated filers—the act aims to streamline the proxy process and ensure that only those issues that substantially impact financial performance are considered. 

If passed, this legislation could significantly reshape corporate governance practices. The financial services industry, often a battleground for social issues, may experience heightened scrutiny and pressure to refocus their shareholder engagement strategies strictly on financial matters. Critics argue that such legislation may stifle important discussions around climate change and social justice, potentially limiting corporate accountability. 

The Stop Woke Investing Act adds to a growing trend among Republican lawmakers who are increasingly advocating for corporate policies that align with conservative values. As debates evolve over the role of corporations in social issues, the bill stands as an assertion of traditional investment principles focused solely on profitability and shareholder returns. It is now under review by the House Committee on Financial Services.

The bill (H.R. 52) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Ogles, Andrew [R-TN-5] [01/03/2025]; Rep. Crane, Elijah [R-AZ-2] [01/03/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Responsible Borrower Protection Act, aimed at canceling proposed changes to credit fees established by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The bill seeks to protect homeowners by maintaining the existing credit fee pricing framework, which is crucial for ensuring mortgage accessibility amid rising interest rates.

The legislation responds to recent adjustments to fees touted by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that were introduced in January 2023. Critics argue that these changes could disproportionately affect low-income borrowers, making it more difficult for them to secure affordable housing. With rising inflation already squeezing household budgets, any additional fee increases could exacerbate financial constraints for prospective homebuyers.

By proposing this legislation, Rep. Biggs aims to uphold risk-based pricing for credit fees while ensuring that these changes do not lead to inflated costs for families looking to purchase homes. The act is seen as an attempt to shield responsible borrowers who fulfill their mortgage obligations from unnecessary financial burdens that would likely arise from the proposed fee changes.

The Responsible Borrower Protection Act of 2025 brings together bipartisan support, as several co-sponsors include other prominent members from the Financial Services Committee. Should it pass, the act could significantly influence the mortgage market's landscape and affordability for buyers at a time when housing remains a critical concern for many Americans.

With the bill officially referred to the House Committee on Financial Services, lawmakers will begin deliberations on its implications for both the housing market and borrowers nationwide.

The bill (H.R. 53) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Ogles, Andrew [R-TN-5] 01/03/2025; Rep. Burlison, Eric [R-MO-7] 01/03/2025; Rep. Weber, Randy K. Sr. [R-TX-14] 01/03/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the WHO Withdrawal Act, aiming to direct the President to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) and restrict federal funding for participation in the organization. This legislation seeks to terminate the U.S. membership established under the constitution of the WHO due to concerns over its handling of public health crises and the sovereignty of member states.

The introduction of this bill stems from rising dissatisfaction among some lawmakers regarding WHO's responses to global health emergencies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argue that the organization's guidelines often infringe on national sovereignty, provoking calls for reassessment of the U.S. role in global health governance. With the pandemic exposing vulnerabilities in healthcare systems worldwide, the bill posits that a withdrawal from WHO might allow for a more independent American approach to public health policy.

If enacted, the bill would not only mandate the U.S. withdrawal but also prohibit any federal agency from using taxpayer dollars to support WHO or any successor organization. This could significantly alter the landscape of global health cooperation, especially considering that U.S. contributions have historically been substantial. Without these funds, WHO's capacity to respond to health emergencies may be hampered, raising concerns about the implications for global health management and disease mitigation efforts.

The WHO Withdrawal Act reflects a broader trend amongst some Republican lawmakers who are advocating for a more isolationist and nationally focused approach to international organizations. As it stands, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it will undergo further examination and potential modifications before any vote takes place.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced a bill aimed at repealing the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), a law designed to enhance voter registration processes across the United States. The bill, labeled as a measure to reduce federal involvement in state election systems, underscores growing partisan divisions over voting rights and election integrity.

The NVRA, often referred to as the Motor Voter Act, was established to simplify voter registration by allowing individuals to register to vote when applying for or renewing driver's licenses and certain welfare services. Proponents argue that it has significantly increased voter participation, especially among underrepresented groups. In contrast, critics, including Rep. Biggs, contend it facilitates voter fraud and undermines electoral integrity. They argue that states should have full control over their voting processes without federal mandates.

The introduction of this bill comes amid intensified debates over voting rights and election laws nationwide. Advocates for the repeal believe that it aligns with broader efforts to empower states to set their own voting regulations, potentially leading to stricter measures aimed at verification and accountability. 

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant. If passed, states would no longer be bound by the provisions of the NVRA, allowing them to determine their registration requirements independently. This shift may provoke states to adopt laws that could restrict access to voter registration, particularly affecting low-income individuals and minority voters who have benefited from enhanced access in the past.

As this bill progresses through Congress, it will likely encounter sharp opposition from Democrats and voting rights advocates, who see the NVRA as a critical tool for promoting civic engagement and ensuring fair access to the electoral process.

The bill (H.R. 55) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Perry, Scott [R-PA-10] [01/03/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Ending Catch and Release Act of 2025, a significant piece of legislation aimed at reforming current immigration practices, specifically those concerning asylum seekers. The bill proposes amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, explicitly prohibiting the parole or release of asylum applicants into the United States while their applications are pending.

The introduction of this bill aligns with ongoing debates regarding border security and immigration reform. Supporters argue that the current catch and release policies allow individuals who may pose a threat to evade detention, complicating the enforcement of immigration laws. By ensuring that asylum seekers remain detained or are returned to their countries of origin while their claims are considered, proponents believe it will enhance national security and reduce the burdens on the immigration court system.

This legislation could have far-reaching effects on the behavior of those considering illegal crossings into the U.S., potentially deterring individuals from seeking asylum under the current legal framework. Given the ongoing influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the bill aims to address perceived loopholes that many lawmakers believe have contributed to an ongoing crisis in immigration management.

As the bill progresses through the House Judiciary Committee, it will likely draw both support and opposition. Critics of stricter immigration policies express concerns about the humanitarian implications for asylum seekers, questioning the treatment of individuals fleeing violence and persecution. With the amendments proposed in the Ending Catch and Release Act, this legislative effort adds another layer to the national conversation surrounding immigration policies in the United States.

The bill (H.R. 57) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Mace, Nancy [R-SC-1] [01/03/2025]; Rep. Gill, Brandon [R-TX-26] [03/06/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Voter Integrity Protection Act aimed at tightening voting regulations for unlawful immigrants. The proposed legislation seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act by categorizing voting in federal elections by unlawfully present aliens as an aggravated felony, thereby strengthening enforcement measures against this activity.

The introduction of this bill is framed within a broader context of ongoing concerns regarding voter integrity and election security. Advocates argue that the legislation is necessary to uphold the sanctity of the voting process and deter potential abuses that could undermine public trust in elections. The bill highlights an increasing push among certain lawmakers to enhance penalties connected to voting offenses among non-citizens.

Key provisions of the act include amending existing federal laws to explicitly categorize unlawful voting as a deportable offense for non-citizens. This action is part of a larger trend where legislators are striving to ensure that all voters are citizens and legally eligible to participate in U.S. elections. If passed, this legislation could lead to heightened scrutiny of voter registrations, particularly in states with significant immigrant populations.

The introduction of the Voter Integrity Protection Act has sparked discussions regarding its potential implications. Critics express concern about the risk of disenfranchising eligible voters, particularly amidst fears that such measures could disproportionately affect lawful residents of immigrant backgrounds. As the bill moves through the legislative process, stakeholders on both sides of the aisle will be closely monitoring its developments as part of the national dialogue on immigration and electoral policies.

The bill (H.R. 58) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Mace, Nancy [R-SC-1] [01/03/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Mens Rea Reform Act, a legislative measure aimed at clarifying the mental state required for criminal convictions when such elements are not explicitly provided in laws. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, seeks to establish a standardized approach to determining culpability across various criminal offenses.

The introduction of this bill responds to ongoing concerns regarding the ambiguity of mental state requirements in federal statutes. Proponents believe that clearly defining the necessary mental state for a criminal offense can lead to fairer trials and better outcomes for defendants. By establishing a default standard that requires the government to prove a defendant acted knowingly unless otherwise specified, the bill aims to prevent wrongful convictions based on vague legal interpretations.

If enacted, the Mens Rea Reform Act would not only enhance transparency in the legal process but could also significantly impact future criminal prosecutions, making it harder to convict individuals on charges lacking clear specifications of intent. Legal experts view this reform as a crucial step toward promoting justice and ensuring that individuals are only prosecuted for crimes when their culpability is established beyond a reasonable doubt.

The bill comes amid a broader push for criminal justice reform, with advocates arguing that many laws allow for excessive penalties without sufficient consideration of a defendant's intent. As it moves to the House Judiciary Committee for further review, the Mens Rea Reform Act could redefine the landscape of federal criminal law, emphasizing the principle that an individual's mental state should be a fundamental component of prosecuting crimes.

The bill (H.R. 59) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Ogles, Andrew [R-TN-5] 01/03/2025; Rep. Roy, Chip [R-TX-21] 01/09/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Knife Owners' Protection Act, a bill aimed at safeguarding the rights of law-abiding citizens to transport knives across state lines. The legislation seeks to establish a uniform standard for knife transport, countering the existing patchwork of state and local laws that create confusion and potential legal consequences for knife owners.

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing concerns among knife enthusiasts and collectors about the legality of carrying knives while traveling. Currently, varying laws across states dictate different restrictions on knife types and their transport, leading to instances of unjust detainment or arrests. By proposing this legislation, Rep. Biggs hopes to eliminate these barriers and protect citizens from being penalized for simply possessing a knife, a common tool.

The Knife Owners' Protection Act specifically outlines that individuals will be able to transport knives from locations where they are legally owned to any place permissible, with provisions detailing safe storage during transport. This includes stipulations for keeping knives in locked containers or away from passenger compartments in motor vehicles, as well as conditions for air travel.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will enhance personal freedoms and provide clarity for knife owners who traverse state lines for various reasons, including work or recreation. Conversely, critics caution that the legislation might complicate efforts to regulate potentially dangerous weapons. 

As it stands, the bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration, and discussions surrounding its implications are anticipated in the coming weeks.

The bill (H.R. 60) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Ogles, Andrew [R-TN-5] [01/03/2025]; Rep. Moore, Barry [R-AL-1] [02/25/2025]; Rep. Gill, Brandon [R-TX-26] [03/06/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Ensuring United Families at the Border Act, aiming to amend provisions related to family detention within the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. The proposed legislation seeks to clarify the standards governing the detention of families at the U.S.-Mexico border, specifically focusing on parents who enter the country with their children.

The need for this bill arises from ongoing debates concerning the treatment of families in immigration detention facilities. By reinforcing legal standards for family detention, Rep. Biggs argues that the bill will maintain the integrity of family units while still addressing immigration laws. The proposed changes are particularly relevant as the government strives to balance immigration control with humane treatment of children and families.

Under the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security would be authorized to detain parents alongside their minor children when crossing the border unlawfully. The bill emphasizes that there will be no presumption against detaining accompanied minors, a shift that may influence how family units are processed during their time in detention. This legislative effort aims to streamline the current policies, which often face significant legal scrutiny regarding the care and custody of minors.

As immigration continues to be a contentious issue within the United States, support for this legislation may fluctuate along party lines. Advocates for stricter enforcement may view the bill as a necessary step, while opponents might express concerns over its implications for the rights of children and families. The Act is now being reviewed by the House Judiciary Committee, where it will undergo further discussion and possible amendments before moving forward.

The bill (H.R. 61) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Burlison, Eric [R-MO-7] 01/03/2025; Rep. Crane, Elijah [R-AZ-2] 01/03/2025; Rep. Nehls, Troy E. [R-TX-22] 01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Withholding Investments from Lawless Litigators In States Act, or the WILLIS Act, aimed at prohibiting federal funds from being allocated to the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office. This legislation reflects growing concerns among some lawmakers regarding the management and operations of certain district attorney offices, which they allege may be engaged in politically motivated prosecutions.

The bill's introduction comes in response to controversies surrounding the Fulton County D.A., particularly related to high-profile cases that critics argue are driven more by political agendas than legal merit. By cutting off federal funding, the lawmakers behind the bill assert that they are holding state entities accountable to higher standards of conduct and ethical governance. 

If enacted, the WILLIS Act would not only prevent new federal funds from being awarded but also mandate the recouping of past federal funding disbursed to the Fulton County District Attorney since January 1, 2021. Proponents argue that such measures are necessary to restore integrity within the legal system and ensure that taxpayer dollars are utilized appropriately. 

This move comes amidst a broader national dialogue on the role of district attorneys and their responsibilities, particularly concerning law enforcement practices that may reflect biases or politicization. Critics of the bill, however, argue it could undermine the autonomy of local law enforcement and hinder essential services, potentially impacting public safety in the area.

The WILLIS Act has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for review, marking the next step in what promises to be a contentious legislative process. As discussions continue, stakeholders from various sectors are expected to weigh in on the implications of this proposed legislation.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the ALVIN Act, designed to prohibit federal funding from being allocated to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. This legislation stipulates that any remaining federal funds due to the district attorney's office shall be rescinded, and efforts will be made to recoup any federal dollars spent since January 1, 2022.

The introduction of the ALVIN Act arises from concerns over the effectiveness and priorities of the Manhattan DA's office, particularly as crime rates have stirred significant public debate. Supporters of the bill argue that diminishing federal support could encourage local authorities to adopt more stringent law enforcement policies. They contend that the measure seeks to hold the Manhattan DA accountable for perceived leniency toward certain crime categories that have reportedly surged.

The potential repercussions of the ALVIN Act are significant. By cutting off federal funding, the bill could challenge the operational capabilities of the Manhattan DA's office, which relies on various federal grants and resources to support its activities. Critics argue this move may undermine public safety initiatives that depend on federal assistance, thereby sparking a broader conversation around funding and law enforcement strategies nationwide.

In recent years, the Manhattan DA's office has faced scrutiny over decisions made in high-profile cases and its overall approach to crime, creating a political battleground in New York and beyond. The ALVIN Act could set a precedent affecting how other jurisdictions approach federal funding and crime enforcement, particularly in urban areas grappling with similar challenges.

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration as it navigates the legislative process.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced Grant’s Law, legislation aimed at strengthening immigration enforcement by mandating the detention of aliens unlawfully present in the United States who are arrested for specific criminal offenses. This bill seeks to modify existing immigration laws to expand the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding the detention and removal of undocumented individuals linked to serious crimes.

Grant’s Law comes in response to growing concerns about public safety and illegal immigration. Proponents argue that by mandating detention for specific crimes, the bill will allow law enforcement to act decisively against individuals who pose a risk to society. The legislation stipulates that the Secretary of Homeland Security must detain any alien found unlawfully present in the U.S. if arrested for offenses deemed serious enough to warrant removal, thereby expediting the deportation process.

The potential impact of Grant’s Law could be significant, as it aligns with ongoing efforts to enhance border security and reduce crime associated with undocumented individuals. By ensuring quicker removal proceedings, which the bill mandates to be completed within 90 days of detention, the legislation aims to prevent lengthy legal battles that can prolong the presence of these individuals in the country.

While supporters tout the bill as a necessary tool for law enforcement, critics warn it may lead to overreach and unfair targeting of certain immigrant communities. They express concern that such measures could contribute to broader systemic issues within the immigration system and raise questions about the balance between public safety and civil rights.

The proposed legislation has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for consideration, where it will face scrutiny and debate. As conversations surrounding immigration continue to evolve, Grant’s Law underscores the legislative push towards stricter enforcement in the face of ongoing national debates over border control and public safety.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Armed Forces Endangered Species Exemption Act, a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. This bill intends to broaden exemptions for military operations concerning lands designated for national defense, allowing the Secretary of Defense greater latitude in using such lands without the constraints of the ESA.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing concerns from defense officials regarding critical habitat designations that may interfere with military training and operations. By reducing restrictions placed by the ESA, the legislation is positioned as necessary for ensuring national security and military preparedness, particularly in a time of heightened global tensions.

Under the proposed changes, certain military installations and identified lands used for defense-related purposes would not be categorized as critical habitats for endangered species. This could potentially lead to expanded military exercises without the environmental disruptions associated with ESA compliance. The implications of such a shift are significant; proponents argue it would enhance operational capabilities for the armed forces while detractors express concerns over the potential environmental consequences.

Historically, the Endangered Species Act has maintained robust protections for threatened and endangered species, often leading to tensions between conservation efforts and military needs. By amending the ESA, this bill seeks to balance these priorities, emphasizing national defense over ecological regulations in specific contexts. 

As this bill moves through the legislative process, it may ignite debates surrounding environmental preservation, military readiness, and the government's role in balancing these competing interests. The Armed Forces Endangered Species Exemption Act is now referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Federal Employee Student Debt Transparency Act aimed at increasing accountability among federal employees by requiring certain high-ranking officials to disclose their federal student loan debt. The legislation focuses on Senior Executive Service members and schedule C employees, mandating that they report their outstanding student loan balances annually.

This move comes amidst growing concerns over the federal student loan crisis, which has significantly impacted millions of Americans. Biggs contends that transparency in financial obligations for government officials is vital to ensure public trust. By making this information public, the act seeks to illuminate potential conflicts of interest or financial struggles that could affect decision-making processes—particularly in departments that may influence educational policies and financial regulations.

The bill mandates that eligible employees report their debt within 60 days of enactment and annually thereafter. It further stipulates that the Director of the Office of Government Ethics compile a report detailing the total amount owed by all covered employees and identify those who fail to comply with the reporting requirements. This requirement aims to foster a culture of accountability among federal employees while providing Congress with valuable data pertaining to federal loan debt.

The Federal Employee Student Debt Transparency Act reflects a growing policymakers' recognition of the need for transparency in government and aims to address public concerns regarding the financial integrity of civil service employees. As the bill progresses, it may set a precedent for similar legislation in other sectors, promoting fiscal responsibility among public servants nationwide.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Modernizing Retrospective Regulatory Review Act aimed at enhancing the review process for existing federal regulations. The legislation seeks to streamline regulatory frameworks by utilizing modern technology, including artificial intelligence, to assess and improve outdated or redundant regulations.

The initiative emerges in response to growing concerns about the bureaucratic inefficiencies within federal regulatory practices. Biggs emphasized that many current regulations have become obsolete, burdening businesses and complicating compliance. By implementing a structured retrospective review process, the bill aims to foster better regulatory efficiency and clarity while alleviating the pressures on agencies tasked with enforcing these regulations.

One of the primary goals of the proposed legislation is to mandate federal agencies to assess their regulations' availability in machine-readable formats, facilitating easier public access and analysis. The Office of Management and Budget will be tasked with providing guidance on integrating technology into the retrospective reviews, aiming for a review cycle that identifies regulations needing reevaluation due to ineffectiveness, inaccuracies, or unnecessary complexity.

Anticipated impacts of the Modernizing Retrospective Regulatory Review Act include reducing the regulatory burden on businesses, promoting transparency, and ensuring that regulations are not only up-to-date but also reflective of modern standards. As agencies start to implement the proposed changes, citizens and businesses alike may benefit from clearer regulations that better serve contemporary needs.

The bill is currently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will undergo further scrutiny and potential amendments. If successful, this legislation could reshape how federal regulatory reviews are conducted in the upcoming years, aligning them more closely with technological advancements and public needs.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Al Green, D-TX, has introduced the Housing Fairness Act of 2025 aimed at combating housing discrimination nationwide. The bill seeks to allocate funds for nationwide testing programs designed to detect and document unequal treatment in the housing market based on race, gender, and other protected statuses.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to increasing concerns about systemic housing discrimination in the United States, which has reportedly persisted despite existing laws. By implementing a comprehensive testing program, the bill intends to measure the prevalence of discriminatory practices in both rental markets and mortgage lending. Additionally, it aims to bolster the Fair Housing Initiatives Program by increasing funding, thus enabling organizations dedicated to enforcing fair housing laws to enhance their outreach and educational efforts.

The Housing Fairness Act is designed not only to expose unfair practices but also to facilitate concrete legislative and administrative action in response to identified issues. The bill requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to collaborate with qualified fair housing organizations to carry out these testing initiatives, ensuring that the process is effective and transparent.

Moreover, experts anticipate that the funding provisions outlined in the bill could significantly enhance the capacity of local organizations to provide support to individuals facing housing discrimination. It is believed that a more robust enforcement framework could lead to better compliance with fair housing laws, ultimately fostering a more equitable housing landscape.

With bipartisan support likely needed for passage, the Housing Fairness Act of 2025 represents a proactive effort by Rep. Green to address longstanding issues in the housing sector and protect vulnerable populations against discrimination. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the “Freedom to Petition the Government Act,” aimed at easing the regulatory burden on nonprofit organizations holding meetings with federal officials in Washington, D.C. The bill proposes that such meetings, conducted on federal property, will not require these organizations to register as doing business in the district, which currently complicates their interactions with lawmakers.

The introduction of this legislation comes in light of ongoing concerns from nonprofit groups regarding the complexities of federal registration and compliance, which can hinder their ability to engage effectively with government representatives. Many organizations believe that the current rules create unnecessary barriers to their advocacy efforts and limit their capacity to influence public policy directly.

If enacted, the Freedom to Petition the Government Act would amend the District of Columbia Official Code. This change would clarify that meetings held at federal facilities will not count as business activity, thus exempting many nonprofits from the burdensome registration requirements. Supporters of the bill argue that this initiative will enhance transparency and encourage open dialogue between government and civil society entities.

By simplifying regulations, this legislation is expected to foster greater collaboration between nonprofits and government officials, potentially leading to more informed legislative decisions. Nonprofits often play a crucial role in representing diverse community interests; therefore, facilitating their access to lawmakers is seen as a vital step in enhancing democratic engagement. 

The bill was introduced on January 3, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. Supporters hope that swift passage can ensure that nonprofits can operate without unnecessary regulatory hindrances while advocating for their causes in the nation’s capital.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No SmartPay for Anti-2A Companies Act, legislation aimed at prohibiting the Administrator of General Services from awarding contracts under the SmartPay Program to any commercial payment systems that utilize a merchant category code for gun retailers. This bill seeks to reinforce Second Amendment rights by restricting how federal contracts are awarded concerning companies perceived as adversarial to gun ownership.

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing scrutiny of financial systems that categorize gun retailers through specific merchant codes. Proponents argue that such classifications could enable discrimination against gun retailers and impede lawful purchases, thereby infringing on the rights of gun owners. By prohibiting government contracts with payment processors using these codes, Biggs aims to protect both individual rights and the gun industry, fostering a more favorable business environment for gun-related commerce.

If passed, the bill would apply to future contracts and will not affect any existing agreements signed prior to its enactment. This legislative move reflects a growing wave of political momentum among conservative lawmakers who advocate for robust protection of Second Amendment freedoms amid rising regulatory scrutiny of the firearms industry.

As discussions around gun rights and financial tracking continue to evolve, the No SmartPay for Anti-2A Companies Act contributes to the ongoing national dialogue about government overreach and individual liberties.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Veterans Health Care Freedom Act, a legislative proposal designed to enhance veterans' access to medical care through a new pilot program. This initiative aims to allow eligible veterans the ability to select their health care providers both within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system and in the community.

The bill responds to ongoing concerns about accessibility and inefficiencies in veteran health care. Advocates argue that by enabling veterans to choose their providers, the legislation could yield improved health outcomes and a more satisfactory care experience. It establishes a framework in which the VA Secretary will oversee a pilot program implemented across at least four Veterans Integrated Service Networks, ensuring coverage in diverse geographic areas, including both urban and rural settings.

Should enacted, the act would eliminate certain existing requirements that restrict veterans from receiving care at facilities outside their designated service networks. This flexibility is intended to streamline the process of obtaining necessary medical services and to empower veterans in managing their health care needs. Moreover, it is anticipated that the program will increase competition among providers, potentially driving down costs and improving service quality.

In addition to its immediate objectives, the Veterans Health Care Freedom Act lays down a pathway for broader reforms. If successful, the pilot program could lead to long-term legislative changes, including permanent alterations to the VA’s care delivery system, set to take effect four years post-enactment. This reform has garnered support from various veteran advocacy groups, reflecting a growing consensus on the need for enhanced health care options for those who have served in the military. The bill is currently under consideration by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the TBI and PTSD Treatment Act aimed at providing veterans suffering from traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) access to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This legislation seeks to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to ensure that veterans can receive this specialized treatment through authorized healthcare providers.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns over the effectiveness of traditional treatments for veterans facing debilitating mental and physical health challenges. By offering hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which has shown promise in aiding recovery from brain injuries and alleviating PTSD symptoms, the act aims to enhance therapeutic options for veterans, many of whom struggle to reintegrate into civilian life.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized environment and has been linked to improved cognitive function and reduced symptoms in individuals with brain injuries. With an increasing number of veterans reporting these conditions, the treatment could provide much-needed relief and support during their recovery process.

The legislation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that veterans have access to innovative therapies that can significantly affect their wellbeing. Supporters argue that by diversifying treatment options, the bill can potentially reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals and mitigate the long-term effects of TBI and PTSD. 

The TBI and PTSD Treatment Act has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for review, where it will undergo further scrutiny before moving to additional stages of the legislative process. This initiative reflects a broader commitment to improving health outcomes for veterans and addressing the unique challenges they face after service.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the “Abortion Is Not Health Care Act of 2025,” which aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code by excluding abortion-related expenses from eligibility for medical expense deductions. This legislative effort reflects ongoing national debates regarding the categorization of abortion in healthcare discussions.

The bill seeks to clarify that any amounts paid for abortions cannot be included when taxpayers calculate their medical expense deductions. This position aligns with broader initiatives supported by many conservative lawmakers who argue against classifying abortions as a health care necessity, thus impacting related tax benefits for individuals who might seek or undergo such procedures.

Biggs' legislation is noteworthy amid a backdrop of intensified political scrutiny on reproductive rights, following significant changes to state-level abortion laws across the country. It aims to deter federal support or financial relief for abortion services by removing the option for individuals to claim such expenses as tax-deductible, which could ultimately affect access for those relying on these tax benefits during challenging economic times.

Proponents of the bill believe it will safeguard taxpayer funds from being utilized in ways that they consider contrary to the moral and ethical implications surrounding abortion. Critics, however, argue that the bill fails to recognize the complexities of women’s health care needs and the necessity of ensuring access to safe and legal abortion services.

As this bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means for consideration, it represents one of the many legislative efforts aimed at reshaping the landscape of reproductive health care and taxation in the United States. Observers anticipate spirited discussions as similar bills have faced significant opposition in previous sessions, reflecting the polarized nature of this issue across the nation.

The bill (H.R. 73) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Allen, Rick W. [R-GA-12]...01/03/2025; Rep. Moore, Barry [R-AL-1]...01/03/2025; Rep. Joyce, John [R-PA-13]...01/03/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Freedom for Families Act, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to enhance financial support for families during medical or caregiving situations. This legislation seeks to allow tax-advantaged distributions from health savings accounts (HSAs) specifically for those on family or medical leave.

The impetus for this bill arises from the growing realization of the financial strain that caregiving can place on families, particularly in cases of serious health issues or childbirth. By enabling families to access their HSAs without incurring additional tax penalties, the Freedom for Families Act aims to provide much-needed flexibility during critical times. This change is expected to alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with taking time off work to care for family members.

In addition to expanding the use of HSAs, the bill proposes changes to existing regulations by removing the high-deductible health plan requirement, which currently limits access to these accounts. This move could significantly broaden eligibility and increase overall contributions to HSAs, empowering families to save more for healthcare-related expenses.

The potential impact of the Freedom for Families Act is substantial. If passed, it could enhance financial security for millions of Americans facing caregiving responsibilities. The proposed changes align with broader efforts to support family health and well-being by facilitating easier access to resources when they're needed most.

The act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it may garner bipartisan support, reflecting the urgent need to assist families balancing the demands of work and caregiving.

The bill (H.R. 74) introduced on 01/03/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Burlison, Eric [R-MO-7] [01/03/2025].

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act, aimed at establishing a dedicated fund to secure the southern border of the United States. The proposed legislation seeks to allocate financial resources for the planning, construction, and maintenance of a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill was introduced amid growing concerns over rising illegal immigration and border security deficiencies. By creating a Secure the Southern Border Fund, the bill intends to streamline funding for border security initiatives, making it easier for the federal government to address these pressing issues. The legislation proposes to allow funds for maintaining vehicles and equipment for U.S. Border Patrol agents, though it mandates that only 5% of the fund may be used for such purposes.

Key provisions of the bill require annual reporting on apprehensions of undocumented immigrants attempting to cross the border, along with a detailed account of their nationalities. Furthermore, the bill outlines that foreign aid to nations with high numbers of border-crossers could be reduced, reflecting a stricter approach to immigration policies.

In addition to financial allocations, the act also emphasizes the necessity of constructing physical barriers to prevent illegal crossings by 2025. The bill grants the Secretary of Homeland Security broad authority to waive legal requirements to expedite construction efforts.

As debates about immigration reform intensify, this legislation signifies a clear shift towards prioritizing border security among Republican lawmakers. The proposed act is expected to prompt significant discussions in Congress on how best to approach the ongoing challenges surrounding immigration and national security. The bill has been referred to multiple committees, where it will undergo further scrutiny.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Midnight Rules Relief Act, aimed at addressing the practice of midnight rules enacted by outgoing administrations. This legislation seeks to streamline the process through which Congress can disapprove last-minute regulations issued in the final year of a president's term.

The Midnight Rules Relief Act comes as a response to concerns that such regulations, often pushed through without adequate oversight, can impose significant restrictions on industries and shape policy in ways that do not reflect the electorate's will. By enabling en bloc consideration of multiple disapproval resolutions, the bill would allow Congress to collectively reject a series of rules, rather than navigating each separately, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

The potential impact of this legislation is substantial, particularly for businesses and stakeholders who often grapple with abrupt regulatory changes. Advocates argue that it would enhance transparency and accountability within the regulatory process, ensuring that new rules undergoing scrutiny are subject to appropriate congressional review. Critics, however, may view it as an effort to weaken critical regulatory frameworks that protect public interests.

Historically, midnight regulations have been a contentious issue, with various administrations employing them as a tool to solidify their legacies. This bill, now passed by the House with a narrow 212-208 vote, is anticipated to provoke further debate as it moves to the Senate, where discussions about regulatory authority and administrative power will likely intensify. By facilitating Congressional oversight of such rules, the Midnight Rules Relief Act underscores the ongoing tension between legislative power and executive action in the political landscape.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act, a bill aimed at regulating abortion procedures and enhancing safety standards for abortion clinics. The proposed legislation seeks to amend Title 18 of the United States Code, establishing new requirements for physicians performing abortions and operational guidelines for clinics.

The introduction of this bill follows rising concerns among some lawmakers about the safety and regulation of abortion services. Proponents argue that ensuring physicians have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandating that clinics meet certain ambulatory surgery center standards will significantly improve health outcomes for women undergoing these procedures. Advocates assert that the new regulations will provide necessary follow-up care in case of complications after an abortion, ultimately prioritizing patient safety.

The impact of the Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act could be extensive, potentially reshaping how abortion services are offered across the country. By imposing stringent operational criteria on clinics and requiring physicians to comply with notification and care standards, the bill aims to reduce risks associated with abortions. Critics, however, contend that these regulations may create barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services.

This legislative initiative is part of a broader national conversation regarding reproductive rights and healthcare access in the United States. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will face scrutiny from various advocacy groups, which will weigh in on its implications for women's health rights. The measure has been referred to the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees for further consideration, where its provisions will be debated and amended before any potential voting takes place.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Freedom from Mandates Act, a legislation aimed at nullifying existing COVID-19 vaccine mandates and preventing future federal requirements for vaccination against the virus. The bill specifically seeks to override executive orders and regulations that impose these mandates on federal employees and contractors.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing debates regarding federal authority and public health policies. Advocates for the bill assert that it protects individual freedoms and choices regarding vaccination, arguing that mandates infringe on personal rights. This legislative move comes amidst a backdrop of divided opinions on vaccine mandates across the United States, with many citizens expressing concerns about government overreach and personal autonomy.

Should this bill pass, it could significantly impact employers and healthcare providers. It prohibits the Secretary of Labor from enforcing any rules requiring vaccinations among employees. Furthermore, it bars Medicare and Medicaid from mandating vaccinations for healthcare providers as a condition for participation in these programs. This could lead to changes in how federal health agencies approach vaccination requirements, possibly forcing them to adopt more lenient policies in response to public sentiment.

This legislation is part of a broader trend among some lawmakers who aim to limit the federal government’s ability to impose health-related mandates. As public discourse continues, the Freedom from Mandates Act could become a focal point for discussions about the balance between public health and individual freedoms in the U.S. The bill has been referred to multiple committees, including Oversight and Government Reform and Education and Workforce, for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Drain the Intelligence Community Swamp Act, aiming to revoke security clearances for certain former intelligence officials involved in the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. This legislation adds a layer of scrutiny to the actions of these individuals during a contentious political period.

The bill was introduced amid ongoing debates regarding the integrity and accountability of the intelligence community. Proponents argue that former officials should not maintain their security clearances if they are viewed as having compromised their impartiality, particularly concerning political matters. The legislation targets specific individuals who signed a public statement related to the Hunter Biden emails, asserting that their continued access to classified information may represent a conflict of interest.

If enacted, the bill mandates the immediate revocation of security clearances for the named individuals and calls for comprehensive investigations by the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General. Such investigations would focus on these former officials’ involvement in the Biden campaign and their overall conduct during the 2020 elections. The move is seen as a step towards increasing transparency and restoring public trust in the intelligence community.

This proposal reflects a broader trend among certain lawmakers to impose stricter regulations on former government officials, particularly those tied to controversial political events. By targeting previous intelligence officials, supporters believe the bill could deter similar future conduct and ensure that national security interests remain paramount.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, its potential implications extend beyond security clearances, as it may also affect the political landscape surrounding accountability in the intelligence sector.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced legislation aimed at repealing federal mask mandates for public transportation, signaling a significant shift in the management of COVID-19 health protocols in America. The Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2025 seeks to remove existing requirements for individuals to wear face masks on various forms of conveyances and at transportation hubs, asserting that federal agencies should not impose such mandates.

The bill comes in response to growing frustrations among the public over masking requirements, particularly as many states have moved to relax COVID-19 restrictions. Proponents argue that individuals should retain the freedom to make their own health choices without federal government interference. By eliminating requirements established during the pandemic, advocates of the legislation believe it will restore normalcy in travel and reinforce personal liberties.

Should this bill pass, it will nullify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) current mandates regarding mask-wearing while on public transport and in transportation hubs, which were put in place to mitigate the spread of the virus. The potential impact of this legislation is substantial, as it may pave the way for a broader easing of health regulations and encourage a faster return to pre-pandemic conditions within the travel industry.

Biggs' proposal has garnered attention in the House, where it has been referred to the relevant committees for further review. As the nation continues to navigate the complexities of post-pandemic life, the travel mask mandate repeal could signal a pivotal moment in evolving public health policy and individual rights regarding health and safety measures.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Defund National Endowment for the Humanities Act, aiming to prohibit the use of federal funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for specific expenditures mandated by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965. 

The bill seeks to cut off funding for activities that some lawmakers contend do not align with contemporary public sentiment or cultural values. By targeting section 7 of the existing legislation, the proposed law aims to ensure that taxpayer money is not used for programs deemed unnecessary or divisive. Advocates of the bill argue that federal support for the humanities should be reconsidered in light of budget constraints and national priorities.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing debates in Congress over the role of government in funding arts and humanities programs. Proponents believe it reflects a growing skepticism regarding the efficacy of federal spending in this area, especially as many Americans face economic hardships. Conversely, opponents warn that defunding the NEH could undermine public access to cultural resources and education in the arts, ultimately harming communities and educational institutions that rely on such support.

The NEH has historically provided grants for projects that enhance cultural understanding and preservation across the United States. As this bill moves to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for review, its proponents and opponents are expected to engage in heated discussions regarding the future of federal support for the humanities. The outcome of this legislative effort could significantly impact funding allocations and the broader discussion about the arts in America.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Ending Common Core and Expanding School Choice Act, aiming to dismantle the federally mandated Common Core standards while promoting increased school choice for low-income students. This legislation seeks to allow federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children to follow them to their chosen educational institutions, whether public schools, charter schools, or accredited private schools.

The bill was designed amidst growing criticism of the Common Core State Standards, viewed by many as a federal overreach into education policy. Biggs argues that personalized learning options cater better to students’ unique needs, allowing families more autonomy in selecting educational pathways. Under this proposal, states would be empowered to allocate federal funds according to each child’s individual educational expenses, fostering an environment of choice and competition among schools.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant. If passed, it would not only provide financial support for low-income families seeking diverse educational opportunities but also attempt to decentralize the control of education standards from the federal level to individual states. Proponents believe that this flexibility will enhance educational outcomes and satisfaction among families, particularly in underserved communities.

Historically, education funding has typically been tied to specific standards and accountability measures under federal law. By enabling funds to be diverted for various educational-related expenses, including tuition for private schools and educational services, this bill may redefine how public education is financed in the U.S. The measure has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further consideration, and its progression will depend on a broader consensus among lawmakers about the direction of U.S. educational policy.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Native American Education Opportunity Act aimed at expanding educational choices for Native American children. The proposed legislation seeks to establish education savings accounts that provide funding for various educational expenses, empowering tribes to offer tailored educational opportunities within their communities.

The bill was introduced in response to long-standing challenges faced by Native American students, including limited access to quality educational options and resources. It aims to enhance educational outcomes by allowing tribal governments to administer funds that can be used for tutoring, private school tuition, and materials for both in-person and online learning. By doing so, the legislation promotes cultural preservation and academic achievement among Native American youth.

Key provisions of the act include the establishment of a structured framework for education savings accounts, which grants tribes the autonomy to manage and allocate funds. Each eligible student would receive an annual amount to support their educational needs, fostering an environment where families can choose options that best fit their children’s learning styles. The act also allows tribes to collaborate with non-profit organizations to ensure efficient program management.

The introduction of this bill is significant for confronting educational disparities affecting Native American populations. Proponents argue that these measures can lead to better engagement and performance in education, cultivating a new generation of leaders. As the bill moves forward, its potential impact on educational policy may prompt discussions about broader reforms aimed at increasing equity within Indigenous education systems across the country.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Small Business Flexibility Act, aimed at enhancing the operational flexibility of small businesses in the hospitality industry. The bill seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by allowing for the pooling of tips among all employees, which could potentially foster equitable earnings distribution and improve workplace morale.

The rationale behind the introduction of this bill stems from challenges many small businesses face, particularly in maintaining competitive wages amid rising operational costs. By implementing a tip pooling system, employees who typically do not receive tips, such as support staff, can benefit from the earnings generated by customer gratuities. This not only enhances income stability for all employees but may also help small businesses retain talent in a competitive labor market.

The potential impact of the Small Business Flexibility Act could be significant, especially for establishments where teamwork is essential for customer satisfaction. By allowing for tip sharing, the bill promotes a collaborative environment where all employees contribute to and benefit from the success of the business. It could particularly benefit restaurants and bars, where staff often work closely together in providing service.

This legislative initiative aligns with growing calls for reforms in labor laws to better reflect the realities of modern work environments, especially in industries heavily reliant on tipped wages. Supporters argue that such changes could represent a much-needed update to federal labor laws that have remained largely unchanged for decades, positioning small businesses for greater economic success as they adapt to evolving consumer preferences and labor market challenges. The bill is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Education and Workforce.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Nullify Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act, known as the NOSHA Act, aiming to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) established in 1970. The proposed legislation seeks to eliminate federal oversight in workplace safety, which supporters argue will reduce regulatory burdens on businesses across the country.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing debates regarding the effectiveness and necessity of OSHA regulations. Proponents of the NOSHA Act assert that the agency has imposed excessive regulations that hinder business growth and job creation, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Their position reflects a broader shift towards favoring less government intervention in the private sector.

If enacted, the NOSHA Act would repeal the Occupational Safety and Health Act, effectively dismantling OSHA and transferring responsibility for workplace safety to individual states and private organizations. This change could significantly impact how safety standards are developed and enforced in various industries, potentially leading to a patchwork of regulations across the country. Critics, however, are concerned that without a centralized federal authority, workplace safety may decline, endangering workers who could be inadequately protected under a state-based system.

The proposed bill is in line with other Republican efforts to roll back federal regulations. As it stands, the NOSHA Act has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further review. Advocates and opponents of the legislation are expected to engage in robust discussions as lawmakers weigh the potential implications for worker safety and business operations across the nation. As the debate unfolds, the NOSHA Act will likely remain a focal point in the broader conversation about government regulation and workplace safety standards moving forward.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Protecting Our Children from the CDC Act, a bill aimed at altering the inclusion process for COVID-19 vaccines in the child and adolescent immunization schedule. The proposed legislation stipulates that no vaccine can be added to this schedule unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services publicly posts all clinical data concerning the vaccine's safety and efficacy on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) website.

The impetus for this bill stems from ongoing concerns surrounding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for younger populations. Many parents and health advocates have expressed apprehensions about vaccine side effects and the transparency of the data supporting their use. This legislation is intended to provide greater access to information, thereby allowing parents to make more informed decisions regarding their children’s vaccinations.

Should this bill be enacted, it would require the Department of Health and Human Services to disclose all relevant clinical data before any COVID-19 vaccine could be included in the immunization schedule for young people. Additionally, any vaccine currently listed would be removed until the required data is made accessible. This can fundamentally alter how the CDC and health authorities implement vaccination strategies for children, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of vaccine approval processes.

As this bill progresses through Congress, its implications could have far-reaching effects not just on public health policy, but also on parental trust in health organizations. The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Medical Innovation Acceleration Act, aimed at revolutionizing the landscape of medical diagnostics by exempting non-invasive diagnostic devices from the stringent regulations set forth in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

The primary purpose of this bill is to facilitate the development and use of innovative, non-invasive diagnostic tools that do not penetrate the skin or otherwise intrude into the body. By removing regulatory barriers, proponents believe the legislation could spark advancements in medical technology, ultimately leading to quicker and cheaper diagnostic solutions that improve patient outcomes.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing calls from healthcare professionals and technologists for regulatory reforms that allow for more rapid innovation in the medical device sector. There is significant recognition that non-invasive devices can enhance early detection of diseases, contributing to more effective treatments and better healthcare management. By loosening regulatory restrictions, Rep. Biggs aims to encourage investment in innovative health technologies, particularly in an era where rapid medical advancements are imperative.

The potential impact of the Medical Innovation Acceleration Act could be extensive. It may promote not only growth in the medical technology sector but also enhance accessibility for patients by lowering the costs associated with diagnostic tests. With a clearer pathway for innovation, the bill stands to alter the competitive landscape of medical devices to benefit both developers and consumers.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Prescription Freedom Act, a bill aiming to repeal the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) authority to require prescriptions for certain drugs. This significant legislative move intends to ease access to medications by allowing them to be dispensed without a prescription.

The motivation behind the bill stems from ongoing concerns about prescription medication accessibility, particularly for patients who face barriers to obtaining necessary treatments. By eliminating prescription requirements, the bill aims to empower individuals to take charge of their health care decisions, potentially reducing dependency on health care providers for basic medications.

The potential impact of this legislation is substantial. Advocates argue that it could lead to increased medication accessibility for chronic conditions, justifying a more consumer-driven approach to health care. However, critics express concerns over the potential risks associated with unsupervised access to drugs that traditionally require medical oversight. They argue that the prescription system was designed to ensure patient safety and address necessary medical evaluations before medication is dispensed.

The Prescription Freedom Act is set against a backdrop of increasing public demand for more direct access to health care services and medications, particularly in light of rising drug prices and an ongoing debate about health care reform. It has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

As the bill progresses through Congress, it will likely ignite discussions on balancing consumer rights with the safeguarding of public health, making its reception a critical focal point for lawmakers and constituents alike during this legislative session.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Health Coverage Choice Act aimed at redefining short-term limited duration insurance within the Public Health Service Act. This legislation seeks to provide a clear framework for insurance offerings that are often utilized by individuals seeking temporary health coverage.

The Health Coverage Choice Act was introduced in response to growing concerns about insurance options available to Americans, especially those in transition, such as recent graduates or individuals changing jobs. By offering a definition for short-term limited duration insurance, the bill aims to bring clarity rather than confusion in the health insurance market, ensuring that consumers understand their choices.

This bill's potential impact could be significant, especially for those who find themselves without continuous healthcare coverage but need short-term solutions. It allows for plans that last up to three years, which is an extension from the current understanding, thus giving individuals more flexibility in managing their health insurance needs during transitional periods. The act aims to ensure that basic healthcare services remain accessible and affordable, which could ultimately lead to better health outcomes for these individuals.

The context of this legislative move aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress about health care reform and insurance accessibility. By framing short-term plans more distinctly, lawmakers hope to strike a balance between affordability and comprehensive coverage without compromising consumer protections. As the bill progresses through the House, it will be scrutinized in depth by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which will evaluate its implications for the broader health insurance landscape.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Freedom for Farmers Act, a legislation aimed at abolishing the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The bill proposes a transition of its functions to a different agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, claiming that this change will enhance the management of regulations related to toxic substances and their health implications.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about federal efficiency and regulatory oversight. Advocates argue that the existing structure of the ATSDR has hindered timely responses and effective monitoring of public health risks associated with toxic exposure. Biggs believes that dismantling the ATSDR will streamline operations and allow for a more focused approach to environmental health concerns, potentially benefiting farmers and communities affected by toxic substances.

If passed, the Freedom for Farmers Act not only seeks to eliminate the ATSDR but also to transfer its duties, including the oversight of disease registries previously managed by the agency. This would lead to a fundamental restructuring of how the government handles reports and responses to toxic substance exposure, aiming to improve community health outcomes.

As part of the legislative process, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. This step signifies the beginning of discussions that could lead to amendments and potential opposition from various stakeholders, including health advocacy groups concerned about the impacts of deregulating toxic exposure management.

The Freedom for Farmers Act has sparked a debate on whether the elimination of the ATSDR could lead to greater public safety or if it poses risks of insufficient oversight in addressing public health emergencies stemming from toxic substances. For now, it remains to be seen how this proposed legislation will evolve in Congress.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Strategic Production Response and Implementation Act, a legislative effort aimed at increasing oil and gas production from federal lands in response to energy supply challenges. This proposed bill seeks to synchronize the drawdown of petroleum reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with the further development of domestic energy resources.

The bill emerges against a backdrop of fluctuating energy prices and concerns about energy security within the United States. With recent supply interruptions highlighting vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy framework, Rep. Biggs asserts the need to enhance domestic production capabilities. By calling for a compensatory increase in federal oil and gas leases, the act aims to ensure that any reductions in reserve levels are matched with increased output from public lands.

Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Energy is tasked with formulating a plan to ramp up oil and gas leasing on federal lands controlled by various government departments, including Agriculture, Energy, and the Interior. The act stipulates that this increase should not exceed 10% of the total land currently leased for oil and gas development. Furthermore, the plan must be developed in consultation with the relevant secretaries to ensure a cohesive approach to energy production and environmental stewardship.

The Strategic Production Response and Implementation Act highlights a continuing bipartisan dialogue on energy independence. It seeks to bolster domestic energy output while managing strategic resources responsibly, potentially impacting both economic stability and energy policy in the years ahead. As this bill moves through Congress, further discussions will examine its implications for national energy strategy and environmental protections.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Stop Imposing Woke Ideology Abroad Act with the intention of prohibiting federal funding for the Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice within the Department of State. The legislation aims to curb resources allocated to initiatives that the bill’s proponents label as woke ideologies and seeks to reorient diplomatic efforts away from perceived social justice frameworks.

The introduction of this bill comes amid escalating debates about the appropriateness of incorporating social equity principles within U.S. foreign policy. Proponents argue that such frameworks detract from vital U.S. interests abroad, while opponents claim that embracing principles of equity and justice is crucial for effective diplomacy. The act explicitly seeks to prevent any federal funds from being used for the salary and expenses of the Special Representative, as well as any actions associated with the Department of State’s Equity Action Plan.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it may reshape how U.S. foreign affairs agencies approach issues related to race and equity. By limiting financial resources for positions and policies deemed overly political or ideological, the bill aims to refocus diplomatic resources on traditional security and economic interests. Critics warn that this approach might undermine efforts to address systemic inequalities globally and damage U.S. credibility on human rights issues.

Overall, the Stop Imposing Woke Ideology Abroad Act reflects a growing trend among some lawmakers to resist the integration of social justice initiatives into governmental policies, signaling substantial shifts in U.S. diplomacy as the 119th Congress begins its session. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, recently introduced a bill aimed at terminating the designation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally. This legislation, if enacted, would mark a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding Pakistan, reflecting concerns over its continued military operations and links to militant groups.

The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, comes amid escalating tensions and critiques of Pakistan’s military actions, particularly regarding the Haqqani Network, a group classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S. The rationale behind this legislative action is rooted in calls for accountability. Lawmakers are increasingly dissatisfied with whether Pakistan has taken adequate steps to address the threats posed by extremist factions operating within its borders.

If passed, the bill not only revokes Pakistan's status but also stipulates that any future designation would require a presidential certification that Pakistan substantially disrupts the operations of the Haqqani Network and cooperates with Afghanistan in curbing cross-border militant activities. Critics argue that dropping this designation could weaken U.S. leverage in the region and disrupt cooperative efforts against terrorism.

This legislative move arrives at a crucial time when the Biden administration is reassessing its international alliances and partnerships, particularly in South Asia. The long-standing relationship with Pakistan has been contentious, characterized by mutual distrust and mixed success in curbing terrorist threats. Observers are keenly watching to see how this bill might influence regional stability and U.S. foreign policy as it unfolds in the coming months.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the One Bill, One Subject Transparency Act, aimed at enhancing legislative accountability by mandating that each bill presented in Congress addresses only one subject. This legislative proposal, introduced on January 3, 2025, seeks to streamline the legislative process and reduce the potential for unnecessary attachments or amendments to bills.

The impetus for this bill stems from growing concerns among lawmakers and citizens about legislative practices where multiple, often unrelated, issues are bundled into single bills, leading to confusion and potentially controversial policy changes being hidden within larger legislation. By enforcing a one-subject limit, supporters believe the law will foster clearer discussions, allowing Congress members to make more informed decisions that reflect their constituents' will.

The potential impact of the One Bill, One Subject Transparency Act could be significant. If enacted, any bill not conforming to this standard would be rendered void, creating an environment where legislators must be meticulous in their drafting. Additionally, individuals aggrieved by the passage of laws that violate this standard will have the right to take legal action against the government, strengthening checks on legislative actions.

This legislative measure aligns with broader movements aimed at increasing transparency and civic engagement in politics. Advocates argue that clearer and more focused legislation will empower voters to understand policy implications better, ultimately enhancing democratic accountability. 

As the bill moves to the House Judiciary Committee, it will face scrutiny from various stakeholders, each weighing the pros and cons of shifting historic legislative practices toward enhanced clarity and focused governance.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has unveiled a new legislative measure known as the Buzz Off Act, aiming to prohibit federal law enforcement agencies from employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance of U.S. citizens. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, seeks to protect individual privacy rights and limit government surveillance capabilities.

The introduction of the Buzz Off Act comes amidst growing concerns over privacy violations and the potential misuse of drone technology. Many lawmakers, civil liberties advocates, and constituents have raised alarms about the increasing use of UAVs for surveillance purposes, fearing that such practices could lead to unwarranted invasions of privacy and erosion of personal freedoms. The bill is a direct response to these concerns, seeking to establish clear boundaries regarding federal surveillance capabilities.

Under the proposed legislation, federal agencies will be barred from using drones to intentionally gather information on or photograph U.S. citizens without express written consent. However, exceptions are provided in situations where an authorized official certifies the necessity for counter-terrorism efforts or obtains a warrant from a judge, adding a layer of accountability and oversight.

If enacted, the Buzz Off Act could significantly impact the way law enforcement conducts surveillance operations. Critics of drone surveillance argue that the technology poses a threat to civil liberties, and this bill may pave the way for broader discussions on the ethical use of technology within governmental practices. Rep. Biggs's initiative aligns with a growing movement among various stakeholders advocating for stronger privacy protections in the age of advanced surveillance technologies. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Injunctive Authority Clarification Act, aiming to amend Title 28 of the United States Code by prohibiting federal courts from issuing national injunctions against enforcement actions involving non-parties. This legislation intends to clarify and limit the authority of courts in issuing broad injunctions that can affect individuals or entities not directly involved in a legal case.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing debates about the growing trend of national injunctions, which critics argue create confusion and undermine the judicial process. Proponents believe these injunctions can lead to inconsistent rulings across different jurisdictions, potentially leading to complicity in non-compliance with federal laws and regulations. By restricting such judicial practices, Biggs aims to streamline enforcement and reduce legal uncertainties surrounding courtroom decisions.

Should the bill pass, it could significantly alter the landscape of federal litigation. With limitations on national injunctions, litigants may need to seek more localized relief, potentially reducing the number of cases being filed at the federal level. This shift may also benefit federal agencies and states by allowing them to operate under a single set of legal standards rather than facing conflicting injunctions from various courts.

The Injunctive Authority Clarification Act reflects an ongoing effort by certain lawmakers to recalibrate the balance of power in federal courts. By focusing on the role of national injunctions, the legislation seeks to promote a more cohesive legal framework and minimize disruption in the enforcement of laws. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, its implications could resonate across various sectors reliant on consistent regulatory guidance.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the End Endless Criminal Statutes Act, a legislative effort aimed at repealing several outdated and unnecessary federal criminal offenses. This bill targets regulations that Biggs argues no longer serve a valid purpose and instead burden individuals with criminal liability for minor infractions.

The act identifies various infractions that range from writing a check for less than one dollar to sledge on the Capitol grounds. By legislating for the repeal of these archaic laws, the bill seeks to alleviate the potential for unwarranted prosecution and to streamline the federal legal framework. Such offenses have been criticized for being overly punitive and contributing to unnecessary complications in the justice system.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing advocacy for criminal justice reform and a reevaluation of laws that disproportionately impact individuals without a significant public safety justification. By addressing these outdated statutes, Biggs intends to foster a legal environment where federal law prioritizes meaningful offenses, thereby enhancing fairness in the legal process.

As this legislation progresses through the House Judiciary Committee, its potential impact could resonate with a broad spectrum of citizens who have faced legal repercussions for these trivial offenses. The bill aligns with ongoing discussions about the necessity of certain criminal laws and aims to simplify the legal landscape, reflecting a shift towards a more pragmatic approach to federal statutes.

Supporters of the bill argue that repealing these redundant laws not only reduces the risk of prosecutorial overreach but also exemplifies efficiency in governmental operations. If successful, this initiative could set a precedent for further legislative reforms regarding criminal justice in the United States.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Protecting Businesses From Frivolous COVID Lawsuits Act, which aims to provide legal protections for businesses facing negligence claims related to COVID-19 transmission. This legislation proposes specific jury instructions that judges must provide in federal civil cases that involve such claims, thereby addressing concerns about potential abuse of the legal system during the pandemic.

The bill arises from growing frustrations among business owners who have faced a wave of lawsuits since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many business operators argue that they took reasonable precautions to protect customers and employees from infection, yet have found themselves entangled in litigation. By establishing clear legal standards, the bill seeks to alleviate fears of liability for simply remaining open in compliance with public health guidelines.

Under the proposed legislation, the liability standard for negligence would align with what a reasonable person would do in similar situations. Critically, the act specifies that merely opening a business during the pandemic cannot be deemed negligent by itself, supporting a rationale that businesses acted legitimately if they followed available safety protocols. 

The introduction of this bill represents a key step in an ongoing discussion about the legal ramifications of COVID-19 and aims to stabilize the operational landscape for businesses still recovering from pandemic-induced disruptions. With many enterprises on the brink of financial collapse, this legislation could provide much-needed reassurance and security, allowing them to focus on recovery rather than litigation. The bill has been forwarded to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Protect the Gig Economy Act, aiming to shield gig economy workers and small businesses from the costly repercussions of class action lawsuits. This legislation seeks to amend Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to better protect service contractors from these legal challenges.

The gig economy has been a significant contributor to the modern workforce, providing flexible job opportunities for millions. However, many gig workers operate as independent contractors, making them vulnerable to potential legal misclassification and subsequent class action claims. The introduction of this bill comes at a time when the gig labor market has faced increasing scrutiny and legislative attention due to its evolving nature.

If passed, the bill would establish that claims alleging misclassification of independent contractors cannot form the basis for class action lawsuits, potentially reducing legal costs for small businesses that rely heavily on contractor services. This measure is intended to encourage growth and innovation within the gig sector, alleviating concerns for businesses worried about burdensome litigation. 

Many small businesses argue that protecting contractors from such lawsuits is vital not only for their survival but also for the overall health of the economy. By fostering an environment less fearful of legal entanglements, proponents believe the bill could lead to increased job creation and a stronger gig economy.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on the Judiciary for review, it will undergo scrutiny and debate, reflecting broader discussions about worker rights and the regulatory landscape of gig work in the 21st century. This legislation could mark a pivotal step in defining the future of work in the United States.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Judicial Administration and Improvement Act, which aims to reorganize the Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals by dividing it into two separate judicial circuits. This bill, presented on January 3, 2025, seeks to address the growing concerns over case backlogs and the increased complexity of judicial matters within the current structure.

The Ninth Circuit, known for its diverse range of jurisdictions encompassing states like California and Alaska, has faced criticism for lengthy court proceedings and administrative inefficiencies. In response, the proposed legislation would create a Twelfth Circuit, consisting of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, with a dedicated set of circuit judges. This division is anticipated to improve the efficiency and accessibility of legal proceedings for millions of residents in both circuits.

The bill reflects a broader trend in Congress to modernize the judicial system amidst escalating demands on the court's resources. The Ninth Circuit has historically been the largest, leading to challenges in timely case management. By establishing a separate court for the Twelfth Circuit, proponents argue that judges will be better equipped to manage caseloads relevant to their geographic areas, ultimately expediting judicial outcomes.

In addition to dividing the circuit, the legislation also proposes adjustments to the number of judges allocated to each circuit and sets forth plans for the appointment of judges to fill any resulting vacancies. As it moves forward, this bill will undergo committee review and debate before potentially impacting the judicial landscape significantly. Continued discussions surrounding judicial reform showcase the importance of establishing a legal system that meets the needs of the public effectively.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the American Sovereignty and Species Protection Act, aimed at amending the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This bill seeks to prohibit the listing of nonnative species as endangered or threatened, alongside restrictions on specific financial assistance linked to foreign land acquisitions.

The proposal's introduction arises from concerns over federal regulations perceived to prioritize nonnative species over indigenous ecosystems. Supporters argue that such measures will protect domestic wildlife and resources, ensuring focus remains on species native to the U.S. Critics, however, warn it could undermine conservation efforts for newly introduced species that may play crucial roles in their respective ecosystems.

Should the bill pass, it represents a significant shift in conservation policy. By restricting the definition of endangered species, the legislation could spark substantial debate over the government's role in environmental stewardship. Advocates suggest it would allow for better resource allocation, focusing on species that naturally belong to American habitats while minimizing governmental interference in local environmental management.

The implications of this bill stretch beyond conservation groups; local economies that rely on eco-tourism and biodiversity could also experience shifts. For instance, areas that attract nature enthusiasts through diverse wildlife could see changes in funding and protection measures.

With the bill currently referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, further discussions and potential modifications are expected. Lawmakers and stakeholders will need to navigate the delicate balance between protecting American wildlife and addressing the challenges posed by global ecological shifts. As the debate unfolds, the legislation could reshape the future of conservation in the U.S. and beyond.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Congressional Border Security Assessment Act aimed at granting Congressional members lawful access to certain Indian land along the U.S.-Mexico border. This legislation permits lawmakers to assess national security and public safety in areas deemed critical for border security, enhancing oversight of the international boundary.

The need for this bill arises amid ongoing debates regarding immigration and border security, particularly concerning the effectiveness of current measures. By allowing Congress members and their staff to survey these regions, the bill seeks to provide them with firsthand knowledge to inform legislative decisions. Access will specifically be granted to Indian reservations that stretch for 50 or more contiguous miles along the border, ensuring that lawmakers can effectively evaluate conditions directly.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it could reshape how border security policies are formulated by offering insights that reflect the realities on the ground. Tribal leaders and communities, however, have expressed concerns over how this access might affect their sovereignty and the preservation of their lands. This measure adds another layer to the ongoing discourse on balancing security with the rights of Indigenous peoples.

This introduction marks a critical step in the legislative process, as it has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration. If passed, it could facilitate a new approach to border security, aiming to enhance safety while respecting tribal land rights. Lawmakers will need to navigate these complex relationships as they discuss the bill in the coming days.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Protecting Arizona from Federal Land Grabs Act, aimed at restricting the federal government's ability to establish or expand national monuments in Arizona without Congressional approval. This legislation reflects ongoing concerns among Arizona residents and state leaders regarding federal overreach in land management.

The proposal comes in response to past incidents where significant areas of state land were designated as national monuments without local consultation or consent. Proponents of the bill argue that such actions undermine state sovereignty and disregard the interests of communities directly affected by these decisions. By requiring Congressional authorization for any new designations in Arizona, the bill seeks to ensure that local voices are prioritized in land-use decisions.

If enacted, this legislation could significantly impact how national monuments are established in Arizona, a state known for its vast natural landscapes and historical sites. Many believe that this approach could foster better collaboration between federal and state authorities, ensuring that land management aligns with the interests of local stakeholders. Conversely, critics fear that overly stringent regulations could hinder conservation efforts and limit protections for Arizona's unique ecosystems.

Background on federal land management indicates a longstanding tension between local governance and federal authority, particularly in states rich in natural resources. Arizona's diverse geography, ranging from deserts to mountainous terrains, makes it a focal point in discussions about land usage. As the political landscape evolves, the outcomes of such legislation will likely shape future debates on environmental conservation and state versus federal rights.

The Protecting Arizona from Federal Land Grabs Act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration, as lawmakers await responses from stakeholders.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Increasing Public Access to Recreation Act to enhance public access to recreational areas on federal lands. This new legislation aims to increase the percentage of funds allocated for recreational access from 3% to an ambitious 10%, thus raising the cap from $15 million to $50 million annually.

This bill addresses the longstanding concern regarding limited accessibility to public recreational areas, which can hinder outdoor activities and tourism. The initiative comes in response to growing demands from constituents who emphasize the importance of outdoor spaces for community engagement, mental health, and overall quality of life. Several advocates have pointed out the significant benefits that accessible parks and recreational areas provide, including promoting physical health and fostering community interaction.

By expanding funding, the Increasing Public Access to Recreation Act is expected to facilitate improvements and maintenance of existing facilities, as well as the development of new recreational sites. This enhancement is particularly crucial as cities and towns across the country struggle with the balance between urban development and the preservation of green spaces, a growing challenge as populations expand.

The bill, currently referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, reflects a broader legislative trend prioritizing outdoor and recreational initiatives in federal policy. If passed, it could lead to significant changes in how recreational spaces are funded and maintained, allowing more citizens to engage with and enjoy their natural surroundings. As debates continue in Congress, the act’s potential to reshape the landscape of public recreation funding is drawing attention from various stakeholders across the spectrum.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Less Imprecision in Species Treatment Act of 2025, or the LIST Act, aimed at reforming the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The bill seeks to enhance the precision of species classification processes by implementing clearer guidelines for listing, delisting, and downlisting endangered species.

The LIST Act was proposed in response to ongoing concerns regarding the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the current species listing procedures, which many believe hinder conservation efforts. By calling for a more stringent application of scientific data in the evaluation process, the bill aims to prevent misclassification of species, thereby allowing for more effective management strategies tailored to actual ecological needs.

The Act stipulates that the Secretary of the Interior must act to delist species that have met recovery goals or show significant recovery based on new scientific information. This provision is expected to streamline the process, reducing bureaucratic delays that can limit conservation initiatives. Additionally, the bill introduces consequences for submissions deemed fraudulent or misrepresentative, promoting accountability in species evaluation.

With the LIST Act, proponents hope to bolster the integrity of the Endangered Species Act, ensuring that restoration efforts are based on accurate assessments of species health. The legislation includes a provision for regular reviews of species status, aiming to ensure that only those species truly in need of protection remain listed.

As environmental concerns continue to escalate, the LIST Act of 2025 represents a significant step towards achieving a more scientifically grounded approach to biodiversity conservation. The bill is now with the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Return to Work Act, aimed at reinstating telework policies that were in place across executive agencies as of December 31, 2019. This legislation arises from ongoing discussions about remote work's impact on productivity, accountability, and employee satisfaction, especially following the widespread adoption of telework during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bill mandates that heads of executive agencies must restore prior telework policies no later than 60 days after its enactment. Proponents argue that these policies provide employees with the flexibility they require while ensuring operational efficiency. By restoring these remote work arrangements, agencies can potentially retain talent and adapt to modern workforce expectations, including a preference for work-life balance.

This proposal is particularly relevant as organizations continue grappling with how to best integrate remote work into their operational models long-term. Many employees have expressed a desire to maintain some level of flexibility and remote options in their work arrangements. By reinstating these policies, the Return to Work Act seeks to ensure agencies are equipped to provide such accommodations.

The legislation comes at a time when a number of federal workers have raised concerns regarding the potential retraction of remote work policies, fearing that losing flexibility may lead to decreased morale and increased turnover. Biggs' initiative could help counter that trend by embedding flexible work arrangements into the federal landscape, enhancing employee retention and attracting a diverse workforce.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, focusing on its implications for government operations and employee satisfaction. If passed, it could redefine the future of work within federal agencies.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Space Research Innovation Act, aimed at establishing a pioneering research center for deep-space and interplanetary exploration under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This initiative seeks to bolster the United States' leadership in space research and advance vital technology capabilities for upcoming missions.

The bill addresses a growing need for specialized research as the space exploration landscape evolves. With increasing interest in cis-lunar activities and missions targeting Mars, the legislation underlines the necessity for a university-affiliated research center that can facilitate academic and private sector collaboration. By allowing entities like higher education institutions and nonprofit research organizations to partner with NASA, the proposed center aims to enhance the nation's scientific acumen in deep-space endeavors.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act aimed at formally recognizing caregivers of veterans, enhancing communication between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the veteran community, and ensuring benefits continuity for those deemed ineligible for caregiver programs.

The legislation responds to increasing concerns regarding the welfare of veteran caregivers, who play a crucial role in supporting veterans throughout their recovery and daily lives. Many caregivers have expressed frustration over the lack of formal acknowledgment in their veterans' health records, which has led to challenges in accessing essential resources and support services. By mandating the VA to include caregivers in health records, the Act hopes to strengthen their recognition and service eligibility.

Moreover, the bill requires the VA to implement a standardized system for notifying veterans and their caregivers about clinical determinations regarding caregiver program eligibility. Enhanced communication would provide more clarity, helping caregivers understand the status of assistance programs and required actions, thus reducing uncertainty and stress.

The legislation further proposes a temporary extension of benefits for veterans following a clinical determination of ineligibility for the comprehensive assistance program. This ensures that veterans continue to receive necessary support for a minimum of 90 days, allowing time for transitional arrangements. This provision addresses urgent concerns that sudden loss of benefits could adversely affect veterans and their caregivers.

As discussions around veteran care continue in Congress, the TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act represents a significant step toward improving the support structure for both veterans and those who care for them, ensuring their crucial roles are recognized and adequately supported. Representative Biggs emphasized that this legislation is an essential acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by caregivers in the name of veteran care.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Small Business Prosperity Act, aiming to enhance support for America's small businesses by expanding tax deductions on qualified business income. This significant legislative proposal is intended to stimulate growth and alleviate financial burdens on small enterprises across the nation.

The act seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to make substantial changes to Section 199A, which provides tax deductions for business income. Currently set at 20%, the bill proposes to increase this deduction to 43%, escalating to 47% in future tax years. Additionally, the proposal eliminates certain restrictions related to the deduction, including those based on W-2 wages, thereby broadening access for more businesses and simplifying tax compliance for small business owners.

Biggs introduced this bill in response to concerns that many small businesses were adversely affected by rising costs and economic instability, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With many entrepreneurs struggling to maintain profitability, this legislation aims to provide the necessary breathing room for growth. Expanding and simplifying tax deductions stands to empower small businesses, encouraging reinvestment in infrastructure and workforce, which can lead to job creation and economic resilience.

Furthermore, the Small Business Prosperity Act repeals the estate tax for decedents dying after December 31, 2024, preserving the financial legacy for families and enhancing wealth transfer for business owners. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means and is expected to spark discussions on how best to support the backbone of the U.S. economy—small businesses.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced a new bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals to take an above-the-line deduction for health insurance premiums. This initiative, officially known as H.R. 111, seeks to provide taxpayers with a more straightforward way to reduce their taxable income by including health insurance costs.

The introduction of this bill responds to ongoing concerns about the rising costs of health insurance, which many Americans struggle to afford. By enabling an above-the-line deduction, individuals would be able to deduct their health insurance premiums directly from their gross income, regardless of whether they itemize other deductions. This could significantly alleviate financial burdens, particularly for self-employed individuals and those with limited means.

The potential impact of this legislation is noteworthy. Advocates argue that this change could incentivize more people to acquire health insurance coverage, potentially leading to improved public health outcomes. By making health insurance more financially accessible, this bill aims to reduce the number of uninsured Americans, thereby supporting broader healthcare initiatives and stability in the insurance market.

Currently, health insurance premiums are generally considered itemized deductions. This can complicate the tax filing process and may discourage some taxpayers from utilizing the full benefits available to them. By simplifying the deduction process with an above-the-line provision, Rep. Biggs hopes to make tax preparation easier and provide direct financial relief to taxpayers.

Following its introduction, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, marking the first step in the legislative process. As discussions progress, stakeholders in the healthcare and taxation sectors will be closely monitoring the bill's developments.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Farewell to Unnecessary Energy Lifelines Reform Act, known as the FUEL Reform Act, aimed at repealing the Department of Agriculture's bioenergy subsidy programs. The bill, introduced on January 3, 2025, targets subsidies that Biggs and supporters argue are unnecessary and costly to taxpayers.

The FUEL Reform Act comes in response to growing concerns about fiscal responsibility and environmental impacts tied to government-funded energy initiatives. Proponents believe that eliminating these subsidies will allow for a more market-driven approach to energy production, potentially spurring innovation in renewable energy without the burden of tax-funded support. Advocates for the repeal argue that such measures result in market distortions and hinder true competition in the energy sector.

This legislation reflects a broader shift towards a limited government approach, emphasizing the need for efficiency in federal programs. By repealing the bioenergy subsidies, the bill seeks to redirect funds toward more effective initiatives that could better serve the agricultural and energy sectors without unnecessary financial strain.

Biggs has positioned the FUEL Reform Act as critical for promoting a sustainable energy future while reducing the deadweight of government intervention. The act targets previously established subsidy programs in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which have come under scrutiny for their long-term viability and effectiveness.

This bill has been referred to the agriculture, oversight, and science committees for review and potential amendments. If passed, it could significantly alter the landscape of agricultural and energy policy, focusing on a fiscally conservative strategy while addressing future energy strategies without reliance on government funding.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, introduced the Budget Process Enhancement Act on January 3, 2025, aiming to reform the budgetary process within Congress. This legislation seeks to eliminate discretionary inflation from the budget baseline and proposes that Congress members’ salaries be placed in escrow should they fail to agree on a concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2026.

This bill arises in response to recurring budgetary impasses and increasing fiscal irresponsibility observed in recent congressional sessions. By enforcing greater accountability through the withholding of salaries, the legislation aims to incentivize timely budget agreement among Congress members. The act emphasizes the importance of fiscal discipline as budget negotiations often extend beyond set deadlines, creating uncertainties that affect various government operations and financial markets.

Should the Budget Process Enhancement Act pass, its potential impact is twofold: first, it will directly pressure lawmakers to fulfill their budgeting responsibilities; second, it introduces a more rigid framework for adjusting budgetary baselines, requiring exclusion of certain emergency funds from inflation adjustments. This is a significant shift given that inflation adjustments often inflate budget figures without necessarily increasing real spending capacity.

The act also mandates oversight by the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management to ensure compliance with the timely submission of the President's budget. Consequently, if the Office of Management and Budget does not meet deadlines, the act stipulates that its officials will not receive pay during periods of noncompliance. The introduction of this bill underscores a bid for greater fiscal responsibility in governance amid ongoing discussions about national debt and budget deficits in Congress.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, has introduced the Responsible Path to Full Obamacare Repeal Act aimed at repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This legislation proposes to restore laws that were modified or annulled by the ACA, setting an effective date for the repeal on October 1, 2025.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing debates about health care reform in the United States. Proponents argue that the ACA has contributed to rising health care costs and limited choices for consumers. By repealing this legislation, they hope to pave the way for a more market-driven approach to health care, thereby increasing competition and potentially lowering prices. Critics, however, warn that such a repeal could strip millions of their health coverage, leaving those with pre-existing conditions vulnerable and possibly increasing the number of uninsured Americans.

Biggs' act is significant as it comes at a time when health care remains a pivotal issue for voters. The proposal will be referred to multiple committees, including Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, where it will be evaluated for its potential impacts and implications. The bill's complexity and the array of stakeholders involved highlight the contentious nature of health care legislation.

As the 119th Congress progresses, this move signals a continuing effort by Republican leaders to dismantle the legacy of the ACA. The future of this bill will depend on the political climate and the priorities of both parties as they navigate health care reform, signaling an important chapter in the American healthcare landscape.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the No Free Rent for Freeloaders Act of 2025, a bill aimed at establishing penalties for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for failures to enforce compliance with community service and self-sufficiency requirements in public housing. The bill seeks to ensure that residents in public housing actively fulfill these obligations in order to receive federal housing assistance.

The introduction of this legislation stems from growing concerns regarding the efficiency of public housing programs and the perceived exploitation of federal resources. By implementing stricter monitoring and penalties, Biggs aims to address the issue of noncompliance, which has led to an increase in costs borne by taxpayers. Current laws require tenants to engage in community service or equivalent self-sufficiency activities, yet compliance has lagged in many areas, prompting the need for legislative reform.

Key provisions of the bill include an annual review by the HUD Inspector General to assess compliance levels and a subsequent determination of federal subsidies allocated to noncompliant households. Furthermore, penalties in the form of financial rescissions from HUD’s management and administration accounts are prescribed, which would directly impact the department's operational funding in cases of documented noncompliance.

Advocates of the bill argue that it will enhance accountability within public housing programs and promote a culture of responsibility among residents who benefit from federal assistance. By ensuring that federal funds are allocated effectively, the No Free Rent for Freeloaders Act is positioned as a significant reform that could have lasting impacts on the administration of public housing and its role in supporting vulnerable populations. The bill is currently under consideration by the House Committees on Financial Services and Appropriations.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Stopping Border Surges Act, a legislative measure aimed at reforming U.S. immigration laws to address what he describes as loopholes encouraging illegal entry into the country. The bill seeks to enhance border security and streamline processes related to unaccompanied alien children and asylum applications.

The backdrop for the introduction of this bill stems from ongoing concerns regarding increasing numbers of unauthorized crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. With significant attention on immigration policy, the legislation attempts to stabilize and regulate the process by which individuals seek asylum or entry into the U.S. Key provisions include expedited repatriation for unaccompanied minors, strict penalties for asylum fraud, and a streamlined process for evaluating credible fear claims.

If enacted, the Stopping Border Surges Act could substantially affect the adjudication of asylum applications, requiring faster processing and potentially limiting the number of claims processed. By redefining eligibility standards and clarifying procedures surrounding family detention, the bill aims to disincentivize unlawful entry while managing the influx of immigrants seeking refuge. 

Moreover, the legislation reflects a growing urgency among lawmakers to address immigration concerns, as reports indicate a surge in border encounters over recent months. Lawmakers are focusing on balancing national security with humanitarian responsibilities towards migrants. The Stopping Border Surges Act has been referred to the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees, where its provisions will be scrutinized further. As discussions unfold in Congress, the bill represents a pivotal moment in shaping U.S. immigration policy amid ongoing debates over border security and humanitarian treatment of migrants.

WASHINGTON, March 10 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Fourth Amendment Restoration Act, a significant legislative proposal aimed at repealing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978. This bill seeks to reinforce privacy rights for U.S. citizens by limiting government surveillance capabilities, which proponents argue violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.

The introduction of this legislation follows ongoing concerns over government overreach and privacy issues linked to FISA, which allows intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance on foreign entities. Critics argue that these provisions often inadvertently affect U.S. citizens, leading to potential violations of civil liberties. Rep. Biggs emphasized the bill's intent to ensure that U.S. citizens benefit from the privacy protections stipulated in the Fourth Amendment.

By repealing FISA, the bill aims to establish stricter criteria for surveillance, mandating that law enforcement obtain a warrant from a federal court to monitor communications of U.S. citizens. The proposed legislation seeks to prevent the unregulated collection of data without probable cause, thereby protecting citizens' rights against governmental intrusion. It also introduces consequences for those found to be engaging in unauthorized surveillance activities.

The impact of this bill could be profound, as it addresses growing public skepticism regarding federal surveillance practices, particularly in the wake of high-profile revelations about government monitoring programs. Advocates for the bill consider it a vital step toward restoring trust in governmental institutions and re-establishing civil liberties protections undermined by previous legislation. 

The Fourth Amendment Restoration Act has been referred to the Judiciary Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for further consideration. As the debate unfolds, the proposal may reignite discussions concerning the balance between national security and individual privacy rights.
