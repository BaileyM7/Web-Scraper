WASHINGTON, March 12 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2025, aimed at prohibiting federal funding for abortions and ensuring full transparency in health insurance coverage related to abortion services. This legislation addresses ongoing concerns regarding taxpayers indirectly financing abortion procedures and treatments, responding to calls from constituents advocating for fiscal responsibility and moral integrity.

The bill builds on longstanding efforts by pro-life advocates to restrict access to federally funded abortions. It prohibits any federal funds from being utilized for abortion services, including within federal facilities and health plans receiving federal subsidies. Additionally, the proposed legislation stipulates that health insurance providers must disclose if their plans cover abortion, thereby enhancing consumer awareness regarding any potential costs associated with such coverage. 

The introduction of this bill comes amid heightened public debate over abortion funding following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Proponents argue that taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize a practice many consider morally objectionable, while critics assert it undermines access to essential reproductive health services. The act aims to align federal law with various states that have enacted similar restrictions on abortion funding.

The legislation is expected to be reviewed by the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Ways and Means. If enacted, it would alter the landscape of abortion funding significantly, establishing stricter boundaries on federal financial involvement in abortion services and enhancing the reporting obligations of health insurers. Stakeholders on both sides of the abortion debate are prepared for significant discussions as the bill moves forward.
