WASHINGTON, March 4 -- Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, has introduced the Red Snapper Act of 2025, aimed at protecting the South Atlantic fishery sector while ensuring sustainable management of red snapper populations. This legislation proposes that the Secretary of Commerce refrain from implementing any interim or final rules for area closures in the South Atlantic until the completion of the South Atlantic Great Red Snapper Count study and its data is integrated into relevant stock assessments.

The bill responds to the growing concerns among Florida's fishermen and the broader fishing industry, which are critical to the state’s economy. With recreational fishing generating an estimated $14 billion in economic output and supporting tens of thousands of jobs in Florida alone, the law aims to prevent any new rules that could further restrict access to fishing areas without thorough scientific backing. The current abundance of red snapper in the South Atlantic presents both opportunities and challenges, as increasing out-of-season encounters may lead to unintended fish mortality.

Without clear scientific data, the proposed closures could economically harm local communities that rely heavily on fishing activities. The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council’s Advisory Panel indicated that red snapper stocks are on the rebound, suggesting the need for data-driven approaches rather than abrupt regulatory changes. 

As fishing authorities have invested significant resources into surveys to accurately estimate red snapper populations, incorporating these findings into future assessments is deemed crucial for informed decision-making. The Red Snapper Act of 2025 represents a step toward balancing conservation efforts with the economic realities faced by local fishing communities.

The bill (S. 111) was introduced on 01/16/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 4 -- Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-TN, has introduced the “Make the Migrant Protection Protocols Mandatory Act of 2025,” aimed at enforcing stricter immigration measures by making the implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) a requirement rather than an option. This legislative move seeks to revise section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, mandating that asylum seekers be returned to Mexico while their claims are processed.

The bill comes at a time of increasing concern over border security and immigration reform. By reinforcing the MPP, which was initially enacted under the Trump administration, Blackburn argues that the legislation will deter unauthorized entries into the U.S. and streamline processing procedures. The MPP was put in place to reduce the number of migrants entering the U.S. without following legal protocols, aiming instead to have them remain in Mexico as their cases are reviewed.

If passed, this bill could significantly impact the ongoing discussions about immigration policy, particularly as the Biden administration has expressed intentions to end such protocols, citing humanitarian concerns. The potential resurgence of MPP may affect thousands of asylum seekers, raising questions about their safety and legal rights while staying in Mexico.

Several Republican senators, including Steve Daines and Mike Crapo, have co-sponsored the bill, indicating a bipartisan effort within the party to address what they view as a critical issue in national security. As the bill moves to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further discussion and review, the political landscape surrounding immigration reform in the U.S. is expected to evolve, with implications for both migrants and border enforcement strategies.

The bill (S. 112) introduced on 01/16/2025 has 9 co-sponsors: Sen. Daines, Steve [R-MT] 01/16/2025; Sen. Risch, James E. [R-ID] 01/16/2025; Sen. Sheehy, Tim [R-MT] 01/16/2025; Sen. Crapo, Mike [R-ID] 01/16/2025; Sen. Rounds, Mike [R-SD] 01/16/2025; Sen. Moran, Jerry [R-KS] 01/16/2025; Sen. Tillis, Thomas [R-NC] 01/16/2025; Sen. Moreno, Bernie [R-OH] 01/21/2025; Sen. Hyde-Smith, Cindy [R-MS] 01/22/2025.

WASHINGTON, March 4 -- Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-MS, has introduced a new legislative proposal aimed at revitalizing banking access in underserved communities. The Promoting New Bank Formation Act seeks to establish a three-year phase-in period for newly established banks to comply with federal capital standards. By easing these requirements, the bill aims to encourage the formation of de novo financial institutions, particularly in rural areas that have suffered from banking consolidation.

This initiative comes as recent trends show a concerning decrease in local banking services, particularly in rural counties where financial institutions have shut down at alarming rates. A 2019 Federal Reserve report highlighted that many rural areas are deeply affected by the loss of bank branches, leading to increased poverty and economic challenges in these regions. The proposed legislation addresses these issues by allowing new banks to operate under relaxed capital constraints initially, thereby fostering an environment conducive to their growth.

The bill's provisions include modifications that allow new institutions to deviate from their approved business plans during the three-year timeline, making it easier for them to adapt to changing market conditions without severe penalties. This flexibility is intended to enhance their chances of surviving and thriving in a competitive financial landscape.

With the challenge of securing necessary capital being a major barrier to the formation of new banks, this legislation is poised to impact not only the financial sector but also the communities reliant on accessible banking options. By enabling more financial institutions to form and operate, the Promoting New Bank Formation Act could play a vital role in reinvigorating local economies and providing essential services to those who need it most.

The bill (S. 113) introduced on 01/16/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Sen. Sheehy, Tim [R-MT] [01/27/2025].
