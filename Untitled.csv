WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-NJ, has introduced the Homes for Young Adults Act of 2025, aiming to address the urgent housing crisis facing young adults and youth across the nation. This legislation seeks to amend the United States Housing Act of 1937, to extend housing assistance specifically tailored for those aged 18 to 30 who experience unstable living conditions.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to alarming statistics revealing that approximately 4.2 million youth and young adults in the U.S. encounter homelessness each year. Disproportionately affecting communities of color and LGBTQ+ youth, the lack of accessible housing resources has forced many into congregate shelters, perpetuating cycles of poverty and instability. By removing systemic barriers that limit access to current housing assistance programs, the act aims to improve living conditions and overall outcomes for young individuals in need.

The Homes for Young Adults Act proposes the creation of an entitlement program that guarantees housing choice vouchers for eligible youth and young adults. This initiative highlights a critical need, as many young individuals can wait up to 140 days to secure stable housing through existing programs. Ensuring timely access to housing assistance will not only reduce homelessness but also contribute to enhanced educational and economic outcomes for this vulnerable demographic.

Additionally, the bill emphasizes comprehensive support services alongside housing assistance, enabling participants to navigate housing applications, access job training, and receive legal guidance. This holistic approach aims to empower young adults to achieve self-sufficiency while fostering healthier communities.

With bipartisan support anticipated, the Homes for Young Adults Act represents a significant step toward fostering equity in housing opportunities and supporting a critical population in overcoming the challenges of homelessness.

The bill (H.R. 2479) introduced on 03/27/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Tlaib, Rashida [D-MI-12]...03/27/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-CA, has introduced the No Hungry Kids in Schools Act, aimed at improving access to nutritious meals for students across California. The bill seeks to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to allow for statewide community eligibility for certain special assistance payments, ensuring that all eligible students receive free meals.

The necessity for this legislation emerges from escalating concerns over childhood hunger, exacerbated by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational institutions continue to face challenges in providing adequate nutrition to students, with significant disparities in access to food across different regions. By implementing statewide eligibility, the proposed act intends to simplify administrative processes and reduce the stigma often associated with free meal programs.

The No Hungry Kids in Schools Act could significantly impact thousands of students by removing barriers to meal access, directly supporting their health and educational outcomes. Adopting a statewide approach means that all local educational agencies (LEAs) in California could collectively ensure that no student goes hungry. This initiative is also designed to encourage state funding to complement federal resources, thus further enhancing meal programs and their sustainability.

In addition, the legislation aligns with broader national goals to combat food insecurity among children, reflecting mounting bipartisan awareness of the critical importance of nutrition in education. The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders, including educators and health advocates who emphasize the link between proper nutrition and academic achievement.

Currently, the act is under consideration in the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where it is expected to receive close scrutiny as legislators deliberate on its potential benefits for families across the state.

The bill (H.R. 2402) introduced on 03/27/2025 has 14 co-sponsors: Rep. Carson, André [D-IN-7]...03/27/2025; Rep. Chu, Judy [D-CA-28]...03/27/2025; Rep. DeSaulnier, Mark [D-CA-10]...03/27/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2403",40434,"Rep. Allen Introduces TELL Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA, has introduced the TELL Act, designed to enhance transparency regarding data security for Americans using online platforms. This legislation aims to require any entity that maintains a website or distributes a mobile application, storing user information in China, to disclose where the data is stored and whether the Chinese Communist Party or state-owned entities have access to it.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing concerns about the security of personal data in an era of increasing cyber threats and scrutiny about foreign influence. With the rise of data collection practices, especially from companies operating in countries with less stringent privacy regulations, Allen's proposal seeks to empower users to make informed decisions about their data. It aims to hold companies accountable for providing clear communication about data practices that might affect user privacy.

The potential impact of the TELL Act could be significant. By establishing mandatory disclosure protocols, it intends to create a higher standard for privacy practices and could influence how companies design their data collection strategies moving forward. Furthermore, if passed, the act would enable the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these requirements, classifying violations as unfair or deceptive practices under current law.

As it currently stands, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. The push for transparency surrounding data storage practices highlights a broader national dialogue regarding data privacy rights, especially as user concerns continue to escalate over the security of their personal information.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-IA, has introduced a new bill aimed at continuing the provisions of Executive Order 14224, which designates English as the official language of the United States. The proposed legislation seeks to ensure that this directive remains in effect indefinitely, reflecting an ongoing commitment to the use of English in government and public affairs.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing discussions about national identity and language use within governmental contexts. Proponents believe that designating an official language can strengthen unity and facilitate communication among diverse populations. The bill's supporters argue that maintaining English as the official language is essential for effective governance and clarity in legal and administrative matters.

This legislation could significantly impact various sectors, including education, public service, and immigration. If enacted, it would mandate that all official government documents, public communications, and legislative proceedings be conducted in English. This move may streamline processes but could also generate debates regarding accessibility for non-English speakers.

Miller-Meeks, alongside fellow co-sponsor Rep. Harshbarger, emphasized the importance of understanding national values in the context of language use. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Education and Workforce, as well as Oversight and Government Reform, for further examination and consideration.

As the bill progresses, it is likely to attract attention from various advocacy groups, both for and against the measure. Those in opposition may raise concerns about inclusivity and the implications for immigrants and diverse communities. With these discussions anticipated, the bill offers a focal point in the ongoing debate over the role of language in American society, governance, and identity.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2405",40434,"Rep. Barr Introduces The White Oak Resilience Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Barr, R-KY, has introduced The White Oak Resilience Act, aimed at restoring and enhancing the health of white oak forests across the United States. This legislation seeks to establish a coordinated approach among federal, state, and local organizations to promote the regeneration of white oak, an essential species for wildlife habitats and forest ecosystems.

The bill was introduced in response to the declining health of white oak populations, which has been attributed to factors such as climate change, pests, and habitat loss. By fostering a dedicated coalition focused on white oak restoration, the act emphasizes collaborative efforts involving various stakeholders, including government agencies and private organizations. This coalition will not only facilitate restoration initiatives but also address related policy challenges that hinder white oak regeneration.

Potential impacts of the bill extend beyond ecological benefits; revitalizing white oak forests could enhance recreational opportunities, improve biodiversity, and contribute to local economies reliant on forest resources. The act includes provisions for pilot projects in national forests and directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to assess and enhance the restoration efforts further.

The initiative also proposes establishing a White Oak and Upland Oak Habitat Regeneration Program, which will provide grants and technical assistance for restoration activities. Additionally, it aims to address the shortage of tree seedlings in nurseries, ensuring adequate resources for restoration projects.

With bipartisan support, The White Oak Resilience Act is seen as a critical step toward preserving these vital ecosystems and enhancing resilience against environmental threats, ensuring their existence for future generations.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2406",40434,"Rep. Bonamici Introduces National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Improvements Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-OR, has introduced the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Improvements Act to strengthen measures against sexual harassment and assault within the agency. The bill aims to amend the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 to enhance reporting procedures, improve victim anonymity, and increase accountability for incidents involving NOAA personnel.

The legislation was prompted by rising concerns over reports of sexual misconduct within NOAA, highlighting a need for significant reform. By establishing clearer policies and guidelines, the bill intends to not only protect employees but also foster a culture of safety and respect across the agency. It mandates more comprehensive annual reports on harassment cases, offering transparency on disciplinary actions taken against offenders.

This seasonal approach to policy reform aligns with growing awareness about workplace safety and accountability in federal agencies. Given the importance of NOAA’s mission in environmental monitoring and marine conservation, ensuring a supportive workplace for all employees is critical for the agency's operational effectiveness and reputation.

Incorporating provisions for restricted reporting will allow victims to disclose incidents without automatically triggering an investigation, aiming to empower survivors and encourage reporting. The bill also seeks to enhance oversight of investigations into harassment claims, thereby promoting a more responsive approach to such serious issues.

The introduction of this legislation demonstrates a commitment to improving workplace conditions within NOAA and reflects broader national conversations about workplace safety and gender equity. As this bill moves through the legislative process, it could have a lasting impact on safeguarding the rights and well-being of NOAA employees.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2407",40434,"Rep. Brecheen Introduces SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-OK, has introduced the SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act of 2025, which aims to enhance the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by incorporating measures designed to promote self-sufficiency among beneficiaries. This legislation, introduced on March 27, 2025, focuses on improving employment opportunities and reducing dependency on federal food assistance.

The bill comes in response to growing concerns about the effectiveness of current welfare programs, which some critics argue perpetuate poverty rather than alleviate it. By modifying eligibility requirements and increasing work mandates, Brecheen's proposal intends to encourage SNAP recipients to seek gainful employment. Key components include enhanced reporting on employment and training program outcomes and the introduction of state-matching funds to incentivize local investment in SNAP initiatives.

In addition to work requirements, this reform package aims to improve the measurement of poverty in the U.S. It seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of individuals receiving federal benefits by requesting detailed data from administering agencies. The anticipated outcome is a clearer picture of the correlation between SNAP participation and employment success, allowing policymakers to make informed decisions regarding benefits distribution.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, shifting the focus of SNAP from mere assistance to a pathway for upward mobility. By encouraging beneficiaries to gain employment, the act aims to reduce the overall financial burden on taxpayers while promoting economic independence among low-income households.

The bill has already been referred to the House Committees on Agriculture and Oversight and Government Reform for further deliberation, with hopes that it will bring substantive change to the current welfare framework. As discussions proceed, stakeholders will be closely monitoring the implications of Brecheen's proposed reforms.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2410",40434,"Rep. Carey Introduces Revitalizing Downtowns and Main Streets Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Carey, R-OH, has introduced the Revitalizing Downtowns and Main Streets Act, aiming to foster the conversion of non-residential buildings into affordable housing. This legislative initiative seeks to address the growing housing crisis by providing a tax credit incentive, thereby stimulating local economies and revitalizing urban areas.

The bill is a response to the pressing need for affordable housing options across the United States, where skyrocketing rents have disproportionately affected low- and middle-income families. By incentivizing the transformation of vacant or underused commercial properties into much-needed residential spaces, the measure aims to alleviate housing shortages and breathe new life into struggling downtown areas.

The proposed legislation outlines a 20% tax credit on qualified conversion expenditures for buildings that meet specific criteria, including being at least 20 years old and previously classified as non-residential. This credit is designed to encourage property owners and developers to engage in renovations, ultimately increasing the availability of affordable housing in urban centers.

As cities grapple with economic downturns and population shifts, the Revitalizing Downtowns and Main Streets Act also emphasizes the importance of developing housing near transportation and commercial hubs. By concentrating availability in these areas, the bill aims to reduce commuting times and improve residents' access to vital services and employment opportunities.

The bill has gained early support, with a growing list of co-sponsors reflecting bipartisan interest in addressing the housing crisis. If passed, it could significantly transform urban landscapes and provide a blueprint for enhancing community resilience against economic challenges. As such, Rep. Carey’s initiative not only targets housing but also aims to stimulate economic growth and support local businesses affected by changing market dynamics.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. André Carson, D-IN, has introduced the UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act aimed at reinstating vital financial support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This legislation seeks to address the urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees, particularly amidst escalating humanitarian crises in regions such as Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria.

The bill was introduced in response to recent cuts in funding to UNRWA, which has historically provided essential services, including education, healthcare, and emergency relief. Carson emphasized that diminishing support could exacerbate conditions for thousands of refugees reliant on UNRWA's services. The bill’s passage would not only restore funding but also reinforce the United States' commitment to humanitarian efforts in the region, promoting stability and supporting a peaceful resolution to ongoing conflicts.

With this legislation, the House aims to reaffirm its stance on the importance of UNRWA's role in mitigating the spread of disease and famine. The bill urges the Government of Israel to assist UNRWA in maintaining its neutrality and effectiveness, thereby fostering cooperation in humanitarian efforts. This bipartisan initiative reflects increased recognition of the complex challenges faced by Palestinian refugees and the implications for regional stability.

The UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act proposes a multi-faceted approach, including a comprehensive review of UNRWA's operations to enhance efficiency and transparency. Reports on UNRWA’s implementation of recommendations from an independent review group will be mandated biannually. If successful, this legislation could significantly impact humanitarian aid and contribute to addressing the pressing needs of an underserved population.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ed Case, D-HI, introduced the Indigenous Diplomacy and Engagement Act on March 27, 2025, aimed at enhancing U.S. diplomatic relations with Indigenous peoples worldwide. The proposed legislation seeks to establish an Office for Indigenous Affairs to promote engagement and cooperation between the U.S. government and Indigenous communities, both domestically and internationally.

The Act emphasizes the need for a comprehensive strategy to foster relationships with Indigenous populations across various nations, given that there are approximately 476 million Indigenous individuals globally. It recognizes the significant challenges these communities face, including the preservation of their ancestral lands, cultures, and rights. By enhancing U.S. involvement with international Indigenous groups, the bill aims to support their goals and strengthen mutual interests.

This legislation comes in the wake of increasing global awareness of Indigenous rights, acknowledging prior international commitments made under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The bill outlines essential components for the new Office, including the appointment of a Coordinator for Indigenous Affairs, who will report directly to the Secretary of State and have ambassadorial rank.

The strategy mandated by the Act requires periodic assessment and development of specific goals regarding diplomacy with Indigenous communities. This includes identifying countries with significant Indigenous populations and evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. diplomatic efforts in those regions. By fostering multi-departmental collaboration, the Office's role is crucial in coordinating policies and resources aimed at enhancing these engagements.

As discussions surrounding global Indigenous rights continue to gain momentum, the Indigenous Diplomacy and Engagement Act represents a pivotal step towards a more inclusive U.S. foreign policy that respects and uplifts Indigenous voices on the global stage.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2413",40434,"Rep. Casten Introduces GREEN Appraisals Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the GREEN Appraisals Act, aimed at enhancing the valuation of residential properties through the integration of energy efficiency and renewable energy features in mortgage appraisals. This legislative initiative seeks to provide homeowners and prospective buyers the opportunity to include energy reports in their mortgage evaluations, potentially influencing appraisal values and financing options.

The bill was motivated by a growing recognition of the impact energy-efficient homes have on the environment and their long-term cost savings. As housing markets increasingly prioritize sustainability, providing accurate appraisals that reflect a home's energy characteristics is imperative. By mandating that energy reports be considered during appraisals, the bill intends to help homeowners demonstrate the financial benefits of energy-efficient improvements.

In addition to influencing appraisal processes, the GREEN Appraisals Act outlines clear guidelines for creditors on how to incorporate energy data into their underwriting practices. Starting March 1, 2026, creditors are to supply appraisers with energy reports, allowing for a thorough assessment of a property’s energy efficiency during the appraisal process. This is expected to not only elevate the appraised value of energy-efficient homes but also enhance access to affordable financing options for borrowers seeking energy-efficient properties.

The bill has been referred to both the House Financial Services Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Its potential impact is significant, aligning with national goals to improve energy sustainability in housing and foster a market that accurately reflects the value of energy efficiency. The broader aim is to encourage homeowners to invest in renewable energy features, ultimately contributing to a more energy-conscious housing market.

The bill (H.R. 2413) was introduced on 03/27/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kathy Castor, D-FL, has introduced a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, aiming to reauthorize a vital military and civilian partnership aimed at improving trauma readiness. This initiative seeks to enhance collaboration between military and civilian healthcare providers, facilitating better responses to trauma situations.

The bill responds to growing concerns about trauma care readiness in both civilian and military settings, particularly highlighted during recent national emergencies and conflicts. By fostering this partnership, the program aims to ensure that both sectors are equipped to handle traumatic injuries more effectively, ultimately saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

If passed, the legislation will extend the grant program from fiscal years 2025 through 2029, allowing continued investment in training and resources. This program has historically provided critical funding to organizations that develop innovative strategies for trauma care, establishing a framework where military expertise can inform civilian practices and vice versa.

The impact of the bill could be significant, as it not only aims to enhance medical preparedness but also promotes the sharing of best practices between the military and civilian healthcare systems. This collaboration is essential for managing complex trauma cases, especially in mass casualty incidents or natural disasters.

Furthermore, the reauthorization comes at a time when many hospitals face challenges in maintaining sufficient trauma care capabilities due to workforce shortages and increasing patient loads. By enabling more effective training and resources, the partnership aims to fortify the trauma care infrastructure across the United States.

Castor, alongside co-sponsor Rep. Richard Hudson, emphasizes the necessity of this program in bridging critical gaps in trauma care and enhancing overall public health safety. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2415",40434,"Rep. Cohen Introduces Baseball Diplomacy Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the Baseball Diplomacy Act, aiming to facilitate the participation of Cuban nationals in organized professional baseball within the United States. This legislation seeks to waive longstanding restrictions that have limited the ability of Cuban players to enter the U.S. for baseball opportunities.

The impetus behind this bill stems from the recognition of the rich tradition of baseball in Cuba and the vibrant talent of its players. Many Cuban athletes have demonstrated exceptional skill and have sought to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. However, current embargo laws pose significant challenges, complicating their ability to travel and compete in the U.S. The Baseball Diplomacy Act aims to remove these barriers by allowing Cuban nationals to enter the U.S. on special visas for the duration of the baseball season, while also ensuring they can return to Cuba with their earned income.

This bill has the potential to significantly impact both MLB and the Cuban economy. By easing the process for Cuban athletes to join U.S. teams, it can enhance the level of play in professional baseball and create new avenues for cultural exchange. Additionally, this move is expected to build goodwill between the United States and Cuba, strengthening diplomatic relations through shared passions.

The Baseball Diplomacy Act represents a strategic shift in U.S. policy regarding Cuba, promoting sports as a means of fostering connections. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be reviewed by both the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees, where discussions around its implications will take place. If enacted, this legislation could pave the way for a new era in professional baseball and international cooperation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act, aimed at enhancing the management and oversight of software assets across federal agencies. The bill emphasizes comprehensive assessments of software usage and entitlements, seeking to improve accountability and transparency in federal software asset management.

The act responds to ongoing concerns regarding inefficient software procurement and utilization within governmental operations. Many agencies struggle with duplicate software licenses and varying degrees of software interoperability, leading to unnecessary expenditures.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, has introduced the Federal Reserve Regulatory Oversight Act aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability within the Federal Reserve System. This legislation seeks to amend the Federal Reserve Act, specifically bringing the non-monetary policy-related functions of the Board of Governors under the appropriations process.

The Federal Reserve has been a central figure in the U.S. economic landscape, tasked with conducting monetary policy and overseeing financial institutions. However, concerns have arisen regarding the board’s regulatory operations that fall outside monetary policy. By incorporating these functions into the appropriations process, Davidson's bill aims to ensure that expenditures related to regulatory activities are subject to Congressional oversight. This includes costs associated with supervision, regulation, and operational tasks that support these regulatory duties.

The introduction of the bill is significant, as it comes amid ongoing debates about the Federal Reserve's independence and its broader role in the economy. Critics argue that increased oversight could lead to political interference, while proponents argue it is necessary for maintaining accountability in how taxpayer funds are utilized. The bill aims to establish clearer financial accountability by requiring that the Federal Reserve collects fees and assessments to cover its operational costs, thereby minimizing the reliance on general government funding.

Davidson’s proposal has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further evaluation. If enacted, this act could reshape the dynamics of the Federal Reserve’s financial operations and strengthen the link between federal oversight and the financial regulatory framework. This potential shift in operations highlights a pivotal phase in U.S. economic policy, as stakeholders seek to balance independence with accountability.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, introduced the Patient Fairness Act, a bill aimed at expanding access to health savings accounts (HSAs) for all individuals. The legislation was presented to address the growing need for more flexible healthcare financing options, particularly as healthcare costs continue to rise across the nation.

The Patient Fairness Act proposes significant reforms to existing HSA regulations, allowing all individuals to deduct contributions without the current eligibility restrictions tied to health plans. This change is designed to empower more Americans to save for healthcare expenses, ultimately increasing financial security for families. Additionally, the bill seeks to enhance contribution limits, allowing individuals to contribute up to $8,000 annually, which doubles for joint filers, plus an extra $3,000 for dependents. It also features provisions for individuals aged 55 and over to contribute additional funds, recognizing the unique healthcare needs of older Americans.

These legislative changes were introduced in response to concerns about inadequate access to affordable healthcare options, particularly during a time when many Americans are facing increased out-of-pocket expenses. By broadening the eligibility for HSAs and allowing higher contribution limits, the Patient Fairness Act aims to ensure that more citizens can better manage their health expenses.

Furthermore, the bill includes provisions aimed at improving price transparency in hospitals, working towards clearer communication regarding the costs of medical services. Rep. Davidson emphasized the importance of transparency, positing that clear pricing will facilitate informed consumer choices in healthcare services.

If passed, the Patient Fairness Act has the potential to reshape the way Americans save for healthcare, ultimately leading to a more equitable system better suited for today’s economic realities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-WA, has introduced the Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act aimed at safeguarding the operational integrity of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bill mandates that any functions of the Department of Homeland Security imposed on IRS personnel must be preceded by an evaluation from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. 

The introduction of this bill comes amid concerns regarding the potential diversion of IRS resources to fulfill Homeland Security responsibilities. Lawmakers worry that such changes could impede the IRS's primary mission of ensuring taxpayer compliance and delivering quality service. The bill seeks to ensure that IRS personnel are adequately trained for any additional functions to maintain the agency’s reliability and public trust.

If passed, the Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act will require the Treasury Inspector General to issue a determination confirming that IRS staff can handle these responsibilities without compromising taxpayer services. Notably, this includes ensuring that the agency can effectively enforce tax laws while remaining committed to fairness and accuracy in its operations.

The potential impact of this legislation extends beyond bureaucratic regulations, as it addresses the ongoing tension between national security and taxpayer services. As resource allocation debates continue, this bill aims to prioritize the integrity of tax administration while preventing any potential overreach by the Department of Homeland Security.

DelBene’s initiative reflects a growing bipartisan concern regarding the appropriateness of assigning IRS staff to homeland security duties. By maintaining a clear distinction between these roles, the Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act seeks to uphold the foundational principles upon which the IRS was established, ensuring it can fully concentrate on its primary tasks of aiding taxpayers and enforcing tax laws. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the CAPE Canaveral Act, aimed at relocating the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to Brevard County, Florida.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2423",40434,"Rep. Estes Introduces Unfair Tax Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced the Unfair Tax Prevention Act aimed at modifying the application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) as it relates to foreign entities linked to jurisdictions that impose extraterritorial taxes. This bill, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to address concerns that the current tax regime unfairly impacts U.S. businesses with foreign ownership under specific circumstances.

The Unfair Tax Prevention Act arises in response to increasing reports that companies face tax liabilities from foreign jurisdictions that impose taxes based on profits linked to U.S. operations. By altering the BEAT's provisions, the legislation aims to relieve U.S. entities from potential double taxation that arises from these extraterritorial levies. Specifically, the bill delineates rules for determining the tax responsibilities of foreign-owned entities and aims to clarify when such taxes apply, specifically targeting those connected with foreign countries imposing extraterritorial taxes.

The potential impact of this bill hinges on alleviating the financial burden on U.S. companies engaged in international trade and operations, particularly those with foreign affiliates. Supporters argue that such reforms could enhance the competitiveness of U.S. businesses in the global market by eliminating the threat of dual taxation and creating a more favorable business environment.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means for review, its advocates anticipate that it will foster bipartisan support, given the increasing emphasis on protecting American economic interests in a complex global tax landscape. The introduction of this legislation marks a significant step toward addressing growing concerns related to international taxation and its repercussions on U.S. businesses operating abroad.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pat Fallon, R-TX, has introduced the Veterans Mental Health and Addiction Therapy Quality of Care Act, aimed at enhancing the quality of mental health and addiction treatment for veterans by comparing the services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with those from non-VA healthcare providers.

The motivation behind this legislation stems from ongoing concerns regarding the effectiveness and accessibility of mental health care for veterans. Reports of long wait times and varying quality in treatment options highlight the need for an in-depth analysis of current practices. This bill seeks to address such concerns by mandating an independent study that evaluates the quality of care veterans receive across various treatment modalities, including telehealth, outpatient services, and inpatient therapies.

If enacted, the bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to partner with an external organization to conduct the study. The findings would be crucial for identifying gaps in service delivery and areas needing improvement. The independent assessment is expected to compare outcomes based on treatment duration and effectiveness while determining if practices align with established evidence-based medicine standards.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as improving mental health care is essential for addressing rising suicide rates among veterans. A comprehensive understanding of the differences in care quality could lead to more effective and integrated approaches tailored to veterans' unique needs. The study aims to be completed within 18 months, and its results will be shared with Congress and made publicly available to enhance transparency.

As it stands, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where it awaits further discussion and possible amendments.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Laura Friedman, D-CA, has introduced the Wildfire Homeowner Relief Act, aiming to address the challenges faced by homeowners in areas prone to catastrophic wildfires. This bill mandates the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a comprehensive study on a federal buyout program for homeowners willing to sell properties located in high-risk wildfire zones.

The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, fueled by climate change, have placed enormous stress on communities across California and other western states. Many residents in these high-risk areas have reported devastating losses as wildfires threaten their homes and livelihoods. The proposed bill seeks to mitigate these threats by investigating the feasibility of a federal buyout program that would allow homeowners to voluntarily sell their properties before and after a wildfire disaster occurs.

If enacted, this legislation could have significant implications for both individuals and communities. The study will evaluate existing federal grant programs and provide recommendations for a new program that focuses specifically on wildfire risk, glancing at successful buyout strategies from other disaster scenarios. Additionally, it will explore long-term land use plans aimed at reducing future wildfire risks and enhancing community safety.

In producing its report, due within a year of enactment, the Comptroller General will offer crucial insights into how local governments can best utilize buyouts, establish a national database for tracking these transactions, and ensure that financial resources effectively reach those in need. Given the ongoing challenges of climate change and disaster preparedness, the Wildfire Homeowner Relief Act reflects a proactive approach in supporting at-risk homeowners and fostering more resilient communities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced a new bill aimed at directing the Secretary of Transportation to develop a comprehensive Campus Modernization Plan for the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA). The legislation seeks to update the Academy’s aging infrastructure and facilities to provide current and future Midshipmen with the modern educational resources necessary for effective training.

In recent years, critics have highlighted that many of the facilities at the USMMA date back to its founding and have not undergone significant modernization. The proposed plan aims to ensure that these facilities meet today’s educational standards, addressing both academic training and physical readiness for future graduates. This update is essential, as graduates play a crucial role in the national defense and are notably integral to the U.S. Navy's Strategic Sealift Officer Program.

Furthermore, the bill points out that the modernization will not only enhance the educational experience but will also contribute to national security. Upgrading facilities to state-of-the-art standards is vital as the demand for qualified service-obligated licensed merchant mariners continues to grow. The bill is designed to create a more conducive learning environment, enabling Midshipmen to excel academically while preparing them for their commitments in both commercial maritime operations and national defense roles.

The Campus Modernization Plan will be informed by existing proposals and studies, such as the “Merchant Marine Academy Full Speed Ahead Plan.” Additionally, a significant budget allocation of $1.02 billion has been proposed over ten years to support infrastructure improvements. This investment reflects a commitment to maintaining the USMMA's status as a premier training institution for the maritime industry, ultimately ensuring it remains a vital component of U.S. maritime capabilities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brandon Gill, R-TX, has introduced a bill aimed at establishing a single, unique ZIP Code for the town of Northlake, Texas. This legislation, if passed, would direct the United States Postal Service (USPS) to implement this change within 270 days of the bill's enactment.

The necessity for this bill stems from Northlake's growing population and the existing complications that arise from sharing ZIP Codes with neighboring areas. Currently, several neighborhoods within Northlake are utilizing the same ZIP Code as surrounding towns, which can lead to confusion in mail delivery, emergency services, and local identity. By designating a unique ZIP Code specifically for Northlake, proponents argue that it will streamline communication and enhance service efficiency for residents.

The potential impact of this bill could be significant. A dedicated ZIP Code would not only facilitate more accurate mail delivery but could also foster a greater sense of community pride and identity. Additionally, with Northlake experiencing rapid growth and development, the introduction of a unique postal code may enhance local business visibility and economic development efforts.

Historically, rural and suburban areas have struggled with the administrative hurdles of shared ZIP Codes. Many local officials have noted that designating unique postal identifiers helps facilitate better resource allocation and service delivery. As such, this bill aligns with a broader push towards improving infrastructure and public services in rapidly growing locales.

As the legislation moves forward, it has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. If successful, the bill will empower Northlake to establish its unique postal identity, ultimately benefiting its residents and businesses alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sam Graves, R-MO, has introduced the Southwestern Power Administration Fund Establishment Act aimed at creating a dedicated fund to support the operations and management of the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA). The fund, to be established in the U.S. Treasury, will facilitate power transmission, marketing, and maintenance operations crucial for the energy infrastructure in the region.

This bill is part of a broader effort to modernize and secure funding for the SWPA, which has faced financial constraints in recent years. By establishing this dedicated fund, the Administration aims to streamline budgeting processes and ensure that resources are allocated specifically for power transmission and related projects. The fund would consist of various receipts, including appropriated funds and transfer of unexpended balances from existing accounts, ensuring a steady flow of financial resources.

The impact of this legislation could be significant for the energy landscape in the Southwestern United States. By ensuring that the SWPA has more reliable funding, the bill aims to enhance the resilience of power infrastructure, potentially leading to improved reliability of electricity supply and support for renewable energy initiatives in the region. As power demands increase and infrastructure ages, this act could be a pivotal step in modernizing the energy framework essential to supporting local economies.

The SEC’s provisions emphasize transparency and accountability, requiring any excess funds in the newly established account to be returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. This legislation is now referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Appropriations for further consideration, representing a promising step forward in energy administration reform.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark E. Green, R-TN, has introduced the Reducing Medically Unnecessary Delays in Care Act of 2025 aimed at streamlining the prior authorization process for healthcare services under Medicare. The legislation seeks to ensure that medical necessity decisions are made exclusively by practicing physicians rather than administrative contractors, thereby reducing unnecessary delays in patient care.

The bill addresses growing concerns about the hurdles patients face in receiving timely medical treatments. Reports indicate that patients frequently experience prolonged waiting periods for approval of necessary medical procedures, leading to adverse health outcomes. By mandating that decisions regarding care are informed by clinical expertise, the new legislation aims to safeguard patient access to timely healthcare.

Under the proposed changes, Medicare administrative contractors and Medicare Advantage plans would be required to base coverage determinations solely on well-established clinical guidelines and standards, removing administrative barriers to care. This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance healthcare efficiencies while prioritizing patient welfare, particularly in urgent medical situations.

Historically, the Medicare system has faced criticism for cumbersome prior authorization protocols that often hinder patient access to necessary services. The new act proposes to implement evidence-based practices that align medical decisions with actual healthcare needs rather than administrative interests, potentially improving overall patient satisfaction and outcomes.

Supporters of the bill believe that it could lead to a significant reduction in healthcare delays and foster a more responsive and patient-centered healthcare system.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2478",40434,"Rep. Wagner Introduces Financial Exploitation Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ann Wagner, R-MO, has introduced the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, aimed at enhancing protections for vulnerable adults against financial exploitation. The proposed legislation seeks to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 by allowing registered open-end investment companies to postpone the redemption of securities if there is reasonable suspicion of financial exploitation involving specified adults.

The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act arises in response to the growing concern over the financial abuse of older adults and other vulnerable individuals, particularly in the context of investment activities. The bill addresses the alarming trend of financial exploitation, which often results in significant losses for those affected. By enabling investment firms to delay securities redemption, the bill aims to provide critical time for necessary investigations into potentially fraudulent activities.

Under the proposed legislation, investment companies would be required to document and retain certain customer information to assist in identifying signs of exploitation. If exploitation is suspected, these companies can postpone redeeming securities for up to 15 business days, with the potential for an additional 10-day extension if necessary, as long as the appropriate notices are given and a review is conducted.

The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act aims to safeguard adults aged 65 and older as well as any individual over 18 who may have impairments preventing them from protecting their financial interests. If passed, this bill represents a significant step toward proactive measures in the fight against financial exploitation, emphasizing the need for enhanced vigilance and a structured response from investment firms.

Wagner's initiative is backed by several bipartisan co-sponsors and is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Financial Services.

The bill (H.R. 2478) introduced on 03/27/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Gottheimer, Josh [D-NJ-5]...03/27/2025; Rep. Garbarino, Andrew R. [R-NY-2]...03/27/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jill Tokuda, D-HI, has introduced the Stop Illegal Campaign Coordination Act, aimed at amending the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to clarify the treatment of certain expenditures in political campaigns. The proposed legislation seeks to ensure that any expenditure materially consistent with instructions from candidates or political committees is considered coordinated, which would impose stricter regulations on campaign financing.

The bill is a direct response to growing concerns over the intertwining of outside spending and candidate campaigns, especially following the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, which allowed for unrestricted independent expenditures. By establishing definitive criteria for what constitutes coordinated spending, the act aims to mitigate the influence of dark money in politics and promote transparency.

The potential impact of the Stop Illegal Campaign Coordination Act is significant; it could limit the effectiveness of independent expenditures that operate in tandem with candidates' campaigns without formally coordinating. Under the proposed changes, if a committee or candidate provides guidance on how funds should be spent or shared relevant information about target demographics, these expenditures would fall under stricter regulations, thereby enhancing accountability.

The emergence of this bill reflects a growing acknowledgment among lawmakers of the need for comprehensive campaign finance reform. While proponents argue it will strengthen the democratic process by reducing outside influence, critics suggest it poses challenges for independent groups advocating for various political causes. As the legislation moves through the House Administration Committee, it will likely ignite debate over the balance between free speech and the integrity of electoral processes.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emilia Strong Sykes, D-OH, has introduced the Healthy Food Access for All Americans Act aimed at enhancing access to nutritious food options in underserved areas, also known as food deserts. The proposed legislation establishes new tax credits and grant programs to incentivize grocery stores and food banks to operate in these communities.

The bill addresses a critical deficiency in many low-income areas, where access to fresh produce and healthy food options is severely limited. By offering financial incentives, the Healthy Food Access for All Americans Act seeks to increase the number of grocery stores and healthier food outlets in regions that currently lack these resources. Statistics show that a significant portion of low-income populations reside in areas where they cannot afford or access quality food, leading to higher rates of diet-related illnesses.

Under the act, certified special access food providers can receive tax credits of up to 15% for building new grocery stores or renovating existing ones. Additionally, a grant program will provide funds to food banks and temporary access merchants like farmers markets, thereby ensuring a wider distribution of nutritious food in food deserts.

The legislation also mandates annual updates to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Access Research Atlas, ensuring that policymakers have timely data on food retailers and can better target areas in need.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-VA, has introduced the COST of Relocations Act, a new legislative initiative aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in federal agency relocations. The bill mandates that federal agencies conduct comprehensive benefit-cost analyses before moving employment positions, ensuring that decision-makers assess the potential impacts on both employees and the agency's mission.

The introduction of the COST of Relocations Act comes in response to growing concerns regarding the efficiency of federal relocations and their effects on employee morale and public service delivery. By requiring detailed analyses, the legislation seeks to prevent poorly planned moves that may disrupt agency operations and lead to unnecessary costs. Advocates of the bill argue that thorough evaluations can provide valuable insights into the long-term implications of relocating federal jobs, thereby promoting fiscal responsibility and improved service outcomes.

Under the proposed bill, federal agencies would need to submit unredacted reports of their benefit-cost analyses to their respective Offices of Inspector General. These reports will detail the anticipated outcomes of relocations, including how they align with the agency's objectives and the necessary resources for successful implementation. The Office of Inspector General will play a crucial role in reviewing these analyses and reporting their findings to Congress.

This legislation reflects ongoing efforts to ensure that federal government practices align with accountability standards and best practices in management. If enacted, the COST of Relocations Act would mark a significant shift in how federal relocations are approached, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning and stakeholder engagement while safeguarding taxpayer interests.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-WA, has introduced the Abortion DOULAS Act aiming to evaluate the benefits and accessibility of abortion doula care. The legislation mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a comprehensive study on the impact of abortion doulas, who provide emotional, informational, and logistical support to individuals seeking abortions.

The rise of this bill comes in the wake of growing concerns about access to reproductive healthcare post-Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. This pivotal Supreme Court decision significantly affected abortion rights, leading to heightened barriers, especially for marginalized communities. Strickland's initiative recognizes the importance of doulas in navigating these challenges, especially for those facing systemic barriers to care.

The proposed study will assess how abortion doula care influences patient experience and outcomes, focusing on the support provided before, during, and after abortion procedures. By highlighting the role of doulas in various settings—including hospitals, clinics, and home visits—this legislation seeks to validate and potentially integrate this support into broader healthcare frameworks.

Furthermore, the bill addresses existing barriers to accessing doula care, such as limited awareness and financial constraints, particularly among communities of color and low-income individuals. The legislation aims not only to gather data but also to provide actionable recommendations to improve Medicaid and insurance coverage for doula services, ensuring that essential support is accessible to all individuals.

The Abortion DOULAS Act represents a significant step towards enhancing comprehensive reproductive healthcare, and it emphasizes the necessity of cultural competence and patient advocacy in supporting those undergoing abortions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the No Sanctions Relief for Terrorists Act, aimed at tightening restrictions on Iran by prohibiting any waivers or licenses that would relieve sanctions imposed against individuals and entities involved in terrorism.

The legislative move comes amid increasing concerns over Iran's continued support for various terrorist organizations and activities that undermine regional stability. By enforcing stricter sanctions, the bill seeks to hold Iranian entities accountable under U.S. law, significantly impacting ongoing diplomatic negotiations with Tehran.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2462",40434,"Rep. Rose Introduces Black Vulture Relief Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John W. Rose, R-TN, has introduced the Black Vulture Relief Act aimed at allowing livestock producers and their staff to take necessary measures against black vultures that threaten their livestock. This legislation seeks to authorize the capture or dispersal of these birds to prevent injury or death to livestock while complying with federal wildlife regulations.

The bill was motivated by growing concerns among farmers over the increasing population of black vultures, which have been known to harm livestock, particularly in rural areas. These birds pose a significant threat to young or weak animals, leading farmers to report substantial losses. With overreaching federal protections in place for migratory birds, the act aims to provide farmers more leeway to protect their livelihoods without infringing upon wildlife conservation efforts.

Should the bill pass, livestock producers will be able to take black vultures that pose an imminent threat, effectively addressing the human-wildlife conflict in agricultural regions. However, the bill explicitly prohibits the use of poison as a method for taking these birds, emphasizing a controlled and responsible approach to wildlife management.

The Black Vulture Relief Act also includes provisions for reporting incidents involving vultures, requiring producers to submit annual reports to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service about their activities. This reporting mechanism ensures that while local farmers gain additional rights to protect their livestock, biological data on vulture interactions is still collected to inform future wildlife management strategies.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-CA, has introduced the Reclaim Trade Powers Act, aiming to amend the Trade Act of 1974 by eliminating the authority to impose import surcharges used to address balance of payments deficits. This legislation seeks to reshape U.S. trade policy by restricting certain governmental powers in maintaining trade balances.

The impetus behind the bill arises from ongoing concerns regarding the effectiveness and fairness of import surcharges that impact both consumers and international trade relations. Critics argue that these surcharges can distort market competition and disproportionately affect low-income families by raising prices on imported goods. By removing this authority, the Reclaim Trade Powers Act intends to bolster a more equitable and transparent approach to trade, promoting fairness in pricing and competition.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it could alter how the U.S. engages in international trade negotiations. Supporters believe that a more defined trade policy could favor domestic producers by ensuring a level playing field without the imposition of surcharges that could deter foreign competition. This legislative move could also signal to trading partners that the U.S. is committed to fair trade practices, encouraging reciprocal policies.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further discussion and potential amendments. The committee will examine the efficacy of existing trade laws and consider how the proposed changes could coincide with ongoing economic challenges, particularly relating to inflation and supply chain disruptions.

If passed, the Reclaim Trade Powers Act could mark a pivotal shift in U.S. trade policy, reflecting a re-evaluation of how the government manages its international economic engagements.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nathaniel Moran, R-TX, has introduced the Orderly Liquidation of the Department of Education Act, a controversial bill aimed at terminating the federal education department. The legislation, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to transfer the responsibilities of education back to state and local authorities, asserting that the Department of Education has not effectively improved educational quality in the U.S. since its inception 45 years ago.

The proposal stems from arguments that the existing federal oversight not only limits local control but also fails to meet the educational needs of students nationwide. Supporters of the bill believe that dismantling the department will allow for more tailored and efficient education policies at the state and community levels. The act proposes a scheduled termination of the Department of Education by October 1, 2026, with a detailed plan for transferring its functions to various state and federal entities, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice.

If passed, the legislation could significantly alter the educational landscape in America, potentially reallocating extensive federal funds and oversight functions previously managed by the Department of Education. Critics express concern that such a move could disrupt existing programs, particularly those supporting low-income and marginalized students. They argue that terminating a centralized authority could lead to disparities in educational quality and access across states.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further review. As the debate unfolds, it remains to be seen how this significant shift in education policy will be received by stakeholders across the spectrum. Supporters and opponents alike are already mobilizing to express their views on the implications of this legislative effort.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dave Min, D-CA, introduced the Special Government Employees Transparency Act of 2025, aiming to enhance the accountability and disclosure of special government employees (SGEs). The proposed legislation seeks to limit the employment duration of SGEs to 130 days within a calendar year while establishing a public database containing critical information about these employees.

The bill addresses growing concerns about the use of special government employees, who often occupy roles that can influence federal policy without the same level of scrutiny as regular government employees. Currently, SGEs are used across various agencies, leading to questions about transparency and oversight. By capping their service time, the legislation aims to ensure that such roles do not become permanent fixtures that evade the usual checks and balances in government employment.

Additionally, the Act mandates the creation of a searchable database listing details such as names, titles, pay rates, and employment dates of SGEs, which would be accessible to the public without charge. The introduction of this requirement aims to empower citizens by fostering greater transparency about who is influencing government decisions and policies.

This legislative push comes in a politically charged environment, where calls for improved government transparency and ethical oversight have intensified. The growing public interest in governmental accountability may contribute to the bill's favorable reception in Congress, as lawmakers seek to align themselves with constituents advocating for reform.

Debates surrounding immigration often polarize lawmakers, making this bill likely subject to extensive discussions within congressional committees.

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further review. As lawmakers weigh the implications of the No Citizenship for Alien Invaders Act, public and legislative discourse will likely focus on its effects on community integration, the legal system for immigrants, and the overall approach to border control in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2434",40434,"Rep. Grothman Introduces No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-WI, has introduced the No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act, aimed at prohibiting the use of tax-exempt bonds for financing professional sports stadiums. This proposed legislation seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code by clarifying that any bonds issued to support stadium projects will not receive tax-exempt status.

This bill arises amid increasing concerns over taxpayer funding being directed towards professional sports facilities that seemingly benefit private entities. Critics argue that such tax breaks amount to subsidies that disproportionately advantage wealthy franchise owners while burdening public finances. Grothman’s initiative signifies a shift towards demanding accountability in the utilization of taxpayer dollars and addressing inequities in public investment.

By clarifying the definition of professional stadium bonds, the legislation ensures that any financial instruments supporting the capital expenditures of sports arenas will not benefit from tax exemptions, thereby intending to reduce the financial strain on taxpayers. The act will apply to all bonds issued after its enactment, thereby creating a future landscape in which local governments can no longer easily finance luxury stadiums with taxpayer-backed funds. 

Proponents of this legislation assert that reallocating these funds towards schools, infrastructure, and essential services will foster greater public welfare. Meanwhile, sports leagues and team owners have expressed concerns about the potential impacts on their ability to finance state-of-the-art facilities, which they argue are vital for competitiveness and community engagement.

As the House Committee on Ways and Means begins to review the bill, the outcome will shape future discussions about the appropriateness of public financing for privately owned enterprises in American sports.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2435",40434,"Rep. Hayes Introduces Save Our Small Farms Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-CT, has introduced the Save Our Small Farms Act, aimed at providing critical support for small-scale farmers across the United States. This bipartisan initiative seeks to amend the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act to enhance the noninsured crop disaster assistance program, making it more accessible and beneficial for farmers.

The bill focuses on reducing costs associated with crop coverage and minimizing paperwork burdens, thereby making assistance easier to access. It includes provisions for increasing the payouts under the program, which will help farmers recover more effectively from adverse conditions. This comes in response to ongoing challenges small farms face, including unpredictable weather patterns and market fluctuations, which have threatened their viability.

The Save Our Small Farms Act also incentivizes farmers to transition to comprehensive insurance policies through the whole farm risk management insurance plan. By offering progressive premium discounts, the legislation aims to encourage participants to commit to a sustainable insurance approach, which enhances their long-term financial resilience.

In recent years, small farms have been vital to the economy but have struggled with profitability and sustainability. This bill encourages innovation in agricultural practices, including the adoption of diversified production systems. Furthermore, it expands eligibility for insurance and includes provisions for producers marketing directly to consumers, thus ensuring that a wider array of farms can benefit from the program.

Hayes’ bill reflects a growing recognition of the importance of supporting small farmers, who are often left vulnerable in times of crisis. The Agriculture Committee will review the proposal in the coming weeks, marking a significant step toward strengthening the agricultural backbone of the nation. If passed, this act could be a lifeline for countless farmers striving to keep their operations afloat.

The bill (H.R. 2435) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2436",40434,"Rep. Hern Introduces Bill to Allow Funeral Expenses from Health Savings Accounts","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kevin Hern, R-OK, has introduced a bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to enable distributions from health savings accounts (HSAs) for funeral expenses to be treated as qualified distributions. This legislative effort seeks to ease the financial burden on families during times of grief by allowing them to utilize funds in HSAs for expenses associated with the death of an account beneficiary.

The bill arises from growing concerns about the costs associated with funerals, which can be prohibitively expensive for many families. By enabling HSAs to cover these expenses, the proposed change could relieve some financial strain, especially during an already challenging emotional time. Under the proposed legislation, funeral expenses would include a range of costs, such as burial or cremation, transportation of remains, cemetery plot fees, and various services related to funeral arrangements.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it directly addresses the intersection of healthcare financing and end-of-life expenses, areas often overlooked in current policy frameworks. Currently, HSAs allow individuals to save for healthcare expenses tax-free, but funeral costs are typically excluded. This change could prompt families to better plan for unforeseen end-of-life expenses and secure their financial future.

As it stands, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. If passed, it would not only reinterpret HSA use but also highlight the need for broader discussions on financial planning for healthcare and end-of-life services, an issue increasingly relevant in America’s aging population.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the Foster Care Tax Credit Act, designed to provide much-needed financial support to foster families. This legislation aims to create a refundable tax credit of $850 for eligible foster parents, alleviating some of the financial burdens associated with caring for foster children.

The bill was introduced in response to the increasing costs faced by foster families, particularly those caring for multiple children or experiencing emergency placements. By offering a tax credit, lawmakers hope to encourage more families to foster children in need, thereby helping to reduce the number of youths in institutional care. The legislation establishes the eligibility criteria, which include having a qualifying foster child placed for at least one month within the taxable year and not receiving certain other tax benefits.

The Foster Care Tax Credit Act is seen as a pivotal step in promoting foster care and supporting families who undertake this vital responsibility. Foster care advocates have long called for financial relief to ensure that those who take in vulnerable children are better supported and incentivized. According to the National Foster Care Association, stable and well-supported foster homes are crucial for improving the outcomes of children in care.

If passed, this act could enhance the foster care system's appeal and effectiveness by making it more viable for everyday families to participate. The legislation has been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, as well as the Committee on Education and Workforce, for further consideration. Should it advance, the bill could represent a significant policy shift, acknowledging the critical role foster families play in the welfare of children in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2439",40434,"Rep. Houlahan Introduces Support UNFPA Funding Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-PA, has introduced the Support UNFPA Funding Act, a legislative measure aimed at authorizing contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The bill seeks to bolster funding for critical reproductive health programs, aiming to improve maternal health, provide family planning services, and combat gender-based violence globally.

This bill was initiated in response to a growing recognition of the essential role that UNFPA plays in promoting health and stability in more than 150 countries. With nearly 800 women and adolescent girls dying every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, the act intends to reverse cuts in funding that have jeopardized vital support for these populations. UNFPA has demonstrated its effectiveness and adherence to rigorous standards, assuring that U.S. funds are used appropriately without supporting abortion services. 

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, particularly in low-income regions where access to reproductive health care is severely limited. Houlahan's bill authorizes at least $50 million for fiscal year 2026 and $55 million for fiscal year 2027, designating these funds to address maternal mortality, unmet contraceptive needs, and harmful practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation. This funding aims not only to save lives but also to empower women by delivering essential health care services and education.

As international instability grows alongside demands for comprehensive health services, the Support UNFPA Funding Act stands at a crucial intersection of health policy and humanitarian aid, reaffirming the United States' commitment to addressing global health challenges and promoting women's rights worldwide.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2440",40434,"Rep. Hudson Introduces SIFIA Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, has introduced the School Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (SIFIA) aimed at improving school facilities across the nation through innovative financing options. This legislation seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the issuance of tax credit bonds specifically designated for financing projects related to school infrastructure, providing potential savings for school districts and enhancing educational environments.

The SIFIA Act addresses longstanding challenges in funding for school infrastructure, which has become increasingly pressing as many educational facilities fall into disrepair or fail to meet modern energy efficiency standards. With an estimated $10 billion in total bond issuances earmarked for such projects, the Act prioritizes the development of net-zero energy buildings that align with the sustainability goals of numerous school districts.

By targeting projects in both urban and rural areas, the bill allocates $1 billion specifically for rural school infrastructure improvements, enhancing access to quality education in underserved communities. School districts will be incentivized to partner with qualified private entities for the construction and operation of these facilities, with a commitment for the eventual transfer of ownership back to the schools.

Potential impacts of the SIFIA Act include increased employment in construction and education sectors, improved student performance due to better learning environments, and energy savings for school districts that can result from the proposed net-zero buildings. As education officials rally behind the Act, it represents a significant step toward revitalizing American education infrastructure, reflecting a commitment to future generations of students. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2441",40434,"Rep. Huizenga Introduces Improving Disclosure for Investors Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-MI, has introduced the Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2025, aimed at modernizing how regulatory documents are delivered to investors. The bill mandates the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the electronic delivery of specific regulatory documents, making investor communications more efficient and accessible.

The impetus behind this legislation stems from a growing demand for digital solutions in financial communications, particularly as technology evolves and more investors prefer electronic formats. Traditional delivery methods often delay access to crucial information, impacting investor decision-making processes. By enabling electronic delivery, the new bill seeks to streamline the exchange of essential documents like prospectuses, reports, and privacy notices.

The Act outlines specific requirements for electronic communications. It ensures that investors who do not opt for electronic delivery still receive vital initial notifications in paper form and allows them a transition period to adjust. Moreover, the SEC is tasked with ensuring that all electronic documents are readily accessible, readable, and that systems are in place to manage failed deliveries.

This change is expected to significantly impact both investors and financial entities by enhancing transparency and fostering investor confidence. The bill has the potential to reduce operational costs for financial institutions while updating compliance practices for the digital age. 

As the financial landscape evolves, Huizenga's proposal reflects a wider trend of leveraging technology for better service delivery in the finance sector. The legislation was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further review, signaling the beginning of the legislative process that could reshape how financial information is communicated in the future.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, has introduced the Freedom from Unfair Gun Taxes Act, which aims to prohibit states from implementing excise taxes on the sale of firearms, ammunition, and related components by manufacturers and dealers involved in interstate or foreign commerce. This legislation is designed to alleviate the financial burden on gun manufacturers and improve the accessibility of firearms.

The introduction of this bill follows increasing concerns among gun rights advocates about the financial impact of state-imposed taxes on the firearms industry. Proponents argue that such taxes disproportionately affect law-abiding citizens and could impede access to necessary firearms for self-defense and sporting activities. By eliminating these taxes, the bill seeks to foster a favorable economic environment for firearm-related businesses while promoting personal freedom.

In practical terms, the Freedom from Unfair Gun Taxes Act could stimulate economic growth in the firearms sector by reducing costs for consumers. The bill is anticipated to attract more businesses to the market, potentially leading to job creation and an increase in state revenues from sales and employment taxes, despite the elimination of excise taxes.

Historically, the firearms industry has faced various challenges due to fluctuating regulations and taxes at the state level. The proposed act aligns with ongoing efforts by various lawmakers to maximize Second Amendment rights while reducing bureaucratic hurdles for gun ownership and sales. As discussions progress in the House Judiciary Committee, the bill's fate remains uncertain, reflecting the ongoing divide in Congress over firearm regulations and taxation policies.

As the nation grapples with the complexities surrounding gun control and ownership, the Freedom from Unfair Gun Taxes Act will likely be a focal point in the debate on how best to balance regulation with constitutional rights.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-TX, has introduced a bill aiming to eliminate federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Known as the “NPR and PBS Act,” this legislation is positioned as a response to growing concerns about perceived partisanship within these broadcasting outlets.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst ongoing debates regarding the funding of public media and its implications for political discourse in America. Jackson and several co-sponsors argue that taxpayer dollars should not support organizations viewed as politically biased. The bill aims to prohibit any federal funds from being allocated to NPR and PBS, including indirect funding through public broadcasting stations' dues or programming purchases. 

Supporters of the bill claim that its passage would mark a significant move toward ensuring fiscal responsibility and preventing what they characterize as the use of taxpayer money for partisan purposes. They believe that reliance on audience donations and private funding would foster more neutrality and accountability in public broadcasting.

On the other hand, critics contend that the bill could undermine public access to quality educational programming and news. They emphasize the importance of NPR and PBS in providing diverse viewpoints and essential services to underserved populations, especially in rural areas where media outlets may be limited. 

As debates continue, the future of this legislation remains uncertain. It has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it will undergo further discussion. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle will likely evaluate its potential impact on public media and the broader implications for the dissemination of information in a democratic society.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John James, R-MI, has introduced the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act, aimed at bolstering the resilience of critical supply chains in the United States. This legislation seeks to establish a program within the Department of Commerce dedicated to ensuring American leadership in emerging technologies and enhancing the country's crisis response capabilities.

The bill was prompted by the increasing vulnerabilities exposed during recent global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, which have shown the limitations of existing supply chains. By promoting domestic production and fostering relationships with allied nations, the act aims to mitigate future disruptions and enhance national security. The legislation establishes a Critical Supply Chain Resilience Working Group, composed of various federal agencies, to assess current supply chains and develop strategies for resilience.

Under this framework, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce will play a pivotal role in leading efforts to elevate the stability of critical industries and technologies. The bill outlines responsibilities such as evaluating manufacturing capabilities and encouraging domestic enterprises to reduce dependency on imports from nations that present security risks. A focus on improving flexible manufacturing capacities is also a key tenet of the proposed legislation.

The act is expected to positively influence the U.S. manufacturing sector by promoting job creation in critical industries, ultimately contributing to economic stability and security. By identifying vulnerabilities and developing strategic contingency plans, the bill aims to secure a robust supply chain network adaptable to future challenges. If passed, this initiative could redefine the landscape of American manufacturing and set a precedent for future legislative efforts addressing supply chain vulnerabilities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-UT, has introduced the Ensuring Medicaid Eligibility Act aimed at prohibiting the implementation of a recently proposed Medicaid streamlining rule. The legislation seeks to reinforce eligibility verification by mandating states to ensure each applicant is either a U.S. citizen or holds satisfactory immigration status before enrollment.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to concerns from several legislators and citizens regarding the effectiveness of the current eligibility determination process. Advocates argue that the proposed streamlining rule, which was set to simplify application and enrollment processes, could potentially lead to increased instances of ineligible individuals receiving Medicaid benefits, creating unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.

Under the new legislation, the bill not only prohibits the implementation of the 2024 Medicaid streamlining rule but also requires regular eligibility verification for individuals who enroll based on income. This provision is intended to ensure that those who qualify for Medicaid are indeed eligible as defined under the law.

The impact of such a bill could be significant, potentially leading to a reduction in the number of individuals enrolled in the Medicaid program, particularly among immigrant populations. Supporters of the bill argue that it is crucial to maintain the integrity of public assistance programs while critics warn that it could create barriers for eligible individuals seeking medical assistance.

As the bill is referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, stakeholders on all sides are preparing to advocate their positions. If passed, this act could reshape the landscape of Medicaid eligibility in the U.S., balancing the demand for efficient processes with the necessity of verifying applicant status diligently.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Advancement Act aimed at promoting renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the country. The bill focuses on enhancing federal support for solar and wind energy projects, as well as providing incentives for businesses and homeowners to adopt clean energy technologies.

The Clean Energy Advancement Act emerges in response to growing concerns over climate change and the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions. As extreme weather patterns become more prevalent and the impacts of pollution are increasingly felt by communities, lawmakers are advocating for a transition to more environmentally friendly energy alternatives. The legislation seeks to allocate $10 billion in funding for renewable energy research and development, enabling innovations that could make clean energy more accessible and affordable.

Key features of the bill include tax credits for both residential and commercial properties that install solar panels, as well as grants for local governments to develop green infrastructure projects. By facilitating the growth of the clean energy sector, Rep. Smith's proposal aims to create thousands of new jobs while simultaneously addressing environmental issues. The bill also emphasizes the importance of educating the public on renewable energy and its benefits.

The introduction of the Clean Energy Advancement Act echoes a growing bipartisan sentiment in Congress, recognizing the need for comprehensive action against climate challenges. As various regions in the United States strive to meet ambitious sustainability goals, the bill is seen as a critical step towards ensuring a cleaner, healthier future.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-MI, has introduced the Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act to enhance oversight of pharmacy benefit management services and address skyrocketing prescription drug prices in the U.S. The bill aims to establish stricter reporting requirements for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), enabling consumers to gain clearer insights into drug pricing and reimbursements.

The legislation was prompted by increasing public concerns over high drug costs and the opaque nature of how prices are set and negotiated. With rising health care expenses impacting many Americans, this bill seeks to create accountability among PBMs by mandating detailed disclosures about pricing mechanisms and financial practices. 

Under this proposed law, PBMs will be required to submit biannual reports outlining compensation structures, out-of-pocket spending by patients, and details related to rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical companies. It will also empower consumers by ensuring that pivotal information is accessible and understandable, allowing patients to make more informed choices about their healthcare options.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. James P. McGovern, D-MA, has introduced the Deerfield River Wild and Scenic River Study Act, which seeks to initiate a comprehensive study of the Deerfield River’s suitability for inclusion in the national Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This legislation aims to assess the river's environmental, recreational, and historical importance and its potential designation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2452",40434,"Rep. Miller Introduces Keep Our Girls Safe Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mary E. Miller, R-IL, has introduced the Keep Our Girls Safe Act, aiming to amend Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 by strictly defining the use of locker room facilities in educational settings. The proposed legislation stipulates that only individuals of the same sex, based solely on their reproductive biology and genetics at birth, may use locker rooms currently in active use.

The bill was introduced in response to ongoing national debates surrounding transgender rights and the implications for women's sports and safety in educational institutions. Proponents assert that the legislation is necessary to ensure the privacy and safety of girls in school environments. It seeks to create a clear standard that would bolster compliance among educational institutions regarding locker room access.

If enacted, the Keep Our Girls Safe Act would prohibit individuals from using locker rooms that do not align with their birth-assigned sex while activities are ongoing. This move is perceived as both a protective measure for girls and a means to maintain the integrity of women's spaces in schools. 

This legislative effort comes during a contentious time when various states are considering or have passed similar laws targeting the rights of transgender individuals. By introducing this bill, Miller aligns with a group of Republican lawmakers advocating for measures they believe will protect women in education from what they view as potential intrusions from individuals who identify as a different gender. 

The act is currently referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where it will be examined for further consideration. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, the bill underscores the widening divide in public opinion regarding gender identity and rights in educational contexts.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2399",40434,"Rep. Houchin Introduces Rural Broadband Protection Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the Rural Broadband Protection Act, aiming to enhance accountability in the distribution of federal funds intended for broadband development in high-cost areas. This legislation seeks to establish a comprehensive vetting process for applicants seeking support from the high-cost universal service program, ensuring that only qualified providers receive funding.

The Rural Broadband Protection Act comes amid growing concerns about the effective deployment of broadband services, particularly in rural communities often left underserved. With increasing reliance on digital connectivity for education, healthcare, and economic activities, the legislation is designed to refine the funding process, maximizing the potential impact of public investments. 

Currently, there are minimal checks on who qualifies for these federal funds, leading to instances of ineligible providers receiving financial support. The proposed changes stipulate that applicants must demonstrate they possess the technical and financial capabilities to deliver quality service, an essential requirement if federal funds are to be used responsibly. Additionally, the bill mandates penalties for any pre-authorization defaults, aiming to deter non-compliance and promote accountability among recipients.

The vetting process will be overseen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which will have six months after the bill's passage to establish the necessary rules. The move has garnered attention as broadband access is increasingly viewed as a crucial determinant of economic viability in rural areas. By ensuring only capable providers can tap into federal resources, the bill aims to bolster efforts to close the digital divide, facilitating broader access to high-speed internet for underserved populations.

Overall, Rep. Houchin's initiative reflects a growing recognition of the need for systematic reform in the management of federal broadband funding to ensure it meets its intended objectives.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adrian Smith, R-NE, has introduced the Rural Veterinary Workforce Act, a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing support for veterinarians serving in rural areas. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax exclusion for assistance received by individuals participating in designated veterinary student loan repayment and forgiveness programs.

The Rural Veterinary Workforce Act has been introduced against a backdrop of growing concern over the shortage of veterinarians in rural communities, which often struggle to attract and retain qualified professionals. Many of these areas face significant challenges related to animal health care access, impacting both pet owners and agricultural producers.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adrian Smith, R-NE, introduced the Targeting TANF to Families in Need Act aimed at reforming financial assistance for low-income families through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This bill seeks to improve the targeting of TANF funds to ensure they effectively reach those who are most in need.

The legislation comes in response to ongoing concerns that current TANF distributions are not adequately focused on families living below or near the poverty line. By establishing a threshold for eligibility, the bill intends to direct resources specifically to families whose income is less than twice the federal poverty guidelines. This reform aims to address growing disparities in poverty relief efforts within the state-funded TANF program.

If enacted, the changes would take effect on October 1, 2026, which allows states time to adjust their program regulations accordingly. The proposed modification in funding distribution aligns with broader trends in social welfare policy aimed at ensuring targeted assistance that can more effectively combat poverty.

Currently, TANF supports families with children, providing them with cash assistance and services to help them become self-sufficient. Critics have argued that the program has faced significant challenges regarding accessibility and appropriate targeting, with many eligible families not receiving adequate support. The Targeting TANF to Families in Need Act is seen as a proactive measure that seeks to enhance program effectiveness and responsiveness amid rising living costs and economic pressures facing families across the nation.

As the legislation progresses through the House Committee on Ways and Means, it reflects an increased focus on elevating the welfare and economic stability of the most vulnerable households.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Honor Farmer Contracts Act, aimed at unfreezing significant funding for farmers and prohibiting the closure of essential agricultural offices. This legislation seeks to support agricultural contracts and ensure continuous assistance to farms during financially challenging times.

The introduction of this bill responds to growing concerns among farmers facing delayed agreements and potential office closures which could exacerbate the issues they face in managing their operations. Farmers rely heavily on contracts and support services provided by the Department of Agriculture, and disruptions can limit their capacity to effectively plan and sustain their businesses. By unfreezing the funding, farmers are expected to receive timely payments, restoring trust in governmental processes.

Under the proposed act, the Secretary of Agriculture is mandated to swiftly resume all outstanding contracts and agreements made prior to the law's enactment. Additionally, it would protect farmers by preventing the cancellation of signed contracts unless there is a clear failure to comply with terms. This stipulation aims to enhance stability and predictability for agricultural stakeholders.

The Honor Farmer Contracts Act also includes provisions to prevent the closure of Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service offices without prior notice to Congress, ensuring that critical local support continues uninterrupted. Maintaining these offices is vital for providing farmers with essential resources and assistance.

This bill reflects a broader commitment to strengthen the agricultural sector, recognizing the vital role farmers play in the economy and food supply chain. As it moves through the legislative process, its provisions aim to alleviate immediate pressures on farmers while laying a foundation for future agricultural support.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2395",40434,"Rep. Clyde Introduces SHORT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-GA, has introduced the “Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today” (SHORT) Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at revising definitions within the National Firearms Act. The bill seeks to remove short-barreled rifles and shotguns from the definition of firearms, thereby easing regulatory burdens for owners of these weapons.

This legislation emerges amidst ongoing debates over gun ownership rights and restrictions. Proponents argue that current laws disproportionately impact responsible gun owners while failing to address illegal firearm use. By redefining what constitutes a firearm, the SHORT Act is intended to simplify legalities surrounding ownership and transfer, improving accessibility for enthusiasts and collectors.

The potential impact of the SHORT Act is multifaceted. Supporters assert that it not only aligns with Second Amendment rights but could also reduce the workload on federal and state law enforcement regarding the registration and transfer of these weapons. Detractors, however, caution that such changes could lead to increased misuse and risks associated with these firearms, particularly in urban environments.

The bill also proposes to destroy existing records of registered short-barreled firearms, which could further benefit gun owners by safeguarding their privacy, but raises concerns about accountability. Many lawmakers are expected to scrutinize these measures during legislative debates, with the implications of privacy versus public safety being a central theme.

Clyde’s bill, which has garnered support from numerous Republican colleagues, is set to be evaluated by the House Committees on Ways and Means and the Judiciary. As discussions unfold, the SHORT Act's future will hinge on bipartisan negotiations over gun regulations, a contentious topic in American politics today.

The introduction of this bill comes amid heightened concerns over foreign interference and the growing complexity of international criminal activities. The DETERRENCE Act responds to increasing incidents of crimes such as kidnapping and violence that are allegedly orchestrated or influenced by foreign actors. By implementing sentencing enhancements of up to 10 years for such offenses, the bill aims to send a strong message against foreign collaboration in domestic crimes. 

Additionally, if the offenses result in personal injury or involve conspiracy, the penalties could further increase, providing law enforcement and judicial systems with more robust tools to tackle such challenges. This legislative move is part of a broader initiative to fortify the nation's legal framework against external threats, emphasizing a proactive stance on national security.

The DETERRENCE Act also addresses specific offenses, such as murder-for-hire and officials' protection, intending to elevate the seriousness with which these crimes are viewed in relation to foreign collusion. Stakeholders in public safety and national security expect that the bill will navigate the legislative process, enhancing the government's capacity to address increasingly sophisticated threats that cross borders.

As the bill is debated, its potential impact on the legal landscape of crime related to foreign influence will be closely monitored, highlighting the continuing importance of a vigilant and responsive legal system in safeguarding U.S. interests.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the STABLE Act of 2025, legislation aimed at establishing regulatory frameworks for payment stablecoins in the United States. This bill seeks to create clear guidelines for issuing, managing, and redeeming stablecoins, ensuring the stability and transparency of these digital assets.

The introduction of the STABLE Act comes amid growing concerns over the unregulated expansion of stablecoins, which have gained popularity as a digital payment method. Proponents argue that establishing a regulatory framework is essential to protect consumers and the financial system from potential risks associated with these digital assets. The act mandates that only authorized issuers may create stablecoins and requires them to maintain reserves equal to their issued coins, enhancing consumer confidence and financial integrity.

By outlining stringent requirements for issuing stablecoins, the STABLE Act aims to prevent fraudulent activities and establish a more reliable marketplace for digital assets. Additionally, the legislation includes provisions for transparency, requiring issuers to disclose their reserve practices and submit regular audits by registered public accounting firms.

The bill also acknowledges the growing necessity for collaboration between federal and state regulators to harmonize oversight of payment stablecoins. This collaborative approach is anticipated to foster innovation while simultaneously safeguarding against potential threats to economic stability.

Recognizing the evolving nature of digital finance, the STABLE Act not only addresses current market concerns but also sets the stage for the future of digital assets within the broader financial landscape. As stablecoins continue to gain traction, this legislation represents a significant step towards comprehensive regulatory oversight. The act is now under review by the House Financial Services Committee, where further discussions and potential amendments will take place.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Patrick Ryan, D-NY, has taken a significant step toward improving logistics efficiency by introducing the Strengthening Supply Chains Through Truck Driver Incentives Act. This proposed legislation aims to establish a refundable tax credit of up to $10,000 for commercial truck drivers, addressing the critical shortage of drivers in the industry.

The bill was introduced in the House on March 26, 2025, and is designed to revitalize the trucking sector, which has faced staffing challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. By incentivizing both seasoned drivers and new recruits, the legislation targets an influx of talent into a vital segment of the supply chain, ultimately enhancing the nation's distribution capabilities.

Under the proposed act, drivers who meet specific criteria, such as logging at least 1,900 hours of driving in a taxable year, would be eligible for the tax credit. This initiative also includes provisions for apprentices, allowing them to count training hours toward the required driving hours. This change could encourage younger individuals to consider careers in trucking, helping to bridge the generational gap in the workforce.

The trucking industry plays a pivotal role in maintaining supply chains, impacting everything from food deliveries to e-commerce logistics. As underscored by recent disruptions in these patterns, a robust driver workforce is essential for economic stability. The Act's financial support for drivers seeks not only to alleviate the current labor shortage but also to retain drivers who might otherwise leave the profession due to financial pressures.

Ryan’s legislation reflects a growing recognition of the challenges faced by essential service workers. By fostering increased participation in the trucking industry through financial incentives, the Strengthening Supply Chains Through Truck Driver Incentives Act aims to secure a more resilient supply chain for the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Rouzer, R-NC, has introduced the Maritime Supply Chain Security Act, which aims to clarify how federal funds for port infrastructure can be utilized. The new legislation specifically permits the replacement of port crane hardware and software sourced from China, seeking to enhance the resilience and security of U.S. maritime operations.

The motivation behind the bill arises from heightened concerns regarding the security risks associated with foreign-made port equipment. As global supply chains have become increasingly strained, the U.S. government is keen on ensuring that its critical infrastructure does not rely on technology that could be compromised by foreign adversaries. This legislation encourages U.S. ports to replace Chinese equipment, a move seen as vital to securing American ports against potential disruptions.

By explicitly allowing federal funds to be used for this purpose, the Maritime Supply Chain Security Act aims to modernize and strengthen the port infrastructure while addressing the ongoing concerns about reliance on foreign technology. The bill also underscores a broader legislative effort to bolster national security in all aspects of supply chain management. 

This proposal is particularly timely, given the ongoing apprehensions about the supply chain and national defense, reflecting a bipartisan recognition of the vulnerabilities presented by foreign dependencies. The bill has been ordered to be reported by voice vote in the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, marking a significant step toward addressing these critical security issues in the maritime sector.

As it progresses through Congress, the Maritime Supply Chain Security Act may serve as a catalyst for future legislation aimed at reinforcing the United States' port infrastructure and overall economic security.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Randall, D-WA, has introduced the Quinault Indian Nation Land Transfer Act aimed at transferring approximately 72 acres of federal land in Washington State to the Quinault Indian Nation. This legislation seeks to enhance the tribe’s ability to manage and benefit from their land while ensuring environmental compliance.

The bill responds to longstanding requests from the Quinault Indian Nation for greater control over traditionally occupied lands. The trust transfer is anticipated to boost the tribe's economic and cultural development. With this land taken into trust, it would become part of the Quinault Indian Reservation and be subject to federal laws and regulations relevant to Indian trust lands.

However, the legislation outlines strict limitations, as the land will be excluded from eligibility for gaming under existing federal regulations. This decision appears to be an effort to preserve the cultural integrity of the Quinault Nation while mitigating concerns regarding the potential proliferation of gaming operations on newly acquired tribal lands.

By facilitating this transfer, the bill aligns with historical agreements between the U.S. government and the Quinault Nation and presents a chance to rectify historical oversights regarding land management and sovereignty. Additionally, the bill stipulates that any hazardous materials found on the land must be disclosed in accordance with federal laws, preventing the tribe from being burdened with unaddressed environmental concerns.

The introduction of the Quinault Indian Nation Land Transfer Act reflects an ongoing effort to strengthen tribal sovereignty and support the development goals of the Quinault Indian Nation. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration. If successful, it could mark a significant step forward in enhancing self-determination for the tribe.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Randall, D-WA, has introduced the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Project Lands Restoration Act, aimed at taking approximately 1,082.63 acres of federal land in Washington into trust for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. This initiative seeks to enhance the tribe’s ability to manage its lands and preserve its cultural heritage while promoting economic development.

The bill was introduced in response to ongoing efforts by the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe to restore land lost over generations and to address historical injustices. By transferring the specified lands to trust, the tribe will gain greater autonomy over natural resources essential for cultural practices, including fishing and gathering. Furthermore, this restoration will aid in the rehabilitation of local ecosystems and support initiatives tied to the Elwha River.

If passed, the act will allow the designated land to be excluded from federal requirements for valuation and appraisal, streamlining the process of land management for the tribe. It is anticipated that the trust status will not only empower the tribe with self-governance but also facilitate the implementation of conservation projects in collaboration with federal and state agencies.

The act emphasizes the importance of protecting treaty rights as stated in the Treaty of Point No Point, ensuring that the new legislation will not infringe upon the existing rights of the tribe. The proposed measure reflects a growing trend among lawmakers to acknowledge and rectify past injustices faced by Indigenous communities, fostering a renewed partnership for future collaboration.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, where it awaits further discussion and potential amendments as supporters advocate for its swift passage.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2387",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces No Harm Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced the No Harm Act, a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at prohibiting federal funding for sex-trait altering treatments for minors. The bill seeks to curtail federal financial backing for procedures or therapies deemed to alter a minor's biological sex, thus addressing growing concerns around medical practices related to gender transition in youth.

The introduction of this bill aligns with a rising national discourse on the rights of minors regarding gender identity and medical treatments. Many advocates assert that minors should not undergo irreversible medical procedures without full understanding and oversight. By restricting federal funding for such treatments, the No Harm Act aims to ensure that decision-making remains predominantly in the hands of parents and guardians, thereby emphasizing parental consent as a legal requirement.

This legislation is expected to have significant implications for healthcare providers and institutions, potentially affecting their funding and practices. Hospitals, clinics, and medical centers that provide such treatments to minors may become ineligible for federal support if they violate the stipulations outlined in this bill. In doing so, the bill reflects broader societal debates about medical ethics, children's rights, and parental authority.

Critics of the bill fear it could infringe on access to necessary medical care for vulnerable populations, while supporters argue it is crucial for protecting minors from making life-altering choices at a young age. The No Harm Act's implications extend beyond healthcare; it poses questions about the future roles of healthcare providers, parents, and policymakers in protecting minors while respecting individual rights. As the legislation moves through committee, the unfolding discussions will likely shape future health policy regarding minors and gender transition treatments in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Ogles, R-TN, has introduced the Make Education Great Again Act, a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing educational outcomes by prioritizing parental and local control over education policy. This bill intends to empower parents with more choices in their children’s education, including public, charter, private, and homeschooling options.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to concerns around federal overreach in education, which critics argue has resulted in decreased local authority and hindered academic improvement. By returning educational decision-making power to parents and local communities, the act seeks to foster greater accountability and innovation in educational practices. The legislation emphasizes the belief that effective education is best achieved through trust in local decision-makers rather than federal bureaucracies.

If enacted, the Make Education Great Again Act could significantly impact how federal education funds are utilized, ensuring that they are directed toward supporting parents and communities. The bill also mandates the Secretary of Education to take steps that align federal funding with local needs, promoting options such as education savings accounts and charter schools. 

Notably, the act includes provisions to reduce federal administrative burdens on state education agencies, enhancing transparency regarding educational content, policies, and funding. By establishing these guidelines, the bill aims to ensure that parents are informed and engaged in their children's educational choices.

As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Education and Workforce, it represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate about the role of federal versus local control in education, reflecting broader national sentiments surrounding educational reform.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-CA, has introduced the Creating Resources for Every American To Experiment with Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (CREATE AI Act), aiming to establish a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) to democratize access to AI resources. This initiative seeks to provide researchers and students, particularly those in underrepresented groups, with greater access to crucial data sets and computational resources needed for AI development.

The impetus behind the CREATE AI Act stems from the growing recognition that artificial intelligence research is predominantly conducted by large tech companies, which limits diversity and innovation in the field. By creating the NAIRR, the bill aims to level the playing field, ensuring that a wider pool of talent can contribute to and benefit from AI advancements.

The proposed legislation outlines a governance structure for the NAIRR, which includes a steering subcommittee tasked with managing resources effectively and developing funding opportunities. The bill underscores the need to engage diverse talent in AI research. It emphasizes that minority researchers and smaller institutions often lack access to the advanced resources required for meaningful contributions to AI innovation.

Moreover, the CREATE AI Act aims to enhance the U.S.'s leadership in AI by providing robust support for the academic and research communities. By redefining AI development as a national priority, the legislation hopes to address potential ethical concerns while advancing capabilities in AI technology through accessible testing and benchmarking solutions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zachary Nunn, R-IA, has introduced the Financial Technology Protection Act, aimed at combating terrorism and illicit financing through the establishment of an Independent Financial Technology Working Group. This initiative seeks to bolster the U.S. government’s response to the increasing use of digital assets in illegal activities.

The Financial Technology Protection Act is a strategic move in response to the rising concerns about how emerging technologies, particularly those related to digital currencies and financial technologies, can be exploited for illicit purposes. This bill proposes the creation of a working group that will include representatives from multiple federal agencies including the Department of Treasury, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. The group's mission will be to conduct comprehensive research on the use of digital assets in terrorist financing and to develop legislative and regulatory proposals that enhance anti-money laundering efforts.

The potential impact of the Financial Technology Protection Act is significant. By targeting the intersection of financial technology and illicit activity, the legislation aims to protect both national security and the integrity of the financial system. As digital assets continue to gain traction, establishing a clear regulatory framework could help prevent rogue actors from exploiting these technologies to evade sanctions or finance terrorism.

Emerging technologies are already reshaping the financial landscape, and this bill positions the U.S. to lead in ensuring that such advancements are not misused. The working group is expected to submit regular reports on its findings, promoting transparency while formulating effective countermeasures against the illicit use of financial technology.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joe Neguse, D-CO, has introduced the Protecting Kids from Fentanyl Act, aimed at combatting the rising crisis of opioid misuse among adolescents. This legislation seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act by enabling schools to utilize Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants for purchasing life-saving opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, and offering necessary training for educators and students.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst alarming statistics on adolescent opioid misuse. Reports indicate a sharp increase in fentanyl-related overdoses among teenagers, highlighting an urgent need for proactive measures. The Protecting Kids from Fentanyl Act is designed to equip schools with the tools necessary to respond to this crisis effectively.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gregory F. Murphy, R-NC, has introduced the First Responders Retirement Parity Act, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to expand pension plan eligibility for firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics. This move seeks to provide these essential personnel with equitable retirement benefits similar to those of other governmental employees.

The initiative comes in light of ongoing discussions about the need for improved financial security for first responders, who often face unique challenges and risks in their professions. Currently, many public safety agencies struggle to establish suitable pension plans due to regulatory limitations. This bill aims to rectify these challenges by allowing participation in governmental pension plans for emergency service personnel, thereby enhancing retention and recruitment efforts in these critical fields.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it seeks to provide vital support to individuals who dedicate their careers to public safety. By expanding pension options, the bill may help alleviate financial stress for many first responders, consequently improving their overall job satisfaction and quality of life.

Historically, first responders have faced hurdles in accessing the same retirement benefits available to other public service employees. By introducing this bill, Rep. Murphy highlights the importance of recognizing the value that these individuals bring to their communities. This legislative effort aligns with broader initiatives aimed at enhancing the welfare of first responders and acknowledging their sacrifices.

This bill will be reviewed by the House Committees on Education and Workforce, as well as Ways and Means, where it will be examined further before any potential vote.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joseph Morelle, D-NY, has introduced the SCREENS for Cancer Act, aiming to reauthorize and enhance the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This legislation targets fiscal years 2026 through 2030 and seeks to ensure equitable cancer screening services to underserved communities across the United States.

The SCREENS for Cancer Act is introduced against a backdrop of alarming statistics: over 319,750 new invasive breast cancer cases are projected in 2025, alongside nearly 43,000 related deaths. Furthermore, it's estimated that about 13,360 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will arise, resulting in around 4,320 deaths. Recognizing these critical issues, the bill aims to strengthen existing screening initiatives that have been instrumental in diagnosing thousands of cases at earlier and more treatable stages.

Additionally, this measure emphasizes expanding outreach to women who may be geographically or culturally isolated, thereby increasing access to essential screenings. Since its inception in 1991, more than 6.4 million individuals have utilized this program, evidencing its profound impact on public health.

The proposed legislation also seeks to enhance follow-up services, improve navigation of healthcare services, and foster access to comprehensive screening solutions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Barry Moore, R-AL, has introduced the Farmers’ Market Expansion Act, aiming to enhance the Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program. This legislation seeks to include tree nuts, both shelled and unshelled, in the program, which provides access to fresh local produce for seniors.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when there is significant focus on improving the nutritional options available to senior citizens. The aim is to provide healthier choices, thereby addressing nutritional disparities faced by this demographic, especially those with limited access to fresh, nutritious food. By incorporating tree nuts, which are known for their health benefits, the program will broaden its offerings, encouraging seniors to incorporate more nutrient-dense foods into their diets.

The potential impact of this bill is wide-reaching. Allowing tree nuts into the program not only promotes healthier eating habits among seniors but also supports local farmers who cultivate these products. With many farmers' markets across the country already providing a variety of goods, the addition of tree nuts can help stimulate local agriculture and bolster food security in communities.

The Farmers’ Market Expansion Act is framed within existing legislation, specifically amending the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. This context highlights the bill's foundation in an established legislative framework while addressing modern needs. The House Agriculture Committee is now responsible for reviewing the bill, where its provisions will be evaluated for potential adoption. 

The move is expected to resonate well with advocates for elder nutritional health, agricultural sustainability, and local food systems, potentially paving the way for similar initiatives in the future.

The bill seeks to amend the United States Code by formally defining terms such as boy, girl, man, woman, and sex based on biological characteristics.

The bill was introduced amid ongoing debates about gender identity in legislation, reflecting a growing trend among conservative lawmakers to assert biological definitions as the basis for legal classifications. Proponents argue that such clarity is necessary to ensure that laws and regulations consistently align with biological sex, thereby removing ambiguity surrounding gender identity in federal policy.

If passed, this legislation could significantly impact various governmental functions, including access to sex-segregated services, data collection, and legal definitions associated with family roles such as mother and father.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, recently introduced the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians Land Transfer Act, aimed at transferring federal land in California into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians. The bill seeks to enhance the tribe's sovereignty by revoking prior public land orders and facilitating the trust status of approximately 204 acres.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing efforts to rectify historical injustices faced by Native American tribes in California and across the nation. Currently, federal restrictions hinder tribes from fully utilizing their lands, impacting their economic and cultural development. By facilitating this land transfer, the bill aligns with broader movements to empower Indigenous communities through greater land management autonomy.

If passed, this legislation is expected to have significant repercussions for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians. Gaining trust status over these lands would provide the tribe with access to federal resources and aid in promoting economic development initiatives. However, the bill explicitly prohibits the use of these lands for class II or class III gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act—a stipulation aimed at addressing community concerns around gaming proliferation.

This initiative is part of a larger trend in Congress to support Indigenous rights and land reclamation efforts. As tribal nations continue to advocate for their sovereignty and self-determination, the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians Land Transfer Act serves as a critical step towards restoring their connection to the land.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration, and its passage could signify a meaningful advancement in the recognition of Native American land rights.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-KY, has introduced the Board of Veterans’ Appeals Attorney Retention and Backlog Reduction Act, aimed at reforming the pay structure of attorneys working at the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BVA). The legislation intends to enhance recruitment and retention efforts while improving the quality and speed of claims processing for veterans.

The bill is a response to growing concerns regarding the backlog of veterans' claims and the need for qualified legal professionals to handle these critical cases. As the demand for veterans’ benefits continues to rise, the BVA has struggled to keep pace, leading to significant delays in decision-making and increased frustration among veterans seeking timely assistance.

One major component of McGarvey's proposed legislation is the enhancement of attorney salaries within the BVA, which is expected to attract skilled legal professionals to fill existing vacancies. By implementing these changes, the hope is that a better-funded legal team can increase overall decision quality and expedite the claims process, ultimately benefiting the veterans who rely on these services.

Currently, attorneys employed by the BVA face substantial challenges, including high caseloads and administrative burdens, which contribute to attrition. Improving their compensation is seen as a vital step to ensure that dedicated professionals remain in their positions, leading to improved outcomes for veterans.

The introduction of this bill is a significant move toward addressing systemic issues within the process of veterans’ claims adjudication. As the legislative process moves forward, the bill has been referred to the Veterans' Affairs Committee for further consideration, marking an essential step in the ongoing effort to enhance services for America’s veterans.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mary Miller, R-IL, has introduced the Ensuring Access to Affordable and Quality Home Care for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act, aimed at preserving vital labor exemptions for companionship and live-in domestic services under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. This legislative move seeks to optimize home care services by ensuring that these essential workers are compensated in a manner that allows for ongoing support for seniors and individuals with disabilities.

The primary motivation behind this bill lies in addressing the increasing need for affordable home care amid a growing aging population. As many families struggle to provide care for their loved ones, ensuring that non-medical home caregiving remains accessible is crucial. The proposed bill strives to affirm the classification of home care workers under specific exemptions, allowing them to continue to serve without the burden of minimum wage and overtime pay regulations that could threaten their employment viability.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it could amplify the availability of caregiving services. By targeting the companionship services exemption, which encompasses tasks such as meal preparation and medication reminders, the bill aims to create an easier pathway for families to secure quality in-home care without exorbitant costs. Moreover, the legislation proposes that these workers can engage in up to 20% of their time for general household work, thus broadening their functional roles within caregiving settings.

In the context of rising demand for home health assistance, Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Moolenaar, R-MI, has introduced the Adams Memorial-Great American Heroes Act, aimed at reauthorizing the Adams Memorial Commission and extending the duration of its activities through 2032. This legislation also seeks to provide a $50 million appropriation for the commission's initiatives, enhancing efforts to commemorate American heroes.

The bill is a response to ongoing national discussions about recognizing and honoring those who have significantly contributed to the United States. By extending the Adams Memorial Commission's authority, the legislation ensures that efforts to create a lasting tribute to these individuals can continue without interruption. The updated funding structure outlined in the bill requires a one-to-one match from non-federal contributions, promoting community involvement and supporting local fundraising initiatives.

The commission's mandate includes not only funding for the memorial but also compliance with standards for commemorative works. The legislation aims to reflect a broader commitment to cultural heritage and historical remembrance while keeping administrative costs limited—capping them at no more than 4% of the allocated federal funds. This reflects a desire for accountability and efficient use of public resources.

Currently, the memorial is envisioned to be located within designated areas as specified in the bill, allowing for community engagement and public appreciation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-FL, has introduced the FEMA Independence Act, a bill aimed at establishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an independent cabinet-level agency. This key initiative seeks to enhance FEMA's capabilities in emergency management by giving it greater autonomy and direct oversight from the President.

The bill responds to long-standing concerns regarding FEMA's operational effectiveness, particularly following major disasters that exposed deficiencies in coordinated responses. By separating FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security, advocates believe the agency can become more agile and responsive, enabling it to better protect communities from both natural and man-made disasters.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joe Wilson, R-SC, has introduced the Pakistan Democracy Act to impose sanctions on foreign individuals involved in the persecution of political opponents in Pakistan, particularly targeting actions against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The bill aims to underscore the United States' commitment to restoring democracy in Pakistan.

The legislation was prompted by rising concerns over the political climate in Pakistan, particularly the military's role in undermining democratic processes. Rep. Wilson asserted the necessity of supporting democratic governance, human rights, and the rule of law in Pakistan, emphasizing the significance of free and fair elections. 

Should the bill pass, it would require the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to impose sanctions within 180 days on individuals, including military officials, known for their involvement in the wrongful imprisonment of political detainees.

Paul Gosar, R-AZ, has introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act, a legislation aimed at amending the Immigration and Nationality Act by eliminating the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which currently allows international students to work in the United States post-graduation.

The introduction of this bill is prompted by ongoing debates over job opportunities for American workers versus international students. Proponents argue that OPT contributes to job scarcity for skilled American graduates by allowing foreign students to fill positions in competitive fields. This legislative move reflects a growing concern among some lawmakers regarding the impact of foreign workers on domestic employment.

By terminating the OPT program, the bill seeks to ensure that high-skilled jobs remain available predominantly for U.S. citizens and permanent residents.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2322",40434,"Rep. Feenstra Introduces FRIDGE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-IA, has introduced the “Fortifying Refrigeration Infrastructure and Developing Global Exports Act of 2025,” known as the FRIDGE Act. This proposed legislation aims to enhance infrastructure reliability for U.S. agricultural exports in foreign markets, focusing particularly on refrigeration systems that support the transport of perishable goods.

The FRIDGE Act responds to significant challenges facing U.S. agricultural exports, notably the inadequate infrastructure in developing countries that limits market access and leads to substantial food loss. Acknowledging that billions of pounds of food products and millions of dollars in exports are lost annually due to poor cold chain logistics, the bill aims to encourage improved infrastructure capabilities to bolster global trade.

Specifically, the legislation proposes that the Secretary of Agriculture enter contracts with eligible trade organizations to provide technical assistance, including needs assessments and training. This assistance will focus on enhancing cold chain capacities and port improvements, essential for safeguarding U.S. agricultural commodities from damage due to infrastructural failures. The bill authorizes $1 million in annual funding for five fiscal years, from 2026 to 2030, for these initiatives.

By fortifying refrigeration and supply chain systems, the FRIDGE Act seeks to not only prevent waste and loss but also improve nutrition in importing countries. The introduction of this act is timely as U.S. agricultural producers continue to navigate competitiveness in a global market increasingly challenged by infrastructural deficiencies abroad. The bipartisan support it may garner reflects a shared understanding of the necessity for sustainable agricultural growth, both domestically and internationally.

The bill (H.R. 2322) introduced on 03/25/2025 has 4 co-sponsors: Rep. Mann, Tracey [R-KS-1]...03/25/2025; Rep. Costa, Jim [D-CA-21]...03/25/2025; Rep. Carbajal, Salud O. [D-CA-24]...03/25/2025; Rep. Davis, Donald G. [D-NC-1]...04/01/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-TX, has introduced the Big Bend National Park Boundary Adjustment Act, aiming to enhance the national park by adjusting its boundary to include approximately 6,100 acres of land. This legislative move seeks to protect additional natural resources and provide an opportunity for expanded recreational activities within the park.

The proposal responds to growing concerns about environmental preservation and the need for greater access to recreational spaces in Texas. By incorporating new land into Big Bend National Park, which currently boasts stunning landscapes and diverse wildlife, the bill aims to enhance the park's ecological reserve while boosting tourism in the region. The inclusion of additional land is projected to significantly increase public access to the park while promoting conservation efforts.

Currently, Big Bend National Park spans over 800,000 acres in the remote Chihuahuan Desert, drawing visitors interested in hiking, wildlife observation, and star-gazing. The proposed boundary adjustment comes after extensive consultations and discussions with local stakeholders and conservation groups, emphasizing the community’s support for preserving the park’s natural beauty.

Additionally, the bill specifies that land acquisition may occur through donation or exchange, with no use of eminent domain, ensuring that the process remains respectful to current landowners. This aspect is crucial as it aims to foster a collaborative approach to land management, valuing both conservation and community interests.

As the House Committee on Natural Resources considers the bill, it is expected to ignite discussions around national park enhancements amidst a broader conversation on environmental stewardship and sustainable tourism. If passed, this legislation would mark a significant step forward for the stewardship of Texas's natural landscapes.

The bill (H.R. 2323) introduced on 03/25/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Veasey, Marc A. [D-TX-33]...04/07/2025; Rep. Castro, Joaquin [D-TX-20]...04/07/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-PA, has introduced the Unity through Service Act, aimed at establishing an Interagency Council on Service to enhance opportunities for military, national, and public service across the United States. The bill proposes a coordinated effort to promote civic engagement and responsible service among American citizens, offering pathways that encourage participation in various service initiatives.

The Unity through Service Act is introduced against a backdrop of declining volunteerism and participation in public service roles. By creating a council that brings together representatives from key federal agencies, the bill seeks to streamline recruitment efforts and foster a sense of community and civic duty. The council would work directly with agencies such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and the Corporation for National and Community Service to devise comprehensive strategies for outreach and recruitment.

The potential impact of this initiative is significant, as it addresses both national security needs and social cohesion. The bill emphasizes the importance of integrating military service with national service programs, potentially increasing overall participation and strengthening both sectors. In recognizing the value of service to society, the legislation aims to create a culture of support and recognition for those who dedicate their time to public welfare.

In addition to the formation of the council, the legislation includes provisions for joint market research efforts to enhance recruitment strategies and improve public service opportunities for veterans transitioning to civilian life. By mandating regular reporting on the effectiveness of recruitment and retention initiatives, the Unity through Service Act sets a framework for ongoing assessment and improvement in service participation within diverse demographic groups. With its broad support, this bill could redefine how Americans engage with their communities and their government through service.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2325",40434,"Rep. Huizenga Introduces CEMAC Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-MI, has introduced the Central African Exploitation and Manipulation of American Companies Act, commonly referred to as the CEMAC Act. This legislation seeks to withhold U.S. support for any actions related to the Central African Economic Monetary Community (CEMAC) within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) until a clear determination of its member states' foreign exchange reserves is made.

The CEMAC Act comes in response to controversial regulations proposed by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) that mandate oil and gas companies to repatriate funds for site rehabilitation. Rep. Huizenga expressed concerns that this regulation will negatively impact investment and foreign exchanges in the region, as it poses significant risks for international oil companies operating in CEMAC. The bill’s proponents argue that BEAC's arbitrary deadlines for compliance could further exacerbate the already declining confidence of investors in Central Africa’s oil and gas sector.

The legislation outlines that the U.S. will not approve any IMF assistance to CEMAC member states unless the IMF clarifies that funds for site rehabilitation cannot be counted as eligible for foreign exchange reserves. This clarification is viewed as crucial for maintaining transparency and appropriate financial policy decisions in the member states. By imposing restrictions, the bill aims to protect American economic interests and ensure that U.S. investments are not compromised by unclear regulations.

With ongoing discussions about investment in the oil and gas sector, and an estimated loss of $86 billion in government revenue due to the regulations, the CEMAC Act represents a significant effort by U.S. lawmakers to hold foreign governments accountable and safeguard American economic interests abroad. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further review.

The bill (H.R. 2325) introduced on 03/25/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Meuser, Daniel [R-PA-9]...03/25/2025; Rep. James, John [R-MI-10]...04/01/2025.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2326",40434,"Rep. Jackson Introduces Dietary Guidelines Reform Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-TX, has introduced the Dietary Guidelines Reform Act of 2025, a legislative effort aimed at revising and improving the dietary guidelines provided to the American public. The bill seeks to amend the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 to ensure that dietary guidelines are established every ten years, rather than five, indicating a shift towards a more scientifically rigorous approach.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing concerns regarding the effectiveness and relevance of current dietary guidelines. Advocates argue that the existing protocols for updating these guidelines have not kept pace with advances in nutritional science. By requiring an Independent Advisory Board of nutrition experts, the bill aims to ensure that recommendations are based on the latest scientific evidence and are relevant to American dietary needs.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it aims to address public health issues related to nutrition and chronic diseases by providing more accessible and evidence-based dietary recommendations. It specifies that the dietary guidelines must consider evidence-based reviews and prioritize nutritional adequacy for diverse populations.

Furthermore, the bill mandates transparency in potential conflicts of interest for those involved in the advisory processes, fostering public trust in the guidelines issued by the government. Coupled with a proposed funding increase, the act represents a proactive step towards enhancing public health initiatives across the nation.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Agriculture for further examination, its proponents stress the urgency of making dietary guidelines more scientifically robust and accessible, which they believe will contribute to improved health outcomes for Americans nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John James, R-MI, has introduced the Soo Locks Security and Economic Reporting Act, aiming to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the security measures surrounding the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This legislation seeks to identify potential vulnerabilities in the locks, evaluate their significance to national supply chains, and determine the economic consequences should a malfunction occur.

The Soo Locks play a crucial role in the transportation of goods, linking Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes. Given their importance, the bill addresses growing concerns about security risks that could disrupt trade and logistics. Rep. James emphasized the urgency of understanding both the infrastructure's weaknesses and the wider implications for local and national economies.

The proposed legislation mandates a detailed report from the Secretary of Transportation, who will collaborate with the Coast Guard and the Department of Defense. This report is to be submitted within one year of the bill's enactment, covering critical areas such as existing security deficiencies, potential threats, and the impacts on supply chains stemming from any disruptions. Moreover, it will include recommended actions and associated cost estimates to enhance the locks' security and minimize risks to commerce.

As global trade dynamics evolve and incidents of infrastructure failures persist, this initiative aims to fortify a vital transportation artery. Advocates are hopeful that prompt action will prevent future economic setbacks and ensure the Soo Locks continue to operate securely and efficiently. The proposed bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2329",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Trent Kelly, R-MS, has introduced the Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act, a legislative measure aimed at extending nondiscriminatory treatment to products from Uzbekistan. This bill seeks to enhance trade relations between the United States and Uzbekistan by facilitating a more favorable trading environment for Uzbek goods.

The Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act addresses existing trade barriers by proposing the termination of certain provisions under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 that currently apply to Uzbekistan. This amendment would allow the President to proclaim the extension of normal trade relations to Uzbekistan, effectively promoting economic collaboration. By supporting Uzbek goods in the U.S. market, the bill aims to foster economic growth in both countries.

This initiative emerges in the context of Uzbekistan's efforts to modernize its economy and integrate more fully into the global marketplace. Uzbekistan has been working towards joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), a move that would further facilitate international trade and economic interactions. The legislation underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting Uzbekistan's transitions, potentially generating significant economic opportunities.

The potential impact of the Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act is manifold. It aligns with broader U.S. strategic interests in Central Asia, enhancing political ties and countering regional influences while promoting American businesses' access to new markets. Furthermore, the passage of this bill could stimulate job creation and investment opportunities within the U.S. by expanding trade volume with Uzbekistan.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it will be pivotal to monitor discussions in the House Ways and Means Committee, which will evaluate the proposal before any further action is taken. If successful, this legislation may mark a significant step towards strengthening U.S.-Uzbekistan trade relations.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2330",40434,"Rep. Kiggans Introduces Virginia Beach Heroes Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, R-VA, has introduced the Virginia Beach Heroes Act, a crucial piece of legislation aimed at providing immediate tax relief to families of two law enforcement officers slain on February 22, 2025. The bill is designed to enhance the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions directed towards the families of the fallen officers.

The tragic events in Virginia Beach prompted this legislative response as communities rally to support those affected by the loss. By accelerating these tax benefits, the bill seeks to encourage broader charitable giving and expedite financial relief for mourning families during an unthinkable time. The proposed Act aims to stipulate that contributions made to assist the families will retain their status as charitable donations, ensuring donors receive appropriate tax deductions.

If enacted, the law would clarify that contributions meant solely for the benefit of the officers' families will not be disqualified under IRS regulations. This provision addresses common concerns donors may have about the eligibility of such targeted contributions. Additionally, payments made by charitable organizations to the spouses or dependents of the victims will be treated favorably, maintaining tax-exempt status for these payments, as long as they follow a fair formula.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means, it garners bipartisan support, with co-sponsors expressing a commitment to supporting law enforcement and their families. The swift introduction of the Virginia Beach Heroes Act underscores the community's unity and recognition of the sacrifices made by those who serve in law enforcement, simultaneously establishing important tax relief mechanisms to encourage charitable contributions at a critical time.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-GA, has introduced the Transparency in CFPB Cost-Benefit Analysis Act aimed at enhancing the rulemaking requirements for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB). This legislation seeks to require the Bureau to provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis for proposed regulations, promoting greater transparency and accountability in the regulatory process.

The need for this bill arises from concerns about the CFPB's regulatory approach, which critics argue may lack sufficient scrutiny regarding its impact on consumers and businesses. By mandating a thorough examination of costs and benefits, the bill endeavors to reduce the burden on small businesses and ensure that regulations are justified. House proponents argue that more rigorous cost assessments could lead to better-informed policy decisions that consider the economic effects on various stakeholders.

Among the proposed requirements are mandatory disclosures regarding the necessity of each regulation, an evaluation of its potential duplication with existing regulations, and a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the economic impact. This would include the identification of alternatives and an assessment of whether small businesses would disproportionately shoulder any regulatory costs.

The introduction of this bill could have significant implications for the CFPB’s operations, as it may restrict the Bureau's ability to implement regulations without comprehensive evidence supporting their necessity and projected effects. Should this act pass, it would represent a shift towards more stringent oversight of government agencies, aiming to foster a regulatory environment that prioritizes economic vitality and efficiency.

Overall, the Transparency in CFPB Cost-Benefit Analysis Act reflects ongoing tensions within the legislative agenda regarding consumer protection and business regulation, highlighting the fine balance lawmakers must maintain when crafting policies that affect the financial sector.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tracey Mann, R-KS, has introduced the SHARE Act, a bill aimed at improving the administration of occupational licensing by authorizing the use of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history record information. This legislation seeks to ease the interstate compact processes for professionals by ensuring that states can access necessary criminal background checks efficiently.

The SHARE Act is designed to address the challenges faced by professionals seeking licenses in states apart from their residence. Currently, many employees encounter extensive delays in acquiring the necessary credentials due to cumbersome licensing processes. By allowing state licensing authorities to request and utilize FBI criminal history data, the bill aims to streamline the verification process for applicants and enhance public safety.

The initiative emerges from growing bipartisan consensus on the need for regulatory reforms to facilitate job mobility while maintaining stringent standards for public safety. As more states enter into interstate compacts, which are agreements for cooperation in regulating professions across state lines, the efficient sharing of criminal history data has become increasingly critical. 
  
The potential impacts of the SHARE Act are significant, as it could accelerate the licensing process for countless workers in various professions. This could ultimately lead to an expanded workforce, especially in sectors like healthcare and construction, where the need for skilled professionals is urgent. Additionally, the bill emphasizes that the shared criminal history records will be used solely for licensing purposes, thus protecting applicants’ privacy.

As the SHARE Act progresses through Congress, it will be scrutinized by the House Committees on Education and Workforce and Judiciary before any further legislative action.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Mannion, D-NY, has introduced the Protecting Students with Disabilities Act to safeguard funding for offices within the Department of Education that oversee programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This measure aims to prevent potential cutbacks and ensure that vital educational services for students with disabilities remain intact.

The legislation was prompted by increasing concerns over administrative changes and budget reallocations that could jeopardize the integrity of services designed for students with disabilities. By prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to eliminate or reorganize these critical offices, Mannion's bill seeks to maintain a consistent framework of support for these students.

If enacted, the Protecting Students with Disabilities Act will solidify federal commitment to special education by blocking any efforts to terminate or restructure key administrative roles within the Department of Education. This move is particularly significant as it reinforces the statutory obligations of Congress alongside the intent laid out in IDEA.

The potential impact of this legislation could be substantial, directly influencing how educational resources are allocated to support students with disabilities across the nation. Advocates argue that ensuring the stability of these programs is essential for providing equitable access to education for this vulnerable student population. 

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where it will undergo further discussion and review. As the legislative process unfolds, stakeholders from various educational and advocacy groups are closely monitoring the bill's development, emphasizing its importance for the continued support and empowerment of students with disabilities in educational settings.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian J. Mast, R-FL, has introduced a bill aimed at amending the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to prevent state laws from recognizing squatter's rights on properties owned by members of the uniformed services. This legislation seeks to ensure that military personnel do not lose their property rights while serving their country, thereby safeguarding their investments during deployments or service-related absences.

The impetus for Rep. Mast’s bill stems from increasing concerns about servicemembers returning from military duty to find unauthorized occupants claiming rights over their properties. With many states recognizing squatter’s rights, servicemembers could potentially face significant legal challenges in reclaiming their homes, causing undue stress and financial hardship. By addressing this issue, the bill aims to create a safeguard, reinforcing the rights of those who serve in the military.

If enacted, the legislation will preempt any state laws that establish squatter's rights against properties owned by active-duty servicemembers. This means that states would be prohibited from allowing squatters to acquire partial ownership or rights to these properties simply due to their occupancy during a servicemember's deployment. The broader goal of the bill is to offer peace of mind to servicemembers, ensuring that their homes remain under their control, regardless of their absence due to military duties.

This legislative effort underscores a growing recognition of the unique challenges faced by servicemembers in maintaining property ownership and legal control over their residences. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, advocates believe it could serve as a critical step in reinforcing the protections available to those who dedicate their lives to serving the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-MD, has introduced a bill aimed at posthumously awarding the Medal of Honor to Doris Miller, a Navy serviceman recognized for his valor during World War II. The legislation acknowledges Miller's heroic actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor and seeks to rectify his omission from previous honors.

Miller, who served aboard the USS West Virginia, was among a handful of African American sailors relegated to non-combat roles at the time. His courageous actions on December 7, 1941, included manning an anti-aircraft gun during the attack while assisting his mortally wounded captain. Despite his exemplary bravery, it wasn't until March 1942—following advocacy from the NAACP—that Miller received formal recognition, being awarded the Navy Cross for his efforts.

The introduction of this bill comes against the backdrop of an ongoing effort to acknowledge the contributions of minority servicemen in U.S. military history. While 15 sailors received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Pearl Harbor attack, none were African American. By granting Miller this prestigious recognition, Congress aims to honor his sacrifice and bravery, addressing historical oversights in the U.S. military's recognition of African American soldiers.

If passed, the bill would allow the President to bypass the standard time limitations for awarding medals due to Miller’s extraordinary valor. This marks a significant step toward ensuring that the legacy of Doris Miller is not only remembered but celebrated, further embedding his story in the annals of American valor and sacrifice. The bill has been referred to the House Armed Services Committee for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-MD, has introduced legislation to award Doris Miller a posthumous Congressional Gold Medal, recognizing his remarkable valor during World War II. Miller, an African American sailor aboard the USS West Virginia, displayed extraordinary bravery during the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941.

The bill aims to address the historical oversight of Miller's contributions, as he was initially relegated to non-combat roles due to racial discrimination within the Navy. Despite this, when faced with the enemy on that fateful day, he boldly manned an anti-aircraft gun and assisted wounded comrades, including his ship's captain. His commendable actions led to the Navy awarding him the Navy Cross in 1942, though recognition came late after intervention from the NAACP.

This legislation is not only a gesture of recognition but also seeks to ensure Miller's legacy is preserved within American history. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, symbolizing valor and sacrifice. The bill's passage would also enable the Smithsonian Institution to display the medal, allowing future generations to learn about Miller's significant contributions during a pivotal moment in U.S. history.

Miller continued to serve until his death in action in 1943, and today, this bill stands to honor the sacrifices he made in the Navy. If enacted, it would serve as a poignant reminder of the bravery shown by countless individuals who served, often against the backdrop of systemic inequality. The Doris Miller Congressional Gold Medal Act is currently under review by the House Financial Services and Administration committees, with supporters hopeful for a swift passage.

The bill (H.R. 2336) was introduced on 03/25/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Cory Mills, R-FL, has introduced the PARENT Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act in order to clarify birthright citizenship regulations. The bill specifies that only children born to parents who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents at the time of birth will automatically be granted citizenship.

The introduction of the PARENT Act comes amid ongoing debates concerning immigration and citizenship in the United States. Proponents argue that the bill seeks to solidify and clarify existing laws regarding citizenship for children born in the U.S., addressing concerns about automatic citizenship rights for individuals born to non-citizens. By delineating the criteria more explicitly, the bill aims to deter potential exploitation of birthright citizenship provisions by non-residents. 

This legislation could significantly reshape the understanding and application of birthright citizenship, impacting many families and individuals across the nation. Supporters assert that enacting this bill would ensure that citizenship is granted based on lawful and recognized statuses, thereby reinforcing national immigration policies. However, opponents warn that the bill could create legal uncertainty for many children born to non-citizen parents and potentially lead to increases in stateless individuals.

The PARENT Act underscores the ongoing complexities of immigration reform in Congress, reflecting differing viewpoints on citizenship and national identity. As the bill progresses, it will be scrutinized in the context of broader immigration policy as lawmakers grapple with balancing enforcement, compassion, and the rights of American children. This legislative effort will ultimately be evaluated for its implications on both existing families and the individuals who may seek to enter the U.S. in the future.

The bill (H.R. 2337) introduced on 03/25/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Harris, Andy [R-MD-1]...03/25/2025.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2338",40434,"Rep. Moore Introduces Worker Relief and Credit Reform Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gwen Moore, D-WI, has introduced the Worker Relief and Credit Reform Act of 2025 with the intent to expand and enhance the earned income tax credit (EITC). The bill aims to provide greater financial support for low- and middle-income individuals, particularly students, caregivers, and those facing economic hardship, by adjusting eligibility criteria and increasing credit amounts.

The WRCR Act seeks to address ongoing economic challenges faced by many Americans by broadening eligibility for the EITC. Notably, the bill allows students who qualify for federal Pell Grants, among other criteria, to access the credit. By redefining qualifying students and expanding qualifying dependents, the legislation intends to ensure that more individuals can benefit from this essential tax relief.

In light of rising living costs and stagnant wage growth, the bill aims to mitigate financial strain on families, particularly those with young children or caregivers. Increasing the credit's value, particularly for unmarried individuals with multiple dependents, is designed to provide more robust support during tax filings. It also proposes a system for advance monthly payments, allowing taxpayers to receive funds throughout the year rather than waiting for tax season.

Additionally, the bill outlines initiatives for outreach and education regarding the EITC and its benefits, ensuring that eligible taxpayers are informed and can access credits efficiently. Historical data shows that many eligible individuals do not claim the EITC due to a lack of awareness or understanding of the application process.

The WRCR Act continues to focus on modernizing the tax code to align with the evolving economic landscape and support working families in navigating financial challenges. With bipartisan support expected, the legislation has potential implications for millions impacted by economic hardship across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY, has introduced the Children’s Health Protection Act, aimed at reinforcing the mandate and functions of the Office of Children’s Health Protection within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This legislation seeks to ensure that the unique health needs of children are adequately addressed in federal environmental policies.

The bill responds to growing concerns about the environmental risks that disproportionately affect children, such as air and water pollution and exposure to hazardous chemicals. By maintaining a dedicated office within the EPA, the legislation emphasizes a comprehensive approach to safeguard children's health amidst increasing environmental threats. The reestablished office will be tasked with coordinating federal research, promoting safer chemical management, and enhancing community-based programs that protect young populations.

The act outlines a series of responsibilities for the newly structured office, including assessing environmental health risks, advising on regulations related to children’s health, and increasing environmental health literacy among healthcare providers. The bill also authorizes over $7 million for fiscal year 2026 to ensure that these tasks are adequately funded.

By reestablishing the Office of Children’s Health Protection and its advisory committee, the legislation aims to elevate children's health issues in environmental discussions at the federal level. It responds to feedback from health experts and advocates who argue that children's vulnerability to environmental hazards necessitates clear, focused attention in environmental policy-making.

As legislators consider the new bill, its passage could significantly impact public health and safety standards in environments frequented by children—from schools to parks. The Children’s Health Protection Act is poised to shape future dialogues on public health initiatives and environmental justice for the nation’s younger generations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chris Pappas, D-NH, has introduced the Advancing Enrollment and Reducing Drug Costs Act, aimed at easing healthcare costs for a vulnerable segment of the population. The bill proposes to automatically qualify certain Medicaid beneficiaries for both premium and cost-sharing subsidies under the Medicare Part D program, significantly reducing their out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.

The introduction of this bill addresses the growing concern about prescription drug costs and accessibility. Many Medicaid recipients currently face hurdles when transitioning to Medicare upon turning 65, often incurring high costs that can deter necessary medical care. By allowing these individuals to automatically qualify for subsidies, the legislation intends to streamline their transition and alleviate financial burdens on those with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line.

With rising healthcare costs becoming an increasingly pressing issue, particularly for the elderly, this bill seeks to provide immediate relief to those who depend on Medicaid. Moreover, it addresses broader systemic issues within the healthcare framework that often leave vulnerable groups at risk for financial hardship due to sudden changes in their eligibility status when they age into Medicare.

The Advancing Enrollment and Reducing Drug Costs Act is currently referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce as well as Ways and Means, where it will undergo further evaluation to assess its implications and feasibility. Should the bill gain traction, it could set a precedent for future legislation aimed at improving healthcare access and affordability for low-income populations, marking a progressive step toward enhancing the overall quality of care in the American healthcare system.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2341",40434,"Rep. Rouzer Introduces Duplications of Benefits Victims Relief Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Rouzer, R-NC, has introduced the Duplications of Benefits Victims Relief Act, aimed at amending the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. This legislation seeks to provide flexibility by allowing the President to waive certain prohibitions on duplication of benefits for individuals affected by major disasters or emergencies.

The bill was introduced in response to concerns that existing regulations often hinder timely assistance for disaster victims. Under current law, individuals receiving insurance or state aid may be restricted from obtaining necessary federal assistance. Rouzer's proposed changes intend to alleviate these barriers, enabling quicker support for victims who have suffered losses due to disasters like hurricanes or floods.

If enacted, the act would empower the President to waive restrictions on benefits duplication upon a governor's request. This adjustment would be applicable to any major disaster declared after January 1, 2016. The intended result is to streamline assistance, ensuring those impacted can access multiple resources without penalization for overlapping benefits.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant for disaster recovery efforts. Many survivors currently navigate complex bureaucratic hurdles that delay essential aid. By simplifying the process, the Duplications of Benefits Victims Relief Act aims to offer a more cohesive framework for federal disaster response, which is especially critical in the wake of increasingly severe weather events driven by climate change.

Members of the House from both parties have shown interest in addressing the inefficiencies within disaster relief systems, suggesting a willingness to engage in bipartisan support for the measure. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further consideration, with many advocates hoping for swift action.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Rouzer, R-NC, has introduced the State-Managed Disaster Relief Act aimed at streamlining financial assistance for state and tribal governments following small-scale disasters. This legislation allows these entities to request a one-time lump sum payment equivalent to 80% of estimated damages, simplifying access to funds that can expedite recovery efforts.

The motivation behind the bill stems from the ongoing challenges faced by communities during disaster recovery, particularly after smaller disasters that may not fit into the traditional federal assistance framework. Current processes under the Stafford Act can often delay aid, hampering timely recovery efforts. With the new alternative procedures, state governors and tribal leaders can leverage a more efficient mechanism to access necessary funds when faced with crises that affect local infrastructure and public safety.

If passed, the act could significantly enhance the ability of states and tribes to respond proactively to disasters. It aims to reduce administrative burdens and allow local authorities to allocate funds according to their specific needs without waiting for additional federal evaluations or approvals. This billing approach fosters a more rapid recovery process, enabling resources to flow more freely to areas most impacted by such disasters.

In essence, the State-Managed Disaster Relief Act represents a shift towards localized management of disaster recovery funds, which supporters argue can facilitate more tailored responses to varying local conditions and needs. This legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further review.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-FL, has introduced the John W. Walsh Alpha-1 Home Infusion Act of 2025, a legislative measure aimed at expanding Medicare coverage for treatments related to Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disorder. This bill seeks to provide coverage for augmentation therapy — a critical treatment for individuals suffering from this rare genetic disorder, which can lead to severe lung and liver disease.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing recognition of the need for improved healthcare options for patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disorder. Currently, many affected individuals face barriers in accessing necessary home infusion treatments, including financial constraints and a lack of coverage under existing Medicare provisions. By mandating that Medicare cover such treatments, the bill aims to ease these burdens and improve the quality of life for those affected.

The expected impact of the John W. Walsh Alpha-1 Home Infusion Act extends beyond financial relief. By ensuring treatment options are more accessible, the bill is designed to bolster health outcomes for patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disorder. Enhanced access to augmentation therapy is crucial, as it can significantly slow the progression of lung disease and improve overall respiratory health.

Introduced on March 25, 2025, the bill has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means for further consideration. The proposed changes to Medicare policy will be a significant step in addressing the specific healthcare needs associated with this condition.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-IL, has introduced the Water ISAC Threat Protection Act aimed at enhancing the resilience and preparedness of drinking water and wastewater systems against various threats. This legislative measure seeks to establish a program under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will bolster community water systems and treatment works, facilitating their participation in the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Water ISAC).

The motivation behind the bill arises from growing concerns about vulnerabilities in the nation’s water infrastructure, exacerbated by recent cyber incidents and natural disasters. By promoting a cooperative framework among various stakeholders, the act aims to improve incident data collection and threat analysis. This proactive approach could significantly mitigate risks associated with potential malevolent acts and natural hazards impacting water supplies.

Under the proposed legislation, the EPA will receive authorization to allocate up to $10 million annually in fiscal years 2026 and 2027. These funds are designated for initiatives that support community participation in Water ISAC, offset necessary membership costs, and enhance operational tools for monitoring water sector safety. The goal is to empower local entities to better identify, protect, and respond to emerging threats efficiently.

Schakowsky's introduction of this bill comes in the wake of increasing federal scrutiny on water infrastructure security, particularly after numerous recent events highlighting its fragility. Enhanced coordination between the EPA and local water authorities is expected to lead to improved incident response capabilities, benefiting public health and safety.

With bipartisan support likely, the Water ISAC Threat Protection Act represents a critical step forward in safeguarding America's water resources. The legislation is now set for review by the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Energy and Commerce Committees.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Austin Scott, R-GA, has introduced legislation aimed at designating the Ocmulgee Mounds as a National Park and preserve, which seeks to protect and enhance the cultural and historical significance of this site in Georgia. The bill aims to affirm the mounds as a crucial part of American heritage, expanding its protections under federal law.

The Ocmulgee Mounds, rich in Native American history, particularly from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, have long been recognized for their archaeological and cultural value. By establishing the mounds as a National Park and Preserve, this bill provides a framework for management and conservation, ensuring that future generations can appreciate this significant landmark. The legislation specifically prohibits the use of eminent domain for acquiring additional land, emphasizing voluntary transactions with willing sellers.

The new designation aims to enhance access for visitors and promote education about the site’s historical context, cultural resources, and sacred landscapes. The bill also includes provisions for the establishment of an advisory council consisting of tribal representatives, which ensures that the interests of the Muscogee Nation will be integral in the management and interpretation of the park's resources. 

This initiative comes at a time when there is increasing recognition of the need to preserve Indigenous cultural sites and histories across the nation. As trends show a heightened interest in heritage tourism, the Ocmulgee Mounds National Park could attract more visitors, potentially benefiting the local economy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Sherman, D-CA, has introduced the Accountability for Terrorist Perpetrators of October 7th Act, aimed at imposing stringent sanctions against the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) and related entities. The bill seeks to hold accountable those responsible for the October 7, 2023 terrorist attacks in Israel that resulted in over 1,200 casualties.

The legislation responds to the significant rise in violence from the PRC, a known militant group linked with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. These groups have perpetuated terror against not only Israelis but also American citizens and Palestinians. The bill's introduction is prompted by the need for a robust U.S. response to mounting threats from terrorist networks following the devastating attacks in October, where PRC involvement was notably reported.

This act establishes a framework for the President to impose sanctions against the PRC and any affiliates operating under its influence. Among the proposed sanctions are asset freezes and restrictions on visas for implicated individuals, aiming to disrupt their operations and reduce their ability to carry out future attacks.

The impact of this legislation could extend beyond immediate financial penalties; by naming specific groups and individuals, it seeks to deter further violence and destabilization in the region. The PRC’s history includes high-profile attacks that have endangered both U.S. and Israeli lives, making its regulation crucial to maintaining international security.

As the bill moves to the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees for review, it symbolizes a heightened commitment from U.S. lawmakers to address and counter terrorism. The legislation is crucial in reinforcing U.S. support for Israel amid ongoing conflict and promoting accountability for acts of terror.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2347",40434,"Rep. Smucker Introduces Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-PA, has introduced the Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at alleviating the financial burdens faced by survivors of sexual violence. This bill proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exempting damages awarded in civil cases related to sexual acts and sexual contact from gross income tax.

The introduction of this bill responds to growing concerns about the financial implications faced by survivors who receive compensation through legal settlements. Currently, damages related to personal injuries are often exempt from taxation; however, the law has not explicitly included compensations for sexual violence. By addressing this gap, the Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act aims to ensure that survivors can retain the full financial support awarded to them without facing unexpected tax liabilities.

The potential impact of this legislation could be profound, promoting justice and fairness for survivors. It could empower victims to seek justice through the judicial system without the fear that their compensation will be diminished by taxes, thereby encouraging more individuals to come forward. Moreover, it addresses a broader societal issue of supporting survivors in their recovery journey, emphasizing that the financial repercussions of trauma should not be exacerbated by the tax system.

The bill outlines specific provisions for damages—stating that compensatory awards will not need substantiation through medical records, thus reducing barriers for survivors accessing their entitlements. The proposed changes come alongside a mandate for public awareness campaigns, a collaboration with federal agencies aimed at informing individuals about their rights under this new provision.

As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Ways and Means, many advocates hope it will gain the support necessary to become law, signaling a commitment to justice for survivors of sexual violence.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pete Stauber, R-MN, has introduced the Brake for Kids Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing public safety by addressing the dangers associated with illegally passing stopped school buses. The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to orchestrate a comprehensive national safety messaging campaign to educate the public on this pressing issue.

The Brake for Kids Act responds to a growing concern about school bus safety as data show alarming incidences of illegal passes, endangering the lives of children. This legislation is crafted to raise awareness and reduce these incidents through a multi-faceted communication strategy, leveraging modern advertising channels. The campaign will include television advertisements during peak viewing times, radio spots, and digital outreach via social media, ensuring widespread dissemination of crucial safety information.

The initiative is stimulated by the need to protect schoolchildren as they embark on and conclude their school day. With buses serving as a vital mode of transport for millions of children across the country, the potential for tragic accidents remains high if public ignorance persists. By proactively informing the public, the campaign seeks to cultivate a community ethos of safety and vigilance around school buses.

In addition to securing funding from the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the implementation of this campaign represents a significant commitment from the federal government to prioritize child safety on roadways. The hope is that through concerted public education efforts, communities will respond effectively, leading to fewer violations and increased protection for students.

The Brake for Kids Act is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2350",40434,"Rep. Kustoff Introduces Cellphone Jamming Reform Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Kustoff, R-TN, has introduced the Cellphone Jamming Reform Act of 2025, a legislative proposal aimed at empowering state and federal correctional facilities to utilize jamming equipment to prevent contraband communication. The bill, introduced on March 26, 2025, seeks to reduce illegal communications from within prisons, thereby enhancing security and safety.

This bill emerges against a backdrop of increasing challenges correctional facilities face in managing illegal activities facilitated by contraband cellphones. According to recent reports, the presence of unauthorized phones has resulted in significant concerns, including organized crime and escape planning by inmates. By allowing facilities to operate jamming systems, the legislation aims to create a safer environment for both staff and prisoners.

Under the proposed legislation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would be restricted from prohibiting correctional facilities from deploying jamming technology. The bill specifies that jamming operations would be confined within the facility boundaries, ensuring external communication remains unaffected. Furthermore, it stipulates that state facilities must bear the associated costs of implementing and maintaining these systems while mandating consultations with local law enforcement prior to installation.

The potential impact of the Cellphone Jamming Reform Act is substantial. By cutting off unauthorized communications channels, facilities may significantly reduce the operational capacity of gangs and criminal networks that leverage contraband devices for illicit activities. The introduction of this bill marks a decisive step toward modernizing correctional facility operations, tackling communication-related security issues head-on.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2351",40434,"Rep. McDowell Introduces New Coast Guard Overdose Policy Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Addison McDowell, R-NC, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at addressing the serious issue of drug overdose among individuals in the Coast Guard. The bill directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to update existing policies regarding the use of medication, specifically naloxone, to treat drug overdoses on vessels.

The introduction of this bill comes in the wake of increasing concerns over drug-related incidents among service members, especially concerning opioids such as fentanyl. As drug overdoses have escalated to alarming levels across the country, the Coast Guard's response capabilities are under scrutiny, prompting the need for a policy overhaul. This bill seeks to ensure that naloxone and similar medications are readily available at all Coast Guard installations and operational environments.

Should the bill become law, it would require the Coast Guard to participate in a broader tracking system aimed at monitoring opioid usage and overdoses effectively. This initiative underscores the commitment of the Coast Guard to enhance safety protocols and align their response strategies with contemporary health needs. Moreover, within two years of enactment, the Commandant would be mandated to provide Congress with a comprehensive briefing detailing the use of naloxone, the incidence of opioid overdoses, and measures implemented to mitigate substance abuse within the ranks.

The bill not only emphasizes the necessity of timely medical intervention in the event of overdoses but also reflects a growing recognition of mental health challenges associated with substance abuse in military environments. As lawmakers debate the potential impact and funding for such measures, the health and safety of Coast Guard personnel remain at the forefront of this legislative effort.

The bill (H.R. 2351) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Goldman, Craig [R-TX-12]...03/31/2025; Rep. Gillen, Laura [D-NY-4]...04/02/2025.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2352",40434,"Rep. Lee Introduces Abolish Super PACs Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Summer Lee, D-PA, has introduced a bill aimed at amending the Federal Election Campaign Act to impose reasonable limits on contributions to Super Political Action Committees (PACs). The Abolish Super PACs Act seeks to curtail the rampant influence of money in politics by reinstating contribution limits that have been absent since 2010.

This legislative move responds to growing concerns over the significant power held by Super PACs, which can now collect unlimited sums from individual donors. Critics argue that this situation not only fosters corruption but undermines public trust in the electoral process. With independent expenditures skyrocketing, these political committees have grown increasingly influential in shaping election outcomes, often driven by major donations from a small percentage of contributors. 

In the past election cycles, the share of Super PAC contributions from the top 1% of donors has escalated dramatically, raising alarms about the disproportionate influence on policy and governance on behalf of wealthy interests. Research indicates that, in 2024 alone, Super PACs accounted for more than $4.48 billion in spending on elections. 

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when many Americans perceive large contributions to Super PACs as a means of securing political favors, reinforcing the argument for tighter regulations. The proposal aims to protect the integrity of elections and ensure that broader voices are heard, rather than just affluent interests. 

By establishing contribution limits on entities that engage in independent expenditure activities, the “Abolish Super PACs Act” aspires to restore confidence in the political system and mitigate the risks associated with foreign interference and potential corruption among candidates and donors. The proposed legislation is currently under consideration by the House Administration Committee.

The bill (H.R. 2352) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Khanna, Ro [D-CA-17]...03/26/2025; Rep. McGovern, James P. [D-MA-2]...03/26/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicholas A. Langworthy, R-NY, has introduced the Safer Skies Act of 2025, a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at enhancing aviation security protocols. This bill mandates the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to update security screening requirements for specific air carrier operations, particularly those operating larger aircraft and providing commercial passenger services.

The Safer Skies Act is a response to ongoing concerns about aviation security vulnerabilities and seeks to ensure that all covered air carrier operations comply with stricter security measures. The bill specifically targets operations under parts 135 and 380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, which typically involve carriers that operate aircraft with more than nine passenger seats and provide publicly available flight schedules. By broadening the scope of security requirements, the legislation aims to reduce potential threats to passenger safety.

The proposed changes are designed to be implemented within 360 days following the bill's passage, reflecting an urgent need for reform in air travel security. Such a timeline emphasizes the anticipated risks and the federal government’s commitment to addressing them promptly. The revisions to TSA rules and policies would aim to close existing gaps in security, adapting to modern threats that affect aviation safety.

This legislative effort is bolstered by the support of a bipartisan group of 34 co-sponsors, indicating a collective recognition of the importance of robust security in the aviation sector. As air travel continues to grow in both volume and complexity, the Safer Skies Act of 2025 represents a significant step toward ensuring the safety and security of passengers in the U.S. flight operations.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2354",40434,"Rep. Moore Introduces Restoring Temporary to TANF Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Blake Moore, R-UT, has introduced the Restoring Temporary to TANF Act, aiming to amend the Social Security Act to allocate a significant portion of funds granted to states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs towards essential work-related purposes. This initiative seeks to enhance support for needy families by ensuring that at least 25% of state grant amounts are designated for work supports, education, training, and other core activities.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns about the effectiveness of TANF in promoting self-sufficiency among recipient families. Since its inception, TANF has faced criticism for its limited focus on employment-related services, which are pivotal for long-term economic stability. By emphasizing core work activities, the legislation aims to facilitate better outcomes for families relying on these vital assistance programs.

If passed, the legislation could significantly impact state TANF programs, mandating a shift in how funds are utilized to foster employment opportunities and skill development. This move may help reduce dependency on government aid by effectively equipping recipients with the necessary tools to secure sustainable employment.

The Restoring Temporary to TANF Act could also have broader implications within the context of ongoing discussions about welfare reform in Congress. Advocates argue that the measure encourages a positive framework for engaging families in workforce participation. They contend that investing in educational and vocational training not only helps recipients but also bolsters the economy by increasing the skilled labor force.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it will be closely monitored by various stakeholders, including state governments, advocacy organizations, and policymakers engaged in welfare reform efforts. The Act represents a strategic step toward revitalizing TANF's mission to support low-income families on their path to independence.

The bill (H.R. 2354) was introduced on 03/26/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Blake Moore, R-UT, has introduced the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act aimed at enhancing funding for collegiate housing and infrastructure projects. This legislative effort proposes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code to permit charitable organizations to make grants specifically for the improvement and maintenance of collegiate housing properties, ensuring that these grants will further the educational and residential needs of full-time university students.

The bill comes in response to growing concerns about the quality of student housing and the need for infrastructure that supports a conducive learning environment. As universities grapple with an increasing student population, many institutions are struggling to maintain adequate housing facilities. This proposed legislation seeks to alleviate some of these challenges by providing financial support through grants designated for collegiate housing.

If passed, the act could significantly expand the resources available for constructing, operating, or maintaining collegiate housing, which may include dormitories and other residential facilities tied to educational institutions. These grants are designed to be utilized by organizations that support higher education, allowing them to cater to the unique living conditions suitable for student life.

Background statistics indicate that nearly half of college students face housing insecurity, leading to academic challenges and increased stress. By facilitating funding for more stable and improved housing options, Rep. Moore's initiative could play a pivotal role in enhancing student well-being and success rates in higher education.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means, advocates anticipate robust discussions on its potential impacts and the fiscal ramifications. If successful, the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act could mark a significant step towards better living conditions for students across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Thomas Massie, R-KY, has introduced the Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act, aimed at increasing transparency in election candidacies by requiring candidates to disclose any citizenship outside the United States. This legislation seeks to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, ensuring voters are informed about potential dual loyalties of candidates running for office.

The impetus for this bill stems from ongoing concerns about foreign influence in American politics. Proponents assert that understanding a candidate's citizenship ties is essential for voters to make informed decisions. Massie and his co-sponsors, including Representatives Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, believe that the current lack of such disclosure can lead to questions about loyalty and priorities among elected officials.

If passed, the bill would mandate that all candidates state any foreign citizenship when designating their principal campaign committee. This requirement intends to empower voters with crucial information that could impact their choices at the polls and give rise to a more transparent political landscape.

The potential impact of this legislation could reshape how campaigns are conducted, as candidates may face heightened scrutiny regarding their affiliations and backgrounds. The debate surrounding this issue also reflects the broader national conversation about immigration, citizenship, and the influence of foreign powers in domestic governance.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Administration for review, discussions are expected to intensify regarding its implications for campaign finance and candidate accountability. If enacted, the Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act could set a precedent for increased candidate disclosure requirements, aiming to fortify the integrity of the electoral process moving forward.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Alma S. Adams, D-NC, has introduced the Food Secure Strikers Act aimed at ensuring that workers participating in labor strikes retain their eligibility for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. This legislation comes in response to growing concerns over how striking workers may risk losing crucial support during labor disputes.

The Food Secure Strikers Act seeks to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, addressing a critical gap that currently renders strikers ineligible for SNAP benefits. As labor strikes continue to rise nationwide, the bill is seen as an essential measure to protect the financial wellbeing of workers and their families during periods of wage loss.

Historically, strikers have faced significant hardships due to diminished income, thus relying heavily on federal assistance programs to maintain basic nutrition. By securing targeted support for these individuals, the proposed legislation aims to alleviate food insecurity during strikes, allowing workers to focus on their rights without the added pressure of hunger.

Should the bill succeed, it is expected to impact thousands of families nationwide. Amid a changing labor landscape characterized by increased activism and a push for fair wages, the Food Secure Strikers Act underscores the necessity of legislative frameworks that adapt to the needs of modern labor movements.

In addition to Rep. Adams, the bill has garnered support from several co-sponsors including prominent lawmakers who have expressed a strong commitment to protecting workers' rights. As this legislation progresses through the House Agriculture Committee, stakeholders are optimistic about the potential for enhanced workers' protections in future negotiations and strikes.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Barr, R-KY, has introduced the Ensuring Sound Guidance Act of 2025 (ESG Act), aimed at amending the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to reinforce guidelines regarding the consideration of pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors in investment decisions. The bill, presented on March 26, 2025, seeks significant changes in how investment advisors operate, especially in relation to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

The ESG Act comes in the wake of increasing scrutiny surrounding investment practices that weigh non-pecuniary factors—such as climate change impacts—against traditional financial performance metrics. By clarifying that financial advisors must prioritize pecuniary factors unless otherwise instructed by clients, the bill aims to protect the interests of investors while ensuring advisors maintain rigorous financial accountability.

As the country grapples with evolving investment philosophies, the legislation is expected to have a substantial impact on the financial services industry. It seeks to mandate the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conduct studies on environmental disclosures in the municipal bond market. Crucially, these studies will evaluate the frequency and effectiveness of disclosures related to climate change, potentially leading to reforms that enhance transparency for municipal securities investors.

The bill also addresses potential corruption in municipal securities by requiring a review of existing rules governing solicitation practices. Through these measures, the ESG Act aims to safeguard the interests of both investors and the integrity of municipal financing mechanisms.

As the legislative process unfolds, this bill embodies a pivotal shift towards ensuring that investment practices remain focused on sound financial principles while also addressing the growing demand for responsible investment strategies in an increasingly aware marketplace.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Carey, R-OH, has introduced the Improve Transparency and Stability for Families and Children Act aimed at enhancing fund distribution and management within the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This bill seeks to establish clearer deadlines for when states should obligate and spend TANF funds, enhancing fiscal responsibility in social welfare programs.

The proposed legislation comes in response to rising concerns about the effective use of federal aid to states under the TANF block grant structure. Currently, states have flexibility in how they manage these funds, which can lead to delays or misallocation. By instituting firm deadlines, the bill encourages timely investment in programs that support needy families, ensuring that assistance reaches those in need when it is most crucial.

In addition to setting deadlines for fund allocation, the bill allows states to create rainy day funds, enabling them to reserve a portion of their TANF funds for urgent future needs. This feature aims to promote financial stability while giving states the freedom to navigate economic fluctuations without jeopardizing essential support services.

Supporters of the bill argue that these measures will significantly enhance transparency in how states use federal assistance. By knowing when funds must be obligated and spent, both policymakers and the public can better track the effectiveness of TANF programs in reducing poverty and supporting family stability.

The Improve Transparency and Stability for Families and Children Act was introduced on March 26, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further discussion and potential amendments. If passed, it could greatly impact social welfare strategies and bolster support for American families struggling in uncertain economic conditions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John R. Carter, R-TX, has introduced a bill aimed at permanently extending the exemption from the engine compartment portion of the pre-trip vehicle inspection skills testing requirement for school bus drivers. This legislation seeks to alleviate some of the rigorous testing barriers currently faced by aspiring school bus drivers, simplifying the process to encourage more individuals to enter this critical field.

The initiative comes as many states continue to grapple with a shortage of school bus drivers. By removing the requirement for inspecting the engine compartment, the bill aims to expedite training and licensing for new drivers, thereby addressing staffing shortages that have affected school operations nationwide. The modified requirement is expected to streamline the path to licensure, ultimately facilitating a more efficient recruitment process.

Currently, under federal regulations, school bus drivers must complete a skills test that includes an engine compartment inspection. This component has been identified as a challenging hurdle for many candidates, contributing to potential delays in licensing and onboarding. The proposed bill, which aligns with a temporary exemption previously granted, aims to make this exemption permanent for a six-year period, during which participating states will report on the number of drivers obtaining a commercial driver's license under this change.

Carter’s legislative effort reflects a broader commitment to enhancing the school transportation system's sustainability and reliability. Schools play a vital role in supporting students' educational journeys, and ensuring adequate transportation resources is fundamental for community engagement. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further evaluation and discussion.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Cameras in the Courtroom Act, a significant legislative move aimed at permitting televised coverage of Supreme Court proceedings. This bill was presented to promote transparency and public engagement with the judicial process, reflecting growing calls for greater accessibility in government operations.

This push for cameras in the courtroom comes at a time when public interest in legal proceedings is booming, especially following high-profile Supreme Court cases that have garnered national attention. Supporters argue that live broadcasts of Supreme Court hearings would enhance the public's understanding of judicial deliberations and the workings of the nation's highest court. By allowing cameras, the legislation seeks to demystify judicial proceedings and foster a more informed citizenry.

The proposed bill allows for televised coverage of all open sessions, with exceptions made only if a majority of justices deem it constitutes a violation of due process for involved parties. This provision aims to balance the need for transparency with the protection of individual rights within the judicial system. If passed, it would amend Title 28 of the United States Code, fundamentally altering how the Supreme Court engages with the public.

By advocating for this bill, Rep. Connolly positions himself as a champion of accountability in the judicial system, mirroring movements in various states that have seen implementations of cameras in smaller courts. The Cameras in the Courtroom Act reflects a broader trend towards transparency in government and an effort to modernize judiciary practices that have remained unchanged for decades. The Judiciary Committee will now review the bill as it progresses through the legislative process.

The bill (H.R. 2361) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 4 co-sponsors: Rep. Lynch, Stephen F. [D-MA-8]...03/31/2025; Rep. Tlaib, Rashida [D-MI-12]...03/31/2025; Rep. Lee, Summer L. [D-PA-12]...04/07/2025; Del. Norton, Eleanor Holmes [D-DC-At Large]...04/07/2025.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2362",40434,"Rep. De La Cruz Introduces VA Home Loan Awareness Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-TX, has introduced the VA Home Loan Awareness Act, a legislative measure aimed at increasing awareness of the home loan programs provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This bill seeks to require enterprises to include a specific disclaimer on the Uniform Residential Loan Application, highlighting potential VA loan eligibility for veterans and service members.

The VA Home Loan Awareness Act aims to address the common issue of underutilization of VA loan benefits among eligible individuals. Many veterans remain unaware of their eligibility for these government-backed loans, which can provide substantial financial advantages, including no down payment and competitive interest rates. By mandating a disclaimer on the key application form, the legislation seeks to inform more service members and veterans about the opportunities available to them.

In addition to increasing awareness, the bill instructs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study within 18 months of enactment. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the disclosure and ensure that at least 80% of lenders using the Uniform Residential Loan Application incorporate the new disclaimer into their processes. This oversight aims to maximize the outreach of the program and improve access to benefits for those who have served in the military.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when national conversations around veterans' benefits are increasingly pertinent, as many veterans face financial hardships. With rising housing costs, this bill represents a proactive approach to ensure veterans can leverage valuable financial resources that they earned through their service. The bill has garnered support from a bipartisan group of representatives, indicating broad recognition of the need for increased awareness around VA home loan programs.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Diana DeGette, D-CO, has introduced the DOGE POUND Act of 2025, aiming to tighten access controls to systems that contain individually identifiable health information. This legislation is designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing sensitive health data managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The bill comes in response to increasing concerns over data breaches and the implications they can have on privacy and security. Recent high-profile incidents have raised alarms regarding the potential for misuse of personal health information, prompting lawmakers to ensure stricter regulations surrounding access. The DOGE POUND Act seeks to establish clear criteria outlining who can access HHS health information systems, emphasizing the importance of protecting citizens’ privacy.

Under this proposed law, only those who are HHS employees or contractors with appropriate security clearances and completed training in privacy laws would be allowed access to these systems. The legislation also stipulates penalties for unauthorized access, which could include imprisonment of up to five years. The act further mandates that the Inspector General of HHS conduct investigations and report each instance of unauthorized access, ensuring transparency and accountability.

This bill emphasizes the critical need for safeguarding personal health information in an increasingly digital age, where security measures must evolve to counteract sophisticated cyber threats. Proponents argue that strengthening access controls will not only enhance individual privacy but also restore public trust in the management of health data. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it aims to address these pressing concerns while upholding the integrity of the health information systems that millions rely on daily.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-NC, has introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery Act, aimed at providing crucial support for small businesses impacted by recent natural disasters. The bill seeks to waive the duplication of benefits for certain disaster assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, thereby streamlining financial aid for businesses struggling to recover from major disasters.

The Helene Small Business Recovery Act was developed in response to the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, which have left many small businesses facing financial devastation. Under current law, businesses often struggle to navigate complex regulations that restrict the receipt of multiple forms of assistance for the same disaster, hindering their recovery efforts. This bill aims to simplify this process by allowing the President to waive those restrictions when requested by state governors, facilitating faster access to vital resources.

If enacted, the legislation is expected to bolster economic resilience in communities affected by disasters. By allowing businesses to receive necessary support without the burden of complex eligibility requirements, the bill could help promote quicker recovery and job retention in hard-hit areas. It addresses concerns that bureaucratic obstacles have delayed assistance during critical recovery periods.

The bill specifically targets assistance related to disasters declared under the Stafford Act in 2023 and 2024, highlighting the immediate needs faced by small businesses in the aftermath of these events. With bipartisan backing from other North Carolina representatives, the Helene Small Business Recovery Act aims to provide a more effective safety net for the state’s entrepreneurs and small enterprises. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it seeks to emphasize the need for responsive and responsible disaster recovery efforts across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom Emmer, R-MN, has introduced the Securities Clarity Act, aiming to clarify the definition of securities under U.S. law by excluding investment contract assets from this classification. This legislative move is designed to enhance regulatory transparency and facilitate investment in digital assets.

The Securities Clarity Act of 2025 seeks to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and other related laws, specifying that an investment contract asset is a fungible digital representation of value that can be transferred directly between parties without intermediaries. By offering this definition, the bill aims to ease the uncertainty surrounding the regulation of digital assets, which has become a key issue as cryptocurrencies and related investments continue to grow in popularity.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to calls from industry stakeholders who argue that existing regulations stifle innovation in the digital finance sector. By distinguishing investment contract assets from traditional securities, the Act could foster a more inviting environment for investors and entrepreneurs in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.

Supporters of the legislation contend that it would help clarify the legal status of digital assets, potentially reducing regulatory burdens on companies that seek to create investment products based on blockchain technology. This clarity is seen as crucial for encouraging responsible investment in digital assets while still maintaining consumer protections.

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration. If passed, it could significantly change the landscape for digital asset regulation, aligning U.S. policies more closely with innovations emerging in the financial technology space. As discussions proceed, the potential impact on investors, businesses, and the landscape of digital assets remains a focal point of interest.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2366",40434,"Rep. Escobar Introduces American Families United Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-TX, has introduced the American Families United Act aimed at reforming immigration policies to enhance family unity within the United States. The bill proposes amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, allowing greater discretion for immigration officials to prevent the removal of certain undocumented immigrants who are immediate family members of U.S. citizens.

This legislation was introduced in light of ongoing concerns about the impact of immigration enforcement on family structures, particularly among mixed-status families where some members are U.S. citizens and others are not. The goal is to ensure that the immigration system prioritizes family unity, recognizing that separation can lead to significant emotional and financial hardship. Research indicates that family separation exacerbates mental health issues and disrupts the social fabric of communities, prompting calls for legislative action.

One significant aspect of the American Families United Act is the provision granting the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security the discretion to decline removal proceedings when it poses undue hardship on U.S. citizen family members. This includes the ability to waive certain inadmissibility grounds for eligible family members, thus potentially alleviating fears for many families facing deportation risks.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader shift in discussions around immigration policy, emphasizing compassion and the importance of family. With numerous co-sponsors from both parties, the act seeks to build bipartisan support in the fractured landscape of immigration reform. As the bill progresses through Congress, advocates for family unity hope it will lead to meaningful change for millions of families navigating the complexities of the U.S. immigration system.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2367",40434,"Rep. Houchin Introduces College Employment Accountability Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the College Employment Accountability Act, aiming to reform how universities hire staff concerning undocumented immigrants. The bill seeks to prohibit institutions found employing unauthorized aliens from receiving federal student aid or institutional funding.

The motivation behind this legislation hinges on ongoing concerns about illegal immigration and its impact on federal resources. By mandating educational institutions to verify employment eligibility through the E-Verify program, the bill intends to ensure compliance with immigration laws and protect taxpayer-funded aid from being allocated to institutions that do not uphold these standards. 

If enacted, the law would impose strict penalties on universities not adhering to these hiring regulations, essentially barring them from accessing vital federal funds. This legislative move emphasizes accountability and aims at safeguarding taxpayer dollars, reflecting a growing trend among lawmakers to scrutinize immigration practices within educational institutions.

Contextually, this bill aligns with broader national conversations about border security and educational funding, suggesting legislative action motivated by both fiscal responsibility and immigration enforcement. Compliance with the E-Verify program is positioned as a critical element, showcasing an effort to tie employment practices directly to educational funding eligibility.

As the bill progresses, experts anticipate a heated debate regarding its potential implications on university operations and the broader educational framework. Stakeholders will likely voice concerns over the potential chilling effect on hiring practices and the implications for diversity within the academic workforce. Houchin's bill is currently under review by the House Committees on Education and Workforce and Judiciary, with deliberations expected to deepen as it moves forward in Congress.

The bill (H.R. 2367) was introduced on 03/26/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-MD, has introduced the Raise the Age Act, a legislative measure aimed at increasing the minimum age for purchasing certain firearms from 18 to 21 years. This proposed change targets semiautomatic centerfire rifles and shotguns, with exemptions for active military and full-time law enforcement personnel.

The Raise the Age Act comes in the wake of heightened concerns over gun violence and mass shootings in the United States. Advocates argue that raising the purchasing age could prevent firearms from falling into the hands of individuals who may not be mature enough to handle such powerful weapons responsibly. Research indicates that younger individuals are often involved in gun-related crimes, leading supporters to call for stricter regulations on firearms access.

The legislation proposes amendments to Title 18 of the United States Code, explicitly prohibiting federal firearms licensees from selling or delivering specific rifles and shotguns to anyone under 21. By instituting this age limit, the bill aims to foster a safer environment and reduce the rates of gun-related incidents among youth.

In addition to limiting access, the bill mandates a review of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s operations concerning firearms licensing, ensuring that robust protocols are in place for background checks and information sharing. This oversight could enhance the screening process for firearm purchases, contributing to overall public safety.

The introduction of the Raise the Age Act reflects an ongoing national debate over gun control and the balance between individual rights and community safety. As the House Judiciary Committee reviews this proposal, it will likely spark further discussions on effective solutions to curb gun violence and protect future generations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kelly, R-PA, has introduced the Personal Health Investment Today (PHIT) Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain fitness-related expenses to be considered as medical expenses. This initiative intends to encourage healthier lifestyles and provide financial relief for individuals seeking to engage in physical activities.

The PHIT Act seeks to tackle obesity and related health issues by expanding the definition of qualified medical expenses. Under the proposed legislation, payments for gym memberships, fitness instruction, and certain exercise equipment can be deducted from taxable income, thereby incentivizing Americans to prioritize their health. This legislative effort underscores the growing recognition of the importance of preventive health care measures.

Rep. Kelly’s proposal comes amidst escalating concerns over rising obesity rates and chronic diseases linked to sedentary lifestyles. By allowing individuals to claim fitness expenses as medical deductions, the bill could alleviate the financial burden many face when pursuing healthier habits. The legislation is designed not just for personal fitness enthusiasts but also aims to benefit families, particularly those with limited resources for wellness activities.

The need for such legislation has gained momentum in recent years as policymakers increasingly focus on preventive health strategies. With healthcare costs continuously rising, encouraging fitness could lead to reduced long-term medical expenses for families and the healthcare system overall.

The PHIT Act of 2025 is currently under review by the House Committee on Ways and Means, and its passage could signify a pivotal shift in how Americans approach health and wellness investments. As the conversation around healthcare continues to evolve, this bill represents a proactive strategy to promote comprehensive wellness among citizens.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Young Kim, R-CA, introduced the Taiwan Travel and Tourism Coordination Act to enhance cooperation between the United States and Taiwan in the areas of travel and tourism. This legislation aims to foster closer ties by improving the coordination of tourism-related activities, thus benefiting the economies of both regions.

The bill is designed to create a framework for collaboration between multiple U.S. governmental agencies, including the Departments of Commerce and State. It mandates that the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism engage with Taiwanese authorities to expand tourism efforts. The proposed cooperation includes initiatives such as facilitating industry partnerships, promoting cultural heritage tourism, and ensuring the safety of international visitors.

Amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, the bill reflects U.S. priorities in bolstering economic ties with Taiwan. By addressing tourism, a critical aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations, the act seeks to strengthen mutual economic interests. Enhanced travel between the two nations is anticipated to generate significant economic activity, boosting local businesses involved in hospitality, transportation, and retail sectors.

Moreover, the act outlines a reporting requirement to Congress, ensuring transparency in the implementation of cooperation efforts. These reports will detail the progress and challenges faced, helping to maintain accountability in U.S. engagements with Taiwan.

The introduction of the Taiwan Travel and Tourism Coordination Act signals a strategic initiative to deepen bilateral relations at a crucial time. As Congress considers this legislation, it highlights the importance of tourism as not just an economic driver but also a tool for diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange between the United States and Taiwan.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sam Liccardo, D-CA, has introduced the Scarper Ridge Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act aimed at incorporating the Scarper Ridge property into the existing boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The bill was introduced in the House on March 26, 2025, and has been referred to the Committee on Natural Resources.

This legislative move is motivated by a desire to preserve the unique environmental landscape of Scarper Ridge, known for its diverse flora and fauna. Advocates argue that including this area within the National Recreation Area will enhance public access to natural resources and promote conservation efforts. By protecting Scarper Ridge, the bill seeks to safeguard the area from development pressures, ensuring its ecological integrity for future generations.

The potential impact of this bill extends beyond conservation; it is expected to foster tourism and recreational activities in the region. The incorporation of Scarper Ridge is projected to attract visitors interested in hiking, birdwatching, and enjoying the natural beauty of California's coastal landscapes. This expansion stands to benefit local businesses catering to outdoor enthusiasts, further bolstering the economy.

Historically, the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area have undergone several adjustments to suit environmental and developmental needs. This latest proposal highlights a continued commitment to preserving natural areas amid urban expansion. The bill not only addresses immediate conservation concerns but also reflects broader environmental priorities shared by many California constituents advocating for sustainable land use.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Laura Friedman, D-CA, has introduced the Don’t Penalize Victims Act, aiming to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The legislation seeks to address issues related to the duplication of benefits, ensuring that disaster victims receive the full relief they are entitled to without penalization.

The bill was introduced against the backdrop of widespread concern over federal disaster recovery policies, which have often faced criticism for being overly complex and punitive to those affected by natural disasters. Many disaster survivors have reported challenges in securing the benefits they need, particularly when overlapping assistance from different sources puts them at risk of losing vital financial support.

By revising the regulations that govern benefit duplication, the Don’t Penalize Victims Act intends to streamline the recovery process and provide clearer pathways for victims to access necessary funding. This change could potentially ease the burdens faced by individuals and families struggling to rebuild their lives after disasters, allowing them to navigate the assistance process more effectively.

If enacted, this bill would not only enhance the assistance available to disaster survivors but also serve as a legislative recognition of the complexities involved in disaster response. The act could facilitate quicker and more equitable financial recovery for those impacted by catastrophes such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.

The introduction of this bill underscores a growing recognition among lawmakers of the urgent need to reform disaster relief protocols. As discussions on disaster management continue, advocacy groups have expressed support for measures that prioritize the needs of victims and simplify the relief process to prevent financial hardship. Rep. Friedman and her co-sponsors, representing various constituencies, aim to ensure that those in dire need are no longer penalized during their moment of recovery.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Russell Fry, R-SC, has introduced the Federal Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon Purchase Act, aimed at allowing federal law enforcement officers to purchase their retired service weapons. The proposed bill seeks to establish a formal program under which these officers can buy back firearms from their agencies within six months of retirement.

This legislation comes in response to ongoing discussions regarding the disposal of surplus firearms and the sentiment among many law enforcement personnel favoring the ability to retain their service weapons. Supporters argue that allowing officers to purchase their retired weapons benefits both the officers and the agencies. It provides a sense of continuity and personal connection to the firearms they used during their service, while also simplifying the process of managing retired weapons for federal agencies.

If passed, the bill would require the General Services Administration to implement a program allowing officers to buy their firearms at salvage value, encouraging responsible ownership and use of retired weapons. This provision could help mitigate the potential for retired firearms to end up in the wrong hands, as current disposal methods may not always ensure secure handling.

The bill addresses not only the needs of federal law enforcement officers but also serves as a proactive approach to weapon management within federal agencies. By establishing parameters and clear guidelines, the act aims to ensure that these transactions uphold public safety while honoring the service of law enforcement professionals.

As the legislation moves forward, it will undergo scrutiny in the House Judiciary Committee, which is set to evaluate its implications and consider amendments. This process will help gauge the level of congressional support for the bill, while also assessing its potential impact on law enforcement practices across the nation.

The bill (H.R. 2255) was introduced on 03/21/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Garamendi, D-CA, has introduced the National Rosie the Riveter Day Act, aiming to designate March 21 as a day to honor the contributions of women workers during World War II. This initiative seeks to recognize over six million women who joined the workforce during the war, often taking on challenging and crucial roles in support of the nation's effort.

The bill was introduced to preserve the legacy of the Rosie the Riveters, who left their homes to work in factories, shipyards, and other industries while facing significant societal challenges including discrimination and prejudice. By establishing a designated day of remembrance, the legislation hopes to promote awareness of their struggles and successes, inspiring future generations. The legislation also requests that the President issue an annual proclamation to commemorate this day, calling upon communities to engage in activities that reflect on the vital roles these women played in shaping history.

Designating March 21 as National Rosie the Riveter Day aligns with Women's History Month, serving as an appropriate tribute to working women across the United States. This effort seeks to foster cooperation and recognition among past, present, and future contributors to the workforce. The recognition is particularly poignant considering the recent historical movement towards celebrating women's rights and achievements.

The bill is currently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. Should it pass, it would serve as a formal acknowledgment of the significant yet often overlooked impact women had on the home front during World War II, reasserting the importance of women's contributions to American society and the workforce.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Coin Act, which aims to honor the service and sacrifice of firefighters across the United States. The legislation proposes the minting and issuance of commemorative coins to celebrate the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial, an initiative that is both a tribute and a means of supporting the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.

The introduction of this bill stems from a desire to recognize the vital role firefighters play in protecting communities and the ultimate sacrifices they often make. The proposed coins would serve not only as a symbol of gratitude but also as a tangible asset to support firefighter-related programs and initiatives through proceeds from their sales. The Act specifies that the Secretary of the Treasury will mint three iterations of the coin: a $5 gold coin, a $1 silver coin, and a half-dollar clad coin, with a portion of the sales price designated as a surcharge benefiting the Foundation.

This initiative marks an important recognition of firefighters’ contributions and the challenges they face daily. With an estimated 1.1 million firefighters in the U.S., this acknowledgment extends to the extensive sacrifices made by them and their families. The coins will feature designs emblematic of the Memorial and will include inscriptions reflective of American values such as Liberty and In God We Trust.

By establishing this commemorative coin series, the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Coin Act seeks to create an ongoing legacy of remembrance while also providing financial support to programs dedicated to the well-being of the firefighting community. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jared Golden, D-ME, has introduced legislation to designate the Maine Forest and Logging Museum, located in Bradley, Maine, as the National Museum of Forestry and Logging History. This bill aims to recognize the museum's historical and cultural significance related to forestry and logging in the United States.

The proposal is a crucial move to elevate the museum's visibility and status on a national level. By designating it as the National Museum of Forestry and Logging History, Golden aims to enhance public awareness and tourism, potentially boosting the local economy. The Maine Forest and Logging Museum has operated since 1990, showcasing the state's rich logging traditions, educational exhibits, and artifacts that reflect the industry's vital role in Maine's history and economy.

This initiative emerged from a growing recognition of the importance of preserving and promoting forestry heritage, particularly as the industry faces modern challenges related to sustainability and environmental stewardship. Proponents argue that recognizing the museum at a national level will highlight the historical impact of logging on American landscapes and communities, providing a platform for education about responsible forestry practices.

The bill emphasizes not only preservation but also the need for educational outreach. It is poised to attract further partnerships and funding opportunities for the museum, which could enhance its programs and exhibits. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, stakeholders from the forestry industry, environmental groups, and local communities are rallying support, believing that this designation will foster appreciation for Maine's natural resources and the traditions rooted in them.

The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture for review, reflecting the bill's connection to agriculture and rural development themes in federal policy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-TX, has introduced the National Strategy for School Security Act, aiming to develop a comprehensive federal strategy to secure elementary and secondary schools against terrorism. The bill, which was introduced on March 21, 2025, seeks to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to collaborate with the Department of Education and other agencies to create a structured response to potential threats.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to the increasing concerns about school safety, particularly amid a backdrop of rising security threats. The proposed strategy would mandate the federal government to systematically review and address vulnerabilities in school systems while ensuring preparedness for potential terrorist activities. By establishing a concerted plan, the legislation seeks to enhance safety protocols and provide necessary resources for schools across the nation.

If enacted, the bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a national school security strategy within a year. This strategy would include an assessment of current federal programs, identification of specific vulnerabilities, and detailed actions necessary to close security gaps. It is designed to be dynamic, allowing for annual updates to adapt to evolving threats and fortify school defenses effectively.

A key component of the bill is its focus on collaboration across federal agencies, ensuring that schools are not working in isolation. The collaborative framework aims to utilize insights from various evaluations to provide a comprehensive approach, preventing unnecessary duplications of efforts.

As public scrutiny over school safety escalates, the National Strategy for School Security Act seeks to assure parents and communities that measures are being taken to protect students in educational settings.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-VA, has introduced a bill aimed at designating the United States Postal Service facility located at 901 West Main Street in Radford, Virginia, as the Richard H. Poff Post Office Building. The bill seeks to honor Richard H. Poff, a prominent figure in Virginia's political history, and acknowledge his contributions to public service.

This bill was introduced in response to calls from local constituents and civic leaders who believe that naming the post office after Poff would not only recognize his legacy but also foster community pride. Richard H. Poff served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1953 to 1973, during which he made significant contributions in various capacities, including his role in the House Judiciary Committee.

If passed, the bill would not only rename the post office but also provide a lasting tribute to Poff's commitment to public service. Designating public buildings after notable individuals helps to preserve their legacies and serves to inspire future generations. Residents of Radford have expressed strong support for the initiative, viewing it as a way to connect the city’s present with its historical roots.

The introduction of H.R.2260 underscores the importance of recognizing local history and figures who contributed to the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pablo Hernández, D-PR, has introduced the Strengthening Oversight of DHS Intelligence Act, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) oversight of intelligence operations. The bill seeks to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, ensuring that the sharing, retention, and dissemination of intelligence information align with the protection of privacy rights, civil rights, and civil liberties.

The introduction of this bill comes in the wake of increasing public concern over privacy and civil liberties in the context of national security. As intelligence operations have expanded, critics argue that oversight mechanisms have not kept pace, potentially leading to violations of individual rights. The proposed legislation intends to establish clearer guidelines requiring coordination with the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis to safeguard these rights. 

Key provisions include mandates for training intelligence personnel about privacy rights and civil liberties, which reflects a growing awareness of the importance of ethical practices in intelligence work. The framework aims to create a balance between effective national security measures and the protection of citizens' rights.

The potential impact of the Strengthening Oversight of DHS Intelligence Act is significant; if enacted, it would formalize oversight practices that could lead to more transparent intelligence activities. By reinforcing accountability within the DHS, the act seeks to foster greater public trust in government operations.

As this bill moves to the Committee on Homeland Security, supporters hope it will be viewed favorably, citing the need for an increase in safeguards crucial to maintaining the balance between security and individual liberties. The bill's future remains contingent on committee discussions and potential amendments before any considerations in the full House.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-IA, has introduced the Flexibility for Workers Education Act, seeking to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The bill aims to exclude certain non-productive times from the calculation of hours worked, specifically regarding employee participation in lectures and training programs outside regular working hours.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about improving workplace flexibility and addressing employee concerns over unpaid hours spent on professional development. Many workers report having to attend mandatory training and other non-work-related activities without compensation, leading to increased frustration and calls for reform. Proponents argue that this bill would provide essential flexibility for workers, allowing them to choose professional development opportunities without the pressure of financial penalties for non-attendance.

If enacted, the legislation would clarify that time spent changing clothes or participating in employer-sponsored training would not count as hours worked, provided these activities are voluntary and occur outside of regular hours. This means employees would be incentivized to engage in additional training opportunities without risking overtime violations, potentially enhancing their skills and career prospects without impacting their take-home pay.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, particularly in industries that rely heavily on continuous education and training. As organizations evolve and adopt new technologies, employee skills must keep pace. However, the challenge remains in ensuring that voluntary participation leads to genuine skill development without inadvertently creating a divide between those who can afford to invest time and those who cannot.

The Flexibility for Workers Education Act will now be reviewed by the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where its future will be determined as lawmakers assess its implications on labor practices nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ro Khanna, D-CA, has introduced the Telehealth Coverage Act of 2025, a significant piece of legislation aimed at permanently extending and expanding telehealth services covered under Medicare. This action comes in response to the growing demand for remote healthcare services, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bill seeks to amend the Social Security Act to maintain the telehealth flexibilities that were temporarily authorized during the pandemic. It aims to expand access to these services by removing in-person requirements for certain procedures, making it easier for patients to receive care from their homes. This legislative effort could have a profound impact on millions of Americans, especially those living in rural or underserved areas where healthcare access is limited.

The initiative reflects a broader shift towards embracing digital health solutions. By ensuring that telehealth can remain a viable option, the Act intends to address ongoing healthcare challenges, including accessibility and affordability. The proposed measures will allow a broader range of healthcare practitioners to provide telehealth services and include provisions for utilizing audio-only communications, expanding the definition of eligible telehealth services.

As telehealth has become increasingly integral to the healthcare landscape, this bill represents an essential move to establish a more permanent infrastructure for virtual care. By addressing the needs of diverse patient populations—especially those with limited English proficiency or those requiring specific medical follow-ups—the Act emphasizes inclusivity and comprehensive care.

The Telehealth Coverage Act of 2025 has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Michael Lawler, R-NY, has introduced the Service-Connected Suicide Compensation Act, aiming to provide financial support for the families of veterans suffering from service-connected mental disorders who tragically die by suicide. The bill would mandate the automatic payment of dependency and indemnity compensation to the survivors of affected veterans, ensuring they receive necessary assistance during a profoundly difficult time.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing concerns regarding the mental health crisis facing veterans, particularly those battling service-related mental illnesses. Estimates suggest that many veterans may face heightened risks of suicide due to these conditions, making legislation that aids their families a critical step in addressing this pressing issue.

If enacted, the Service-Connected Suicide Compensation Act would amend Title 38 of the United States Code, directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to prioritize the needs of survivors in the aftermath of a veteran's suicide related to a diagnosed mental disorder. This legislative effort underscores the urgent need to address the ongoing mental health challenges within the veteran community and the devastating impact of suicide.

The proposed policy could have far-reaching implications. By providing financial support, it seeks to alleviate some of the burdens faced by grieving families, thereby contributing to their emotional and financial stability. Supporters believe that this act may encourage more open discussions about mental health within the military and help streamline assistance for those in dire circumstances.

This bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for further consideration. As lawmakers delve deeper into mental health issues, the passage of the Service-Connected Suicide Compensation Act may represent a critical step toward honoring and supporting America's veterans and their families.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-NY, has introduced the No Foreign Election Interference Act aimed at curbing foreign influence in U.S. political campaigns. This legislation seeks to impose penalties on tax-exempt organizations that receive contributions from foreign nationals and subsequently donate to political committees.

The motivation behind this bill stems from increasing concerns over foreign interference in American elections, particularly in the wake of recent controversies surrounding campaign funding. Advocates for the bill argue that foreign contributions can undermine the integrity of the democratic process, prompting calls for stricter regulations. Under this proposed legislation, organizations that accept foreign contributions and make political donations would face severe financial penalties, amounting to double the contribution made. Furthermore, repeat offenders could risk losing their tax-exempt status entirely, should they violate the new rules more than twice.

The potential impact of the No Foreign Election Interference Act is significant, as it aims to create a more transparent and accountable political financing system. By deterring foreign contributions, the bill seeks to bolster voter confidence in the legitimacy of election outcomes. Legislative watchers note that this move could provoke debate among lawmakers over the balance between free speech in political funding and safeguarding national sovereignty in the electoral process.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. If passed, the amendments would take effect for contributions made after January 1, 2026. As political dynamics evolve, the No Foreign Election Interference Act represents a proactive step toward addressing the complexities of foreign influence in U.S. politics.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Thomas Massie, R-KY, has introduced the NICS Data Reporting Act, a proposed legislation aimed at enhancing transparency regarding firearm purchase eligibility. The bill mandates that the Attorney General submits an annual report containing demographic data on individuals found ineligible to purchase firearms via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). 

Massie's initiative responds to ongoing debates about firearm regulations and the demographics of those affected by restrictions. Advocates argue that understanding the demographic makeup of those denied gun purchases is vital for assessing the fairness and effectiveness of the current gun control framework. The bill stipulates that the annual report must include details such as race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, age, disability status, and average annual income of the rejected applicants.

The potential impact of this legislation can be profound, as it seeks to inform lawmakers and the public about who is disproportionately affected by firearm restrictions. Supporters claim that increased transparency will enable more informed discussions around policy reforms and possible improvements to the background check process. 

Previously, there has been criticism regarding the lack of comprehensive data in understanding how gun regulations impact various communities. By requiring the reporting of demographic information, the NICS Data Reporting Act aims to provide a clearer picture, possibly addressing concerns about bias in the implementation of gun laws.

The bill has been brought before the House Judiciary Committee, marking its first step towards legislative consideration. As potential discussions unfold, stakeholders from various political backgrounds are likely to weigh in on the significance of demographic data in shaping future gun policy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lisa McClain, R-MI, has introduced the Wastewater Infrastructure Pollution Prevention and Environmental Safety Act, known as the WIPPES Act, aimed at curbing environmental hazards associated with disposable wipes. The proposed legislation mandates “Do Not Flush” labeling on certain products, particularly premoistened wipes, which are often incorrectly flushed and contribute significantly to wastewater management challenges.

This legislation is a response to the growing concern over the environmental impact of improperly flushed disposable wipes that can clog sewage systems and lead to costly infrastructure damage. With communities facing increased expenses from maintaining and repairing their wastewater treatment systems, the WIPPES Act seeks to mitigate these issues through preventative labeling standards.

Under this bill, manufacturers would be required to clearly label their products with a recognizable symbol and the text “Do Not Flush,” ensuring consumers are aware of proper disposal methods. This labeling would apply to wipes marketed for personal care, cleaning, and household use, helping to educate the public about the potential risks associated with flushing such materials.

The WIPPES Act is anticipated to have a dual impact: reducing the environmental burden on wastewater systems and informing consumers about the appropriate disposal methods for these products. As the market for disposable wipes continues to expand, this legislation emphasizes the necessity for responsible consumer behavior and increased manufacturer accountability.

McClain's bill has garnered support from other lawmakers, including Mr. Mullin, Mr. Kean, and Mr. Huffman, and was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. If enacted, the law would bolster efforts to safeguard water systems while promoting more sustainable practices among consumers and manufacturers alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark Messmer, R-IN, has introduced the Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act, a legislative proposal aimed at facilitating employer-supported childcare and dependent care services. The bill seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by excluding payments and services for childcare from overtime compensation calculations.

The introduction of this bill is a response to the growing concerns about workforce retention and productivity. Many employers struggle to retain staff due to the increasing demands of childcare and elder care responsibilities that employees face. Messmer's solution aims to alleviate this burden by allowing employers to provide childcare support without the financial implications of affecting overtime pay.

Should the bill pass, it is expected to have a significant impact on both employers and workers. By facilitating access to childcare and elder care services, the legislation could help reduce absenteeism and increase job satisfaction among employees who juggle caregiving and work. Ultimately, supporters argue that this act will enhance workforce participation by making it easier for parents and caregivers to balance home and job commitments.

Historically, the lack of adequate support for childcare has been a persistent challenge in the American labor market. As more families rely on dual incomes, the need for viable care solutions has become increasingly critical. The proposed changes seek to empower employers by making it more feasible for them to offer supplementary care services without incurring additional financial penalties.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce and has already garnered attention from various stakeholders concerned about labor and family welfare. The legislative process will determine the viability of this proposal, with discussions around its implications likely to shape future employment policies.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Burgess Owens, R-UT, has introduced the Change of Ownership and Conversion Improvement Act aimed at streamlining the review process for changes of control among higher education institutions. The bill was presented to the House on March 21, 2025, and will modify the application procedure under the Higher Education Act of 1965.

The legislation responds to challenges faced by educational institutions during mergers and acquisitions, which often delay necessary transformations within the sector. Current review processes by the Department of Education are criticized for taking excessive time, sometimes up to five years. By expediting these reviews, the act intends to encourage beneficial mergers that promote innovation and student-centered improvements across American education.

Moreover, the bill empowers the Department of Education to charge a fee for processing change-of-ownership applications, ensuring that the entities involved bear the financial burden rather than taxpayers. Fees collected will directly support enhancing the review capacity of the Department. By mandating expedited evaluations, the act strives to reduce unnecessary bureaucratic delays, promoting timely operational changes within institutions that can enhance overall educational effectiveness.

Owens emphasized that with changing demographics and evolving educational demands, more institutions are likely to consider mergers or conversions in the coming years. The process outlined in the act includes provisions for robust monitoring of newly converted nonprofit institutions to prevent financial mismanagement or ethical conflicts. This proactive approach ensures that higher education remains responsive to the evolving needs of students and society at large.

As universities and colleges navigate a rapidly changing environment, the Change of Ownership and Conversion Improvement Act aims to modernize regulatory frameworks, making them more efficient and effective in meeting contemporary educational demands.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, has introduced the Freeze Aid For Student Assaulters Act of 2025, aiming to restrict certain individuals from receiving federal financial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The bill proposes that those convicted of specific offenses—including assault against police officers or rioting—should be deemed ineligible for federal educational support.

The introduction of this legislation follows rising concerns over campus violence and the safety of educational environments. By targeting individuals with serious criminal backgrounds, the bill seeks to foster a safer atmosphere in higher education institutions. Advocates argue that disallowing these individuals from accessing federal aid is a necessary step to hold them accountable and to discourage violent behavior in academic settings.

If enacted, the FAFSA Act of 2025 would apply to any individual convicted of violent crimes defined under the bill's provisions. Those affected would not only lose eligibility for grants and loans but would also be required to repay any federal grants received previously, which would then convert to loans with interest. This stringent policy intends to emphasize the seriousness of these offenses and their consequences regarding higher education support.

Supporters of the bill believe that it serves as a deterrent against violent conduct, contributing positively to campus safety and integrity. Critics, however, raise concerns about the potential consequences for students who may make mistakes but are otherwise on a rehabilitative path. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, it will be a pivotal moment for both supporters and opponents to voice their views on this contentious issue surrounding education and public safety.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, introduced the UPRISERS Act on March 21, 2025, aiming to enhance immigration enforcement regarding foreign students. The bill proposes to revoke the visas of international students who have been convicted of assaulting a police officer or related offenses, such as rioting.

The introduction of the UPRISERS Act comes amidst ongoing national debates about crime, public safety, and college campuses' political climates. The bill underscores concerns surrounding the behavior of a minority of foreign students, particularly those participating in protests that escalate into violence. By targeting specific offenses linked to law enforcement and public order, the legislation seeks to tighten controls over student visa eligibility and maintain a safe environment in the country.

If enacted, the UPRISERS Act would allow the Secretary of State to revoke student visas for individuals admitted under sections 101(a)(15)(F), (J), or (M) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, targeting those convicted of assaults on law enforcement or rioting-related offenses. Furthermore, it would classify such violations as grounds for deportation, thus amplifying the stakes for international students regarding their conduct while in the United States.

Supporters of the bill argue it is a necessary measure to protect communities from violence associated with protests. Critics, however, warn that it could unjustly affect students engaging in peaceful activism or dissent, raising fears of infringement on rights and freedoms. As the conversation around immigration and crime continues, Rep. Pfluger's UPRISERS Act has entered the legislative arena, with implications for future policies regarding foreign students in the U.S. The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on the Judiciary.

This bill proposes a framework where appeals of these injunctions will be directed exclusively to the Supreme Court, aiming to streamline judicial processes and reduce the forums available for legal challenges.

The introduction of this bill comes on the heels of growing concerns about the broad and often disparate impacts of nationwide injunctions. Critics argue that such injunctions create inconsistent legal standards across the country, allowing certain parties to shop for judges who are more likely to rule in their favor. By mandating that appeals of nationwide injunctions go directly to the Supreme Court, the bill seeks to establish a unified legal precedent, ensuring a consistent interpretation of federal laws.

If enacted, the Court Shopping Deterrence Act could reshape how cases related to federal statutes and regulations are handled in lower courts, potentially expediting legal proceedings. This decisiveness may also help uphold the integrity of federal authority, reducing instances where divergent rulings impede implementation of national policies.

Additionally, the bill aims to address concerns raised by lawmakers and legal experts regarding the expanding power of district judges, which can create an imbalance in the judicial system. By focusing appeal jurisdictions, the legislation intends to safeguard against overreach and clarify the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter in matters of significant national concern.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration, where it will undergo scrutiny and evaluation before potentially moving to the floor for a vote.

The bill (H.R. 2274) was introduced on 03/21/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced the SCHOOL Act of 2025, a legislative proposal aimed at allowing federal education funds to follow students regardless of their chosen educational environment—be it public, private, or home schooling. This bill seeks to modernize funding approaches under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, promoting greater educational choice for families across Texas and the nation.

The introduction of the SCHOOL Act comes amid growing calls for educational reform, particularly in light of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many parents had to navigate shifting learning formats and are now advocating for increased flexibility in how educational funds are allocated. By allowing funds to be tied directly to students, supporters of the bill argue it will empower families to choose the institutions that best suit their children's needs and learning styles.

If passed, the SCHOOL Act would enable state educational agencies to allocate federal grant funds in a manner that considers each child's enrollment in their respective educational settings. This includes provisions for using these funds for a variety of educational resources, from curriculum materials to private school tuition, thereby broadening the scope of how families can support their children's education.

Critics of the bill, however, warn of potential downsides, including concerns about the redirection of funds from public schools and the risk of exacerbating educational inequalities. With the bill now referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, it will undergo further scrutiny before any potential advancement in Congress. The impact of this legislation could be significant, establishing a framework for educational funding that reflects the diverse learning preferences of students across the country.

"$H billintroh-250321-hr2276",40434,"Rep. Roy Introduces CRT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced the Combating Racist Teaching in Schools Act, aimed at prohibiting federal funding to educational institutions that promote certain race-based theories. The bill, which seeks to address what its proponents view as problematic educational practices, focuses on preventing the allocation of federal funds to schools that encourage teachings suggesting the superiority or inferiority of races or perceive the U.S. as fundamentally racist.

The introduction of the CRT Act comes amidst an ongoing national debate regarding the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and related topics in educational institutions across the country. Advocates argue that some race-based theories can contribute to divisive narratives and undermine national unity, while opponents contend that they are essential for understanding systemic racism and its impact on society.

If passed, the legislation would prevent federal aid from reaching any educational institution that teaches or requires belief in concepts that classify individuals by race in a negative or prejudicial light. This could significantly affect funding for schools that incorporate comprehensive curricula including discussions of race, identity, and history, leading to potential challenges for state and local education agencies seeking federal support. 

The bill is part of a broader effort among some legislators to address perceived ideological biases in educational settings. Proponents argue it aims to cleanse educational content of radical racial theories, while critics warn it might restrict discussions on race, privilege, and historical injustices. As it moves to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, the outcome may reshape how educational institutions address race-related topics and how they receive federal funding.

"$H billintroh-250321-hr2277",40434,"Rep. Sessions Introduces FACT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pete Sessions, R-TX, has introduced the Federal Accountability Committee for Transparency Act (FACT Act), aiming to enhance oversight and accountability of federal pandemic spending. The bill seeks to extend the life of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) until December 2026 while simultaneously renaming it to the Fraud Prevention and Accountability Committee.

The FACT Act responds to growing concerns about the substantial funds disbursed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have reportedly been susceptible to fraud. By transforming PRAC into the Fraud Prevention and Accountability Committee, the proposed legislation emphasizes the responsibility to scrutinize the government’s use of pandemic-related funds meticulously. With the extension of oversight, lawmakers believe this alteration will ensure that measures are put in place to prevent waste and fraud before it occurs.

The extension and rebranding of this committee come at a time when public confidence in regulatory bodies is crucial. Recent audits revealed alarming instances of misuse of funds intended for pandemic relief, underscoring the need for stronger oversight mechanisms. Through the FACT Act, Rep. Sessions aims to address these vulnerabilities by maintaining a dedicated group focused solely on accountability in federal spending.

This legislation is significant as it seeks to pivot from mere compliance monitoring to a proactive approach in identifying and preventing fraud. The move to create a Fraud Prevention and Accountability Committee is expected to have a wide-ranging impact on federal financial management and could serve as a model for future accountability initiatives across various government programs. As it stands, the FACT Act will now move to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further evaluation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark Takano, D-CA, has introduced the Survivor Benefits Delivery Improvement Act, aimed at enhancing access to benefits for veterans’ survivors and improving outreach to those who have served in uniformed services. This legislation seeks to amend title 38 of the United States Code to ensure that dependents, including surviving spouses and children, have equitable access to essential benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The introduction of this bill is motivated by ongoing concerns regarding the inadequacy of current outreach efforts and accessibility for veterans' survivors, particularly from underserved demographics. The act intends to close gaps in support by mandating the collection of demographic data on recipients of various veterans’ benefits, which can help the VA better identify and reach out to those eligible for assistance.

One key aspect of the legislation is the requirement for the VA to develop an outreach strategy tailored for underserved demographics. This includes regular communication with survivors of veterans to ensure they are aware of available benefits, including disability compensation and burial benefits. Additionally, the bill calls for the establishment of full-time positions at VA call centers to assist in delivering these outreach services.

By providing data-driven insights into the demographics of benefit recipients, the Survivor Benefits Delivery Improvement Act aims to create a more inclusive framework that addresses the needs of all veterans' dependents, regardless of background or circumstances. This legislation poses the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for countless families affected by the loss of service members, enhancing their awareness of the support available during challenging times. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the No Tax on LOSAP Act, aiming to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount excluded from gross income for payments to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services and clarify that payments under length of service award programs (LOSAP) are qualified payments.

The bill addresses the financial challenges faced by many volunteer first responders who often serve their communities without compensation. By raising the exclusion limit from $50 to $1,000, the legislation seeks to provide meaningful financial relief to those who dedicate countless hours to volunteer emergency services. Currently, funds awarded under LOSAP programs are often seen as taxable income, which can discourage participation and burden volunteers with unexpected tax liabilities.

The introduction of this bill comes at a crucial moment as many volunteer departments struggle to recruit and retain personnel. The legislation’s potential impact could help ease the financial burden on those involved in essential community services while fostering a more robust pipeline of volunteer responders. Furthermore, strengthening volunteer programs could enhance community preparedness for emergencies.

The bill is significant because it not only increases the financial benefits for first responders but also reinforces the value placed on their service. First responders play a critical role in community safety, and ensuring they are not penalized financially for their volunteer efforts is a priority for many legislators and constituents alike.

As the bill proceeds through the legislative process, its supporters hope it will garner bipartisan support, reflecting a widespread commitment to supporting volunteer service in emergency response across the nation. The No Tax on LOSAP Act was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-FL, has introduced the BIRD Energy and U.S.-Israel Energy Center Reauthorization Act, aimed at enhancing energy cooperation between the United States and Israel. This legislation seeks to extend and expand the existing United States-Israel Energy Cooperation program, which supports bilateral research and development in energy technologies.

The reauthorization of this program comes in light of the growing importance of energy innovation to both nations. The BIRD Energy Foundation was established in 2009 to foster collaboration in energy development, addressing challenges like clean energy commercialization and energy security. By increasing the funding cap from $2 million to $5 million and extending the program through fiscal year 2031, this bill seeks to bolster efforts in renewable energy, energy storage, and cybersecurity.

This legislative push reflects a commitment to tackle global energy issues with innovative solutions. Israel has been at the forefront of technological advancements in energy efficiency and renewables, making it an ideal partner for the U.S. in achieving shared energy goals. The bill expands the cooperation categories to include hydrogen energy, fusion energy, and even agrivoltaics, reflecting a broadening of the areas of focus to encompass new technologies critical to the future of energy.

The potential impact of this legislation is notable, with projections indicating that this enhanced partnership could create jobs, strengthen economic ties, and improve energy resilience.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Frederica S. Wilson, D-FL, has introduced the Strengthening Job Corps Act, aiming to reauthorize and enhance the Job Corps program to better assist opportunity youth in gaining essential skills for employment. This legislation outlines various modifications to the existing program, offering a comprehensive approach to meet the needs of young individuals seeking job training and education.

The Job Corps program has long served as a vital gateway for disadvantaged youth, providing them with educational resources and job training. However, many argue that the program requires updates to remain effective in today's workforce landscape. The reauthorization proposed in this bill seeks to expand access for participants by raising the maximum enrollment age to 28 for individuals with disabilities or justice-involved youth, thereby allowing more individuals to benefit from its services.

Among its noteworthy provisions, the bill includes enhanced performance metrics and accountability measures for Job Corps campuses, focusing on student outcomes such as employment rates and educational achievements post-graduation. This data-driven approach aims to ensure that participating campuses are held to higher standards, facilitating better preparation for the workforce for enrollees.

The legislation also addresses recruitment strategies, emphasizing the need for partnerships with local organizations and employers to create a more integrated support system for participants. By aligning the program more closely with local workforce development efforts, the bill aims to foster a pipeline of skilled workers tailored to meet community needs.

As Congress deliberates the Strengthening Job Corps Act, its potential impact on workforce development and youth empowerment continues to draw attention from various stakeholders, emphasizing the critical need for adaptive solutions in addressing today's employment challenges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Riley Moore, R-WV, has introduced the Respect Parents’ Childcare Choices Act to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The bill aims to broaden access to child care for families and enhance support for relatives acting as caregivers, ensuring that parents have the authority to select how their children are cared for.

Introduced on March 24, 2025, the bill responds to ongoing concerns about the accessibility and affordability of child care services in the United States. As many families face mounting financial pressure, the legislation proposes to allocate $14 billion annually through 2031 to support federal child care programs. The initiative also seeks to provide child care certificates, allowing parents to choose their preferred providers, including family members.

The proposed act aims to lift bureaucratic barriers that often limit the ability of relatives to provide care. Moreover, it mandates states to review and potentially remove regulations deemed excessive or burdensome for relative caregivers. This focus on relative care responds to growing advocacy for more inclusive child care solutions that honor family ties.

In addition to increasing financial allocations, the bill addresses the importance of maintaining educational standards among caregivers while respecting parental choice. The legislation emphasizes that funds can also be used for custodial family members, reinforcing the critical role of family in child-rearing.

If passed, the Respect Parents’ Childcare Choices Act could significantly reshape the landscape of child care in America, enhancing both quality and accessibility. It reflects an ongoing effort to adapt public policy to meet the current needs of families while maintaining essential health and safety standards.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Bost, R-IL, has introduced the Recognizing Community Organizations for Veteran Engagement and Recovery Act aimed at enhancing mental health care for veterans through partnerships with community organizations. This legislation seeks to authorize a pilot program that will provide grants to outpatient mental health facilities, ensuring that veterans have access to culturally competent, evidence-based mental health care.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns about the mental health crises facing veterans, particularly those living in underserved areas. By facilitating grants to local mental health providers, the RECOVER Act intends to bridge gaps in care, especially for those in both rural and urban settings who may have limited access to essential services. The program will prioritize facilities located near military installations or in high-risk areas, aligning resources where they are most needed.

Under the proposed pilot program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is instructed to oversee grant distribution to qualifying mental health care providers. Eligible organizations must have substantial experience in mental health services and demonstrate their ability to offer culturally competent care, with at least one trained clinician at each facility. The anticipated benefit of this requirement is that veterans will receive care tailored to their unique needs and backgrounds.

The legislation also ensures that veterans can access these services at no cost, prohibiting facilities from charging fees or denying services based on eligibility for reimbursement through other health programs. The pilot aims to serve thousands of veterans, resulting in increased enrollment in VA health systems and improved mental health outcomes. With an authorization of $20 million annually for three years, the RECOVER Act endeavors to create a lasting impact on veteran mental wellness across the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-IN, has introduced the Reduce Bureaucracy to Uplift Families Act, aimed at reforming the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to decrease administrative costs and enhance support for low-income families. The bill seeks to limit the portion of funds used for administrative expenses from 15% to 10%, ensuring more resources are directed toward direct assistance.

This legislative proposal emerges from ongoing concerns regarding the efficiency of welfare programs. Advocates argue that a significant amount of allocated funds has historically been diverted towards administrative overhead rather than directly benefiting families in need. With rising costs of living and persistent poverty rates, Yakym's bill is positioned as a crucial step toward providing better support to vulnerable households.

By amending the Social Security Act, the bill intends to enforce stricter regulatory measures on fund allocation, mandating that states prioritize actual assistance over bureaucratic expenses. The legislation also introduces penalties for states that fail to comply with the new administrative limits, potentially reducing their TANF grants by up to 5% in subsequent fiscal years if administrative thresholds are exceeded.

Supporters of the bill emphasize that reducing bureaucratic red tape is essential for streamlining assistance programs, thereby making it easier for families to receive the help they require. They assert that this approach not only enhances the effectiveness of welfare programs but also fosters greater accountability within state agencies managing these funds.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it faces scrutiny regarding its potential impact on state budgets and administrative operations. However, proponents remain optimistic, viewing it as a necessary reform to uplift families by ensuring that resources are utilized effectively and responsibly.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nellie Pou, D-NJ, has introduced the DHS Basic Training Accreditation Improvement Act of 2025 aimed at enhancing the accreditation processes for basic training programs within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The legislation seeks to establish robust reporting requirements to monitor the accreditation status of these programs, ensuring they meet recognized standards and remain compliant over time.

The rationale behind the bill arises from concerns regarding the effectiveness and consistency of training provided to personnel in critical roles within the DHS. By requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to annually report on each program's accreditation status, the measure aims to foster greater accountability and transparency. The inclusion of details regarding initial accreditation dates, reasons for any lack of accreditation, and the identification of program managers provides a comprehensive approach to improving standards.

The potential impact of the bill is significant; it promises to bolster the preparedness of law enforcement personnel by ensuring they receive training that adheres to high standards. Law enforcement agencies, particularly those in rural and remote communities, may significantly benefit from improved access to training programs. Furthermore, the bill also tasks DHS with developing advanced systems and technologies to facilitate training access, thereby enhancing domestic preparedness against terrorism and other homeland security threats.

This legislation is being considered in the House committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary. If enacted, it could usher in a new era of improved training protocols for key personnel tasked with safeguarding the nation. The annual reporting will cease only when all relevant training programs achieve accreditation, marking a crucial step toward consistent and quality training across the DHS.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Burchett, R-TN, introduced the American Genetic Privacy Act aimed at safeguarding personal genetic data from being exploited by foreign entities, particularly the People's Republic of China. The bill, introduced on March 24, 2025, prohibits the sale or disclosure of individual genetic information obtained through commercial DNA testing services to Chinese companies or organizations.

Particularly timely, this legislation responds to growing concerns about the potential misuse of genetic data in espionage, bioweapons development, and discriminatory practices. Lawmakers emphasize the need for stronger privacy protections as genetic testing becomes increasingly popular, with millions of Americans using services that analyze their DNA for genealogical or health purposes. 

The bill seeks to mitigate risks associated with genetic data sharing and outlines specific enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be tasked with overseeing violations of the act, treating them as unfair or deceptive acts, subjecting offenders to significant penalties. 

Recent high-profile data breaches have prompted lawmakers and citizens alike to advocate for tighter regulations surrounding personal information. As the controversy surrounding data privacy intensifies, this initiative underscores a bipartisan commitment to protect citizens from potential threats posed by foreign access to sensitive genetic information. 

The American Genetic Privacy Act is now under review by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it could undergo further adjustments before advancing to the broader legislative process. Supporters hope the bill will foster more secure handling of genetic data, ultimately empowering individuals to take control of their privacy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-OR, has introduced the Protecting Families from Inflation Act, a legislative measure aimed at analyzing the effects of recent tariffs on consumer goods and services in the United States. The proposed bill seeks to require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to conduct a comprehensive study on how tariffs implemented from 2017 onward affect costs for American families and small businesses.

In the context of rising inflation affecting households nationwide, the introduction of this bill addresses pressing economic concerns. The study mandated by the Act would evaluate the aggregated impact of all U.S. tariffs over the past several years and report findings to Congress within 270 days. This timely initiative aims to provide policymakers with clear insights into how tariff regulations influence market prices and consumer behavior.

The Protecting Families from Inflation Act reflects a growing bipartisan consensus around the need for measurable economic data, particularly in light of increased scrutiny on trade practices and their consequences. As tariffs have contributed to fluctuating prices in various sectors, including goods essential for everyday living, the bill aims to bridge the gap between policymakers and the economic realities faced by families.

Should this legislation be enacted, it could pave the way for potential revisions in tariff policies that may alleviate financial pressures on Americans experiencing heightened costs of living. By focusing on the actual data regarding tariff impacts, the Protecting Families from Inflation Act holds the promise of a more informed approach to handling inflationary pressures, ultimately aiming to protect consumers and small businesses from undue financial strain.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Earl L. Buddy Carter, R-GA, has introduced the Common Sense Air Regulations Act, a legislative effort aimed at nullifying a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule concerning air quality standards. The bill seeks to overturn the EPA's Reconsideration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter, which was finalized in March 2024.

Carter's proposed legislation comes amid growing concerns from various stakeholders, including industry representatives, who argue that stringent air quality regulations have adverse effects on economic growth and job creation. The EPA’s ruling is perceived as a potential barrier for businesses, particularly in sectors reliant on fossil fuels and other emission-producing activities. By targeting this regulation, the Common Sense Air Regulations Act aims to alleviate regulatory pressures and foster a more conducive environment for economic development.

Supporters of the bill contend that air quality should be maintained without overly stringent regulations that could stifle growth. They argue that the standards set by the EPA are overly ambitious and may not adequately consider the economic ramifications for both small businesses and larger industries. Moreover, proponents maintain that frequent adjustments to air quality standards contribute to uncertainty for businesses and hinder long-term planning.

On the other hand, critics warn that rolling back air quality standards poses a threat to public health and the environment. They argue that such actions could compromise efforts to ensure clean air for communities, especially in regions already experiencing high levels of pollution. The debate around the Common Sense Air Regulations Act highlights the persistent tension between environmental accountability and economic facilitation—a dichotomy that will likely continue to shape legislative discussions. 

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for review, its implications will be closely monitored by both environmental advocates and industry leaders.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter, R-GA, has introduced the Proportional Reviews for Broadband Deployment Act aimed at accelerating broadband infrastructure development by exempting specific facilities requests from extensive environmental and historic preservation reviews. This legislation seeks to streamline the deployment process essential for expanding internet access in underserved areas.

The Act stems from growing concerns regarding the lengthy review processes that often delay broadband expansion projects. With a significant portion of the U.S. lacking sufficient high-speed internet access, particularly in rural regions, this bill is seen as a pivotal step toward ensuring that necessary infrastructure can be erected more swiftly and efficiently. By reducing bureaucratic hurdles, the legislation aims to facilitate the growth of telecom investments and promote greater digital connectivity across the nation.

Under the proposed measure, eligible facilities requests made under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 will not trigger the in-depth assessments typically required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). This means that many broadband projects could commence sooner, significantly enhancing local economies reliant on digital infrastructure.

The implications of this bill extend beyond merely faster deployments. Experts suggest that by expediting broadband installation, communities will benefit from improved educational resources, telehealth services, and overall economic viability. As such, this legislation reflects a broader bipartisan effort to address America’s digital divide. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration, marking it as a priority in the current legislative agenda.

The bill (H.R. 2289) was introduced on 03/24/2025.

"$H billintroh-250324-hr2291",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces GARD Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the Gift Accountability, Reporting, and Disclosures Act (GARD Act), aiming to enhance transparency in the receipt and management of foreign gifts by federal employees. The proposed legislation seeks to amend existing regulations under Title 5 of the United States Code, requiring federal agencies to report detailed information about foreign gifts to the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of State.

The GARD Act was motivated by increasing concerns over undue foreign influence in U.S. politics and governance. By mandating rigorous reporting and accountability measures, the bill hopes to prevent potential conflicts of interest that may arise when public officials accept gifts from foreign entities. The legislation emphasizes the necessity for federal employees to disclose not only the source of any foreign gifts but also their eventual disposition.

This bill is seen as a critical step towards fostering public trust in government integrity. If passed, the GARD Act would implement a late fee for employees who fail to submit their statements on time, aiming to bolster compliance. It also proposes a system for public access to gift listings, mirroring the current mechanisms for financial disclosure reports, enhancing public scrutiny.

In a landscape where foreign engagements in American politics are under scrutiny, the GARD Act underscores the growing demand for transparency in government processes. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will undergo further evaluation. As the dialogue surrounding foreign influence continues, this legislation could serve as a cornerstone for future reforms aimed at safeguarding the ethical conduct of public officials.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-NC, has introduced the Economic Opportunity for Distressed Communities Act, aimed at incentivizing investments in economically distressed areas, notably those requiring environmental remediation such as brownfield and superfund sites. This legislation seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to establish favorable tax treatment for capital gains reinvested in these designated opportunity zones.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to ongoing challenges faced by underserved communities, often hindered by a lack of investment and economic development. By creating a framework for favorable tax treatment, the bill aims to stimulate business growth and community revitalization in these neglected areas. Investors can exclude capital gains from taxable income if they invest those earnings into qualified distressed opportunity funds within a specified timeframe.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant. It not only promotes economic activities in areas that are often overlooked but also addresses critical environmental issues by incentivizing clean-up and development projects. Supporters argue that revitalizing these locations can lead to job creation and improved local economies, benefiting both the communities and the broader national economy.

Prior to this initiative, attempts to boost investment in such regions have faced numerous barriers. This bill provides a structured approach, reinforcing the government’s commitment to fostering equity and improvement in economically disadvantaged areas. The proposal has quickly gained attention among various stakeholders, including economic development advocates and environmental organizations, who see the alignment of economic growth with ecological restoration.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation and potential modifications, underscoring the legislative focus on creating sustainable economic opportunities across the nation.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2191",40434,"Rep. Griffith Introduces Physician Led and Rural Access to Quality Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-VA, has introduced a bipartisan bill aimed at amending the Social Security Act to enhance access to healthcare in rural areas by revising physician self-referral exemptions associated with physician-owned hospitals. This legislation seeks to address significant barriers that rural populations face in obtaining quality health services.

The introduction of the Physician Led and Rural Access to Quality Care Act comes in response to growing concerns about healthcare access in remote communities. Many rural areas struggle with fewer healthcare facilities and specialists, pushing residents to travel long distances for care. Griffith's bill aims to facilitate the establishment and expansion of physician-owned hospitals in these underserved regions, enabling better access to local healthcare services.

A key feature of the bill is the designation of covered rural hospitals, which are defined as facilities located more than 35 miles from the nearest hospital or critical access hospital. By broadening self-referral exemptions for these institutions, the bill allows them to offer a wider range of medical services without the restrictions typically placed on physician-owned facilities.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it encourages the growth of healthcare facilities in rural communities. By enabling local physicians to establish and expand hospitals, it could lead to improved healthcare outcomes and reduced travel times for patients needing medical attention.

In addition to its immediate objective of expanding healthcare access, this bill represents a collaborative effort among various stakeholders, including healthcare providers and advocates. It reflects a growing recognition of the need to adapt healthcare policies to better serve rural populations, ensuring that quality care is readily available to all Americans, regardless of their geographic location.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-WI, has introduced the Air America Act, aimed at providing compensation to employees of Air America who supported U.S. operations from 1950 to 1976. The bill will allocate funds for individuals who risked their lives in conflict zones, recognizing their contributions and sacrifices during tumultuous periods.

The introduction of this bill follows growing advocacy for acknowledgment and reparations for past actions by private organizations associated with the U.S. government. Air America, a CIA front, provided crucial support during the Cold War, engaging in rescue missions and logistical operations. Many employees faced dire risks, including high casualty rates while safeguarding U.S. interests abroad.

If passed, the legislation will offer a one-time payment of $40,000 to qualifying employees who served five years or more, with additional rewards for longer service durations. Survivors of those who died while serving will also be eligible for compensation, ensuring that the legacy of these individuals is honored. The bill establishes a funding limit of $60 million, requiring potential adjustments if the total approved claims surpass this threshold.

Supporters of the bill argue it addresses long-standing grievances and provides a measure of justice for those who often remain unrecognized for their service. The initiative also emphasizes the United States' responsibility to acknowledge and compensate private contractors who contributed to national security, reflecting a shift toward recognizing the complexities of historical military engagements.

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for further deliberation. As discussions evolve, its proponents hope to expedite the process, ensuring timely support for those eligible, thereby fostering a culture of accountability and respect for past sacrifices.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-WI, introduced the FEHB Protection Act of 2025 aimed at enhancing oversight and integrity within the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The legislation mandates strict verification processes for individuals seeking to add family members to their health plans, ensuring that only eligible dependents are enrolled.

With rising concerns about potential fraud within the FEHB program, Grothman's bill focuses on establishing comprehensive audits and verification procedures to safeguard taxpayer dollars. Current estimates suggest that improper enrollments could be costing the government millions annually, prompting urgent reform in administration practices.

The proposed legislation requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to implement regulations for validating qualifying life events when enrollees wish to add family members. These measures aim to bolster eligibility checks and prevent misuse of the healthcare benefit system. Additionally, the bill stipulates a three-year period for conducting a thorough audit of family member enrollments to eliminate individuals who do not meet eligibility criteria.

Another significant aspect of the bill includes enhanced funding for OPM oversight activities. The financial provisions set forth aim to facilitate ongoing audits and strengthen the enforcement of eligibility standards, thereby ensuring that the benefits offered under the program are used appropriately.

As healthcare costs continue to escalate, the FEHB Protection Act of 2025 seeks to not only protect the integrity of the federal health benefits system but also provide reassurance to taxpayers that their interests are being adequately safeguarded. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further review.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Josh Harder, D-CA, has introduced the Ending Drug Trafficking in Our Communities Act, aimed at enhancing the United States' response to drug-related issues by reauthorizing and modifying the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program. The legislation seeks to allocate $400 million annually for six years, from 2026 through 2031, to strengthen efforts against drug trafficking and related offenses.

This bill reflects an urgent response to the ongoing crisis urban and rural communities face with drug trafficking and resulting overdoses. The need for such legislation arises amidst rising concerns over opioid use and other illegal drugs that have devastated many regions across the country. By reauthorizing the HIDTA Program, the bill aims to ensure that federal resources are directed effectively to regions heavily impacted by drugs.

The proposed modifications to the HIDTA Program include a focus on identifying “promising practices” that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of drug enforcement actions. The legislation mandates the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to evaluate these practices and implement them across all HIDTA regions. This approach emphasizes collaboration and evidence-based strategies among federal, state, tribal, and local authorities.

Additionally, the legislation aims to improve communication and coordination among various law enforcement agencies, enabling them to respond quickly and efficiently to drug-related crimes. If passed, this act would not only aim to stem the tide of drug trafficking but also provide local communities with the necessary support to combat the adverse effects of substance abuse. This introduction marks a significant step toward addressing what has become a public health emergency for many Americans.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2195",40434,"Rep. Hayes Introduces Feed Hungry Veterans Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-CT, has introduced the Feed Hungry Veterans Act, aimed at expanding eligibility for disabled veterans to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. This legislation seeks to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, ensuring that veterans with significant service-connected disabilities can access vital nutritional support.

The introduction of this bill reflects growing concerns about food insecurity among veterans across the nation. Reports indicate a troubling trend of veterans experiencing higher rates of food deprivation compared to the general population. By expanding eligibility criteria, the Feed Hungry Veterans Act aims to address these disparities and ensure that those who have served their country are not left struggling to meet basic nutritional needs.

Under the proposed changes, veterans with at least one service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher, or those with multiple disabilities that meet specific thresholds, would be eligible for SNAP benefits. This also includes provisions for veterans deemed catastrophically disabled and those under the age of 65 receiving a pension. By broadening these criteria, the bill hopes to reduce barriers that currently prevent many veterans from accessing necessary assistance.

Supporters of the proposed legislation argue that increasing food security for veterans is a matter of dignity and respect for their service. The bill has garnered bipartisan support with multiple co-sponsors, indicating a collective recognition of the urgent need for such measures. As Congress evaluates the bill, its potential impact could be significant, not only in terms of individual well-being but also in uplifting families and communities that have been historically marginalized.

If enacted, the Feed Hungry Veterans Act would take effect on October 1, 2030, setting a future date for its implementation and allowing for essential legislative negotiations and adjustments along the way.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2196",40434,"Rep. Hudson Introduces Legislation to Extend Memorial Authority for EMS","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, has introduced legislation aimed at extending the authority of the National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in Washington, D.C. This bill, introduced on March 18, 2025, seeks to recognize and honor the sacrifices of emergency medical service providers across the nation.

The need for this bill arises from the growing recognition of the vital role that emergency medical services play in public health and safety. Currently, the foundation is authorized to establish a memorial honoring EMS professionals, but that authority is set to expire. By extending this authority, the legislation ensures that the memorial can be completed and dedicated as a lasting tribute to those who have dedicated their lives to saving others.

The impact of this bill is significant, as it reinforces the commitment of the U.S. government to acknowledge the critical contributions of EMS workers. The memorial would not only serve as a recognition of their service but also as a reminder to the public about the importance of these dedicated professionals in their communities. Moreover, the extension aligns with national efforts to improve the welfare and recognition of first responders.

This initiative is not without precedent; similar memorials exist for various services, including law enforcement and fire personnel. The introduction of this bill emphasizes the comprehensive acknowledgment of all emergency services, establishing a culture of honor and respect for those who risk their lives on a daily basis. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-SD, has introduced the “No 340B Savings for Transgender Care Act,” a legislative measure aimed at prohibiting 340B covered entities from utilizing savings obtained from the program for gender-affirming services. The bill was presented on March 18, 2025, and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The 340B Drug Pricing Program enables healthcare providers to purchase outpatient drugs at reduced prices, with the savings intended to support services for low-income patients. However, the newly proposed legislation seeks to restrict these savings specifically from being allocated to sex reassignment surgeries and hormonal therapies. This initiative aligns with ongoing national discussions regarding healthcare funding and the prioritization of services for transgender individuals.

This bill's introduction comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny surrounding funding for gender-affirming treatments, as organizations and lawmakers debate the ethics and implications of using taxpayer-subsidized savings for these specific medical services. Advocates on both sides of the issue have mobilized, with some highlighting that forbidding such allocations could potentially inhibit access to essential healthcare for transgender individuals, while supporters argue the feature is necessary to ensure funds are effectively directed.

The implications of the No 340B Savings for Transgender Care Act could be significant, increasing disparities in accessibility to gender-affirming care. If passed, the bill would formally alter the framework of the 340B program, impacting numerous healthcare providers who rely on these savings. With a growing focus on healthcare accessibility in the U.S., this legislation is poised to become a contentious subject in forthcoming debates in Congress.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2198",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces New REIT Subsidiary Asset Test Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kelly, R-PA, has introduced a bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the taxable Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) subsidiary asset test. The legislation proposes adjusting the asset threshold from 20 percent to 25 percent for taxable REIT subsidiaries, a move supporters believe will help stabilize the real estate market and bolster revenue streams.

The introduction of this bill comes as part of a broader initiative to revise tax codes that stakeholders argue have become increasingly restrictive for REITs over the years. By increasing the asset limit for taxable subsidiaries, proponents of the bill argue that it would enhance the financial flexibility of REITs, allowing them to diversify their investments and better serve shareholder interests.

The potential impact of this legislative change could be significant. According to industry experts, a more lenient asset test may encourage REITs to expand their business activities and investments in various sectors, thereby stimulating economic growth. The change could also incentivize REITs to maintain higher dividend payouts, ultimately benefiting investors and retirees who rely on these dividends as a source of income.

Historically, the taxable REIT subsidiary asset test has been a critical component of the operational framework for these entities. The proposed increase is viewed as a response to shifting market conditions and the need for REITs to adapt to a more dynamic economy. This bill, if passed, could mark a pivotal shift in the landscape of real estate investing and asset management.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. As discussions progress, stakeholders in the real estate sector will be closely monitoring the implications and potential outcomes of this proposed legislative change.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kelly, R-PA, has introduced the Restore Protections for Dialysis Patients Act aimed at reinforcing the rights of individuals undergoing dialysis treatment under Medicare. This legislation seeks to enhance the safeguards within the Medicare Secondary Payer Act by preventing discrimination against patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) when it comes to their healthcare coverage.

In recent years, dialysis patients have raised concerns about the unequal treatment they face from private health insurance plans, which often impose limitations on dialysis services that are not present for other medical treatments. The bill was introduced in response to these inequities, aiming to clarify that dialysis services should not be singled out for adverse treatment under health plans. The proposal emphasizes the necessity to prohibit insurers from shifting the financial responsibility of covering dialysis-related healthcare costs primarily onto Medicare.

Should this bill pass, its provisions may significantly impact the approximately 500,000 American adults receiving dialysis. The act aims to ensure these patients have equitable access to necessary services, thereby promoting better health outcomes and reducing the financial burden associated with their treatment. The bill also reaffirms Congress' original intent in the Medicare Secondary Payer Act to protect patients with ESRD from discriminatory practices.

The Restore Protections for Dialysis Patients Act has been referred to the Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce for further consideration. Stakeholders within the healthcare community are encouraged to monitor the legislation as it progresses through Congress, recognizing its potential to reshape the benefits landscape for dialysis patients across the nation.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2200",40434,"Rep. Kiggans Introduces Retention of Coast Guard Members Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, R-VA, has introduced a bill aimed at amending Title 14 of the United States Code to ensure the retention of enlisted members of the Coast Guard who have completed 18 or more but less than 20 years of service. This legislation seeks to address concerns regarding the involuntary separation of valuable personnel nearing retirement eligibility.  

Introduced on March 18, 2025, the bill is a response to staffing challenges within the Coast Guard and aims to secure experienced members in active duty roles until they reach the qualifications for retirement. Under the proposed amendments, enlisted members facing discharge will be retained if they are within two years of qualifying for retirement, thus providing them the stability and assurance needed in their service.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Young Kim, R-CA, has introduced the Improving VA Training for Military Sexual Trauma Claims Act, aimed at enhancing the processing and management of military sexual trauma (MST) claims within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This legislative initiative seeks to establish clearer guidelines for training VA personnel involved in assessing these sensitive claims.

The bill comes in response to growing concerns over the handling of MST claims, where veterans often report feeling unsupported or traumatized throughout the claims process. Representative Kim emphasized the need to improve the experiences of veterans by enhancing the training of VA employees who interact with claimants. Under the proposed legislation, every employee involved in processing such claims would receive annual sensitivity training tailored to their experience level.

This legislative push is noteworthy given the alarming statistics surrounding MST within the military community. Reports indicate that a significant number of service members experience sexual trauma, and many face challenges when seeking help through the VA. The proposed legislation aims to address these shortcomings by ensuring that VA employees are equipped to handle these claims with the necessary care and understanding.

Additionally, the act requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide regular updates on training practices and improvements, thereby fostering a culture of accountability within the VA. By mandating a comprehensive report detailing current training methods and future plans for enhancement, the bill promises to hold the VA to a higher standard in its treatment of MST claims.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2204",40434,"Rep. Langworthy Introduces Higher Education Accountability Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicholas A. Langworthy, R-NY, has introduced a new bill aimed at enforcing accountability among institutions of higher education regarding foreign terrorist organizations. The proposed legislation mandates that universities report any incidents where students on nonimmigrant visas (F-1 or J-1) endorse or support such organizations to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns about national security and the potential for foreign influences within U.S. educational institutions. Supporters argue that quicker notification and action can help safeguard American interests and maintain the integrity of educational environments. By requiring immediate reporting, the bill seeks to enhance monitoring of students who may represent security risks.

Should a university identify a student engaged in supportive activities for a designated foreign terrorist organization, the Secretary of State would have the authority to revoke their visa. This process would be followed by immigration enforcement actions initiated by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The bill specifies that the term foreign terrorist organization refers to those designated by existing U.S. Congress law.

This legislation is indicative of a wider trend emphasizing the importance of national security within the immigration framework, particularly as it relates to education. As institutions of higher learning grapple with the legitimacy of their student bodies, this action may catalyze more stringent screening procedures.

Introduced on March 18, 2025, the bill has been referred to both the Judiciary and Education and Workforce Committees, where its provisions will be further evaluated. As debates on national security and education reform evolve, the fate of this bill reflects ongoing tensions in balancing security measures with the principles of academic freedom.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, has introduced the Prevent Homelessness Act, a groundbreaking legislation aimed at establishing a Housing Stabilization Fund designed to provide emergency housing assistance specifically for extremely low-income renters and homeowners. The bill was introduced on March 18, 2025, and is currently pending review by the House Committee on Financial Services.

This proposal arises from mounting concerns over the increasing rates of homelessness across the United States, significantly affecting vulnerable populations. With the ongoing economic challenges exacerbating housing insecurity, the Prevent Homelessness Act aims to mitigate these issues by creating a structured fund that can respond swiftly to the needs of families in distress.

The act will ensure that financial assistance is readily available for housing-related obligations, including rent, utility bills, and even necessary repairs to make homes habitable. By coordinating with local programs, the legislation seeks to streamline access to resources and improve outcomes for families facing financial hardships due to unexpected situations such as health crises or job loss. 

Every year, the fund intends to allocate $100 million from federal resources, with a focus on helping families identified as extremely low-income and facing imminent risks of eviction or other housing issues. This comprehensive approach addresses not only immediate needs but also emphasizes supportive services, like legal assistance and counseling, to help families maintain stable housing in the long-term.

The Prevent Homelessness Act represents a concerted effort by lawmakers to tackle the multifaceted problem of homelessness through preventive measures, reflecting a commitment to safeguard the most vulnerable members of society.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-CA, has introduced the Saving NASA’s Workforce Act, aimed at placing a moratorium on any reduction in force at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) until full-year appropriations for fiscal year 2026 are secured. This bill is designed to protect NASA employees from involuntary layoffs amid ongoing budget uncertainties.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-CA, has introduced the Saving NOAA’s Workforce Act, aimed at instituting a moratorium on workforce reductions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This crucial legislation seeks to protect the jobs of NOAA employees by prohibiting any involuntary separations until after full-year appropriations for fiscal year 2026 are legally enacted.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns about potential workforce cuts at NOAA, which plays a vital role in climate research, weather forecasting, and habitat protection. By preventing layoffs, Lofgren’s legislation aims to maintain NOAA’s essential functions amid ongoing budgetary challenges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-PA, has introduced the DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program and Law Enforcement Support Act, which aims to streamline and enhance the operational capacity of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This legislation seeks to establish a new Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program designed for analysts within DHS, enabling them to gain valuable insights and experience through rotational assignments across various intelligence components.

The introduction of this bill comes in a context where the need for improved information-sharing and collaboration among different components of national security has become increasingly apparent. As threats evolve, adapting the workforce is crucial for the DHS to maintain its effectiveness in safeguarding the nation. By allowing intelligence analysts to rotate through different roles, the program intends to cultivate a more adaptable and knowledgeable workforce capable of responding to dynamic challenges.

The potential impact of the bill extends beyond just personnel mobility. If enacted, it would contribute to a more robust intelligence-gathering framework that leverages diverse experiences and perspectives, potentially leading to more effective threat assessments and responses. The program would also encourage professional development, fostering a culture of continuous learning within DHS.

Background on the bill reveals a growing recognition of the importance of intelligence in national security. In recent years, there have been calls for reforming and modernizing how intelligence is handled across various agencies to address gaps in responsiveness and coordination. This bill stands as a response to those calls, establishing a structured pathway for professional growth while ultimately aiming to enhance the overall security landscape of the United States. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Homeland Security for further deliberation.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2214",40434,"Rep. Miller-Meeks Introduces DRUG Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-IA, has introduced the Delinking Revenue from Unfair Gouging Act (DRUG Act) aimed at reforming pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in the United States. This legislation seeks to curb unfair practices that lead to excessive costs for prescription drugs, ensuring that PBMs do not derive additional revenue from drug pricing schemes.

The introduction of the DRUG Act comes amidst growing concerns over rising healthcare costs and the opaque nature of pharmacy benefit management. PBMs play a pivotal role in negotiating drug prices on behalf of insurance plans but have come under scrutiny for their lack of transparency and financial incentives that may lead to higher drug prices for consumers. The new bill intends to establish strict guidelines prohibiting PBMs from receiving compensation based on the prices of prescription drugs or based on discounts and rebates linked to drug procurement.

If passed, the DRUG Act would significantly transform how PBMs operate by strictly regulating their remuneration practices. Starting in 2027, PBMs would only be allowed to charge a specified fee for services that must be defined in a contractual agreement—eliminating any profit motives tied to drug pricing. Violations of these provisions could result in substantial civil penalties against PBMs.

The potential impact of the DRUG Act extends beyond financial implications; it could also enhance patient outcomes by fostering a more competitive and transparent landscape in the prescription drug market. By ensuring that the costs of prescription drugs do not unjustly enrich PBMs, the legislation aims to lower overall healthcare costs and improve access to necessary medications for patients across the nation. With bipartisan support indicated during its introduction, the DRUG Act could gain further traction in Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Seth Moulton, D-MA, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at redesignating the Salem Maritime National Historic Site as Salem Maritime National Historical Park. This bill also mandates a comprehensive boundary study to assess the inclusion of additional maritime and historical resources into the National Park System.

The purpose of this bill stems from a growing recognition of Salem's rich maritime history and its role in American coastal defenses and military heritage. By redesignating the site, the bill seeks to enhance public awareness and appreciation for the area's historical significance, which dates back to the early days of American maritime trade. 

The proposed boundary study will evaluate potential sites and resources tied to the region's maritime history, including those connected to the National Guard and local militia activities. This step not only aims to preserve and celebrate local history but also to enhance visitor experience at the park, potentially increasing tourism and related economic benefits for the local community.

Historically, the Salem Maritime National Historic Site has been a vital educational resource, showcasing the city's pivotal role in America's seafaring past. As a national park, it is expected that the area would receive heightened protection and funding, ensuring the preservation of its rich legacy for future generations.

By submitting this bill, Rep. Moulton underscores a commitment to preserving cultural heritage while promoting the economic advantages of historical tourism. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration as it moves forward through the legislative process.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. James C. Moylan, R-GU, has introduced a bill aimed at amending Title 49 of the United States Code to exempt Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands from specific eligibility requirements related to essential air service. The proposed legislation seeks to ensure that these territories continue to receive necessary air transportation services.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns about air service accessibility in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, particularly as these regions face unique geographical and economic challenges. Currently, many air carriers struggle to meet the stringent federal guidelines, often leaving residents and businesses vulnerable to service gaps. With this proposed change, Moylan believes that it will enhance the reliability and availability of air travel for residents and visitors alike.

Beyond logistics, the legislation is expected to bolster economic conditions by facilitating tourism and trade, crucial sectors for both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. As air connectivity remains a vital lifeline for these islands, easing the eligibility requirements can attract more airlines to operate in the region, ultimately contributing to local economies.

Moylan’s bill highlights an awareness of the federal government's responsibility to accommodate the specific needs of its territories, recognizing that territories like Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands often face distinct hurdles when it comes to transportation services.

As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, it has garnered attention from stakeholders who advocate for improved air service. The outcome will depend on bipartisan support, reflecting the importance of air travel to the communities in these territories. The legislation is a critical step toward ensuring that residents and businesses have consistent access to essential air transport.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2218",40434,"Rep. Nehls Introduces Stop CARB Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Troy Nehls, R-TX, has introduced the Stop California from Advancing Regulatory Burden Act of 2025, also known as the Stop CARB Act, aiming to repeal California's authority to enforce stricter vehicle emissions standards. The legislation seeks to amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate California's waivers that allow it to set more rigorous pollution controls than federal standards, specifically impacting new motor vehicle and engine emissions.

The introduction of the bill reflects growing concerns among conservative lawmakers about what they perceive as overreach by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Proponents argue that California's regulations significantly burden manufacturers and limit consumer choices, potentially leading to higher vehicle prices and reduced availability of certain models. By restricting state-level emissions standards, the bill aims to create a unified federal benchmark, simplifying compliance for automotive manufacturers nationwide.

If enacted, the legislation could reverberate through the auto industry, particularly affecting car sales and production in states that have previously adopted California’s regulations. As environmental issues become increasingly contentious, the bill signals a shift towards prioritizing economic considerations over stringent environmental policies favored by many progressive lawmakers and environmental advocates.

The move comes at a time when emissions regulations remain a hot-button issue in the debate surrounding climate change and sustainability. While supporters of the Stop CARB Act see it as necessary to curb regulatory burden, opponents argue that it undermines efforts to combat air pollution and protect public health. As the bill is referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee for review, conversations surrounding emissions standards and governmental authority are anticipated to intensify in Congress and across the country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the Salary History Question Prohibition Act, aimed at amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to prohibit employers from inquiring about the salary and benefit history of prospective employees. This bill seeks to promote pay equity by disallowing salary history as a determining factor in hiring and compensation decisions.

The introduction of this legislation follows a broader nationwide movement advocating for transparency and fairness in wage practices. Advocates note that salary histories can perpetuate existing wage disparities, particularly affecting women and individuals from minority backgrounds. By making it unlawful for employers to consider previous salaries, the bill endeavors to create a more equitable hiring process.

The proposed measure includes several key provisions. It restricts employers from seeking wage history prior to making a job offer and necessitates that any salary reduction request must come from the candidate voluntarily and only after a compensation offer is extended. The bill also stipulates penalties for employers who violate these guidelines, with civil penalties starting at $5,000 for first offenses and increasing for repeat violations.

By promoting wage transparency, the Salary History Question Prohibition Act positions itself as a proactive approach to dismantling wage discrimination practices prevalent in today’s labor market. If passed, it could have a significant impact on employment practices, fostering an environment where salaries are set based on merit and qualifications rather than historical compensation data. Norton’s initiative represents a critical step towards ensuring that all individuals are evaluated fairly when seeking employment, regardless of their past earnings.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-WA, has introduced the Preserve Access to Rapid Ambulance Emergency Medical Treatment Act of 2025 (PARA-EMT Act), aimed at addressing a critical shortage of emergency medical services (EMS) personnel across the United States. The bill seeks to support recruitment, training, and retention of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics to enhance the nation's emergency response capabilities.

The PARA-EMT Act responds to a pressing workforce crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. With an estimated 42,000 additional EMTs and paramedics needed by 2030, according to a 2019 report from the Health Resources and Services Administration, the bill aims to provide targeted support for recruiting and training initiatives. Surveys indicate that turnover rates among EMTs and paramedics range from 20% to 30% annually, leading to increasing strain on the existing workforce.

Under the provisions of this legislation, eligible EMS agencies will be able to apply for grants to implement programs that focus on recruitment and training, including technological education methods. A significant aspect of the bill is its emphasis on veteran support, facilitating the transition of veterans trained in military emergency medical service to civilian roles.

Additionally, the bill allocates funds to study and report on the ongoing workforce shortage in the EMS sector, providing Congress with essential data to address this issue effectively. Financing for the initiative includes a proposed allocation of $50 million annually for grants from 2026 to 2030, signifying a concerted federal effort to strengthen the EMS workforce.

As communities increasingly face the challenges of responding to medical emergencies, the PARA-EMT Act represents a vital step toward ensuring that quality emergency medical care remains accessible to all Americans.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Randall, D-WA, has introduced the Office of Management and Budget Inspector General Act, aimed at creating an Inspector General position specifically for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This legislative move seeks to enhance oversight and accountability within the OMB by establishing a dedicated office to investigate and police its operations.

The introduction comes in the wake of growing concerns over the management of federal funds and the effective spending by government agencies. By having an Inspector General devoted to the OMB, the legislation intends to improve transparency in federal budgeting processes, particularly as the nation grapples with significant fiscal challenges.

This initiative aligns with broader government reform efforts to restore public trust and ensure taxpayer dollars are utilized efficiently. The bill stipulates that the President must appoint an Inspector General within 120 days of the law's enactment, ensuring timely oversight for the agency responsible for developing the Federal budget and assessing its implementation.

In light of previous incidents of waste, fraud, and mismanagement within federal financial operations, advocates for the bill believe that the establishment of this office will play a crucial role in identifying issues before they escalate. The act’s proponents emphasize that proactive oversight can prevent costly mistakes and bolster the effectiveness of federal expenditure.

This measure has attracted attention within Congress, with several co-sponsors joining Rep. Randall, reflecting a bipartisan acknowledgment of the need for increased scrutiny on federal fiscal practices. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it is expected to draw debate over its potential impacts on the balancing of budgetary priorities and the overarching goal of enhancing governmental oversight.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2222",40434,"Rep. Riley Introduces Lowering Egg Prices Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Josh Riley, D-NY, has introduced the Lowering Egg Prices Act aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on surplus broiler hatching eggs intended for processing into liquid egg products. The legislation seeks to amend certain regulations applicable to shell eggs, allowing surplus hatching eggs to be repurposed and sold more efficiently.

The bill was proposed in response to the rising prices of eggs and growing concerns among consumers and producers about food affordability and waste. By enabling surplus broiler hatching eggs to be sold to egg breakers without adhering to rigid shell egg regulations, the legislation aims to enhance profitability for poultry producers and lower costs for consumers. The changes are particularly crucial in light of the broader economic pressures impacting the food supply chain.

If passed, the act would exempt surplus broiler hatching eggs from a specific federal regulation that currently restricts their processing conditions. Within 180 days of the bill's enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to issue new rules governing the storage and sale of these eggs, potentially increasing their viability for commercial use.

This legislation is also part of a broader strategy to tackle food waste, as an estimated 10% of the U.S. egg supply goes unused due to regulatory constraints. Supporters of the bill argue that by allowing surplus eggs to be processed, it can help mitigate losses while bolstering the availability of affordable egg products in the market.

Riley's bill, co-sponsored by several members from both parties, is currently referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further deliberation. The proposed changes represent a significant shift in regulatory framework intended to enhance food accessibility and reduce costs for consumers across the country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-OR, has introduced the Building Capacity for Care Act, aimed at enhancing mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities across the United States. The proposed legislation authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide loans, loan guarantees, and grants for the construction and renovation of these vital facilities.

The urgent need for expanded mental health resources has been exacerbated by rising rates of mental illnesses and substance use disorders in communities nationwide. By facilitating the development of more treatment centers, this bill seeks to alleviate the burden on existing facilities, which often struggle to meet local demand. It focuses on increasing the availability of pediatric and adult inpatient services, particularly in rural and underserved areas where resources are critically lacking.

Through targeted funding, the legislation also aims to improve digital infrastructure and telehealth capabilities in treatment facilities. The intention is to create a more robust and accessible care framework, making it easier for patients to seek and receive help from licensed professionals. By prioritizing projects in areas with high needs, the act positions itself as a proactive measure to combat the growing mental health crisis.

Additionally, the Building Capacity for Care Act plans to allocate federal funds, totaling up to $200 million annually through fiscal years 2025 to 2029, to ensure the effective implementation of these projects.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2224",40434,"Rep. Schakowsky Introduces Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-IL, has introduced the Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act, aimed at revising federal tax legislation to classify tar sands products as crude oil for taxation purposes. This change is designed to close existing loopholes that allow for preferential tax treatment of tar sands oil, which critics argue undercuts efforts to address climate change.

This legislation was prompted by growing concerns over environmental impacts associated with tar sands extraction and processing. Environmental advocates argue that classifying tar sands oil similarly to other crude oil products would ensure a more equitable tax framework, potentially discouraging further exploitation of these resources. By applying the same tax rate, the act seeks to provide a financial incentive for transitioning towards cleaner energy sources.

The bill specifically amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the definition of crude oil to include products derived from tar sands and bituminous mixtures. The aim is to level the playing field for energy producers and promote compliance with environmental regulations that mitigate pollution risks.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, affecting both revenue generation for the federal government and the energy market. By eliminating preferential tax rates, it may encourage investment in alternative energy technologies, fostering innovation and job creation in the renewable sector.

Schakowsky’s bill has been deferred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further discussion. If passed, it reflects a broader legislative trend aimed at addressing climate change through more stringent energy taxation policies. As the effects of climate change become increasingly apparent, lawmakers are under growing pressure to implement strategies that not only generate revenue but also promote sustainability.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2225",40434,"Rep. Sherman Introduces Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Sherman, D-CA, has introduced the Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act, aimed at enhancing the financial capabilities of registered investment companies. The bill proposes to allow these companies to exclude specific fees from the calculation of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, thereby easing the financial burden on smaller investment entities and encouraging their growth.

The introduction of this legislation responds to concerns regarding the financial constraints faced by small and emerging investment firms. By permitting registered investment companies to omit certain indirect fees, the bill seeks to facilitate investment in business development companies, which play a crucial role in providing financial support to small businesses. This could potentially increase investment flows into smaller enterprises, ultimately contributing to job creation and economic development.

The Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act emphasizes the need for supportive regulatory frameworks that can help small businesses thrive in a competitive marketplace. Without such assistance, many investment firms find it challenging to navigate the existing fee structures that limit their operational flexibility. The proposed changes are likely to foster a more equitable investment climate, enabling more diverse participation in the market.

Additionally, as the financial landscape evolves, the need for regulatory adaptations to reflect current economic conditions becomes increasingly critical. This legislative initiative highlights a proactive approach to ensuring that small businesses have greater access to necessary capital and resources.

As the bill progresses through Congress, it has the potential to reshape how investment firms operate and how small businesses are funded in the future. By supporting this legislation, lawmakers signal their commitment to enhancing investment opportunities for smaller firms and the overall economy.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2226",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces Let Pregnancy Centers Serve Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the Let Pregnancy Centers Serve Act aimed at amending the Public Health Service Act. The legislation seeks to prohibit discrimination against pregnancy centers that do not participate in abortion services and enhance the enforcement of federal conscience laws.

The bill was introduced in response to ongoing debates around reproductive health services and aims to protect organizations that provide alternatives to abortion. Supporters assert that pregnancy centers play a critical role in offering health care and resources, including pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and emotional support, without advocating for abortion. In 2022, approximately 2,750 centers collectively provided over 3.25 million service sessions, showcasing their significant impact in the community.

By preventing federal and state discrimination against these centers, the legislation intends to ensure that organizations can continue to offer life-affirming services without fear of penalties or mandates requiring them to provide or promote abortion. Advocates argue that this measure is essential for preserving the freedom of conscience for health care providers while expanding support for expecting mothers.

The proposed legislative changes include specific prohibitions against requiring entities to offer abortion services, provide abortion-inducing drugs, or make referrals for abortion, which aligns with ongoing national discussions regarding reproductive rights. Should this bill pass, it would reinforce the broader landscape of reproductive health care in the United States, potentially influencing how health services are provided at both state and federal levels.

Rep. Smith's introduction of this bill marks another chapter in the complex conversation surrounding reproductive health policies, reflecting the continuing divide over abortion access and support systems available for pregnant individuals. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Greg Stanton, D-AZ, has introduced the WOLF Act of 2025, aimed at providing emergency relief to livestock producers affected by predation from Mexican gray wolves. This legislation proposes amendments to the Agricultural Act of 2014, allowing for 100% indemnity payments for livestock lost to wolf attacks.

The bill was introduced in response to increasing concerns among Arizona ranchers about the detrimental impact of Mexican gray wolves on livestock herds. Ranchers have reported significant losses due to these predators, with some estimating annual losses to be in the thousands of dollars. The proposed act not only reinforces financial support but also establishes a structured emergency relief program to mitigate the effects of wolf predation on livestock production.

By implementing this legislation, the Secretary of Agriculture will create a compensation formula that considers various factors, including herd size and historical depredation rates. This tailored approach aims to address the unique challenges faced by producers depending on their specific circumstances, ensuring equitable relief based on individual losses and management practices.

The implications of the WOLF Act are significant, as they not only provide immediate financial assistance to struggling ranchers but also recognize the complexities of wildlife management. The bill addresses the balance between conservation efforts for the endangered Mexican gray wolf and the economic viability of local livestock operations.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will likely spark discussions on balancing environmental concerns with agricultural needs. Supporters argue that proactive measures are essential for protecting ranchers and their livelihoods, while opponents may raise questions about the long-term management of wolf populations and their impact on ecosystems.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the Survivor Benefits Fairness Act, aimed at amending provisions related to compensation, dependency, and indemnity compensation for survivors of veterans. The bill seeks to adjust the effective date for certain reductions and discontinuances based on a marriage, remarriage, or death occurring after the act's enactment.

The Survivor Benefits Fairness Act was introduced in response to ongoing concerns regarding inconsistencies in the effective dates of benefit reductions for veterans' survivors. Current regulations often create confusion and financial hardship for families affected by the loss of a veteran. By changing the effective date to the last day of the month during which the event occurs, the proposed legislation aims to provide survivors with a clearer and more manageable transition period.

If passed, the bill could significantly impact how survivors navigate their financial situations during emotionally challenging times. Proponents argue that addressing these redundant bureaucratic delays will offer much-needed support and assurance for families adjusting to their new circumstances. The bill aligns with broader efforts to enhance veterans' benefits by ensuring that survivors are treated fairly and equitably in the event of such life-altering changes.

Steil, who serves on the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, emphasizes the importance of simplifying the process for survivors. The introduction of this bill highlights a commitment to ensuring that those who have sacrificed for their country receive the support they deserve even after their loved ones have passed. The Survivor Benefits Fairness Act represents a step toward rectifying systemic challenges within the veterans' benefits system, enhancing fairness and providing peace of mind to surviving family members during an already difficult transition.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the No Veteran Falls Through the Cracks Act, aimed at enhancing the process for veterans to schedule mental health care appointments through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill seeks to address barriers that veterans face in accessing critical mental health services, ensuring they receive timely care.

The introduction of this bill comes as mental health issues among veterans continue to rise, compounded by difficulties in making appointments and rescheduling cancelled visits. The legislation mandates that the VA actively reschedule appointments when veterans cancel, regardless of the cancellation method. This includes proactive outreach through telephone calls to ensure that veterans are promptly reconnected with the care they need. 

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, as it seeks to streamline appointment processes and reduce gaps in care. Enhanced communication efforts may lead to better attendance rates for mental health services, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for veterans experiencing a range of mental health challenges, from anxiety and depression to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Historically, veterans have reported difficulties navigating the VA system, contributing to increased risk of mental health decline. This legislation not only aims to provide immediate support by improving scheduling efficiency but also addresses broader systemic issues within the VA's mental health care delivery model. The proposal has been turned over to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for further discussion and evaluation.

Overall, the No Veteran Falls Through the Cracks Act represents a vital step toward ensuring that veterans receive the necessary support for their mental well-being, reflecting a growing commitment to prioritize veterans' health issues within legislative agendas.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. W. Gregory Steube, R-FL, has introduced the Independent Programmers Tax Incentive Act, aimed at providing tax credits for multichannel video programming distributors that carry independent programmers. This legislation is designed to support smaller content creators and expand diverse programming options, seeking to invigorate the competitive landscape of video distribution.

The Independent Programmers Tax Incentive Act was introduced in response to a growing concern over the viability of independent content creators in an increasingly consolidated media environment. By incentivizing multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to include independent programmers in their offerings, the bill hopes to foster a more competitive environment that encourages innovation and diversity in content.

Under the proposed measure, eligible distributors can claim tax credits based on the licensing fees paid to independent programmers. Specifically, the credit would be either the net license fees for carriage or a calculated amount based on the number of subscribers, capped to ensure fiscal sustainability. This system is expected to alleviate some financial barriers that independent programmers face, potentially increasing their market reach.

Additionally, the bill mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to report biennially on the distribution of independent programming, bolstering transparency and encouraging continued interest from distributors. This provision aims to ensure that independent programmers receive adequate attention and resources from MVPDs.

Overall, the Independent Programmers Tax Incentive Act represents a strategic effort to bolster the independent programming sector and ensure that audiences have access to a wider array of content, enriching the media landscape for consumers across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2025, aimed at ensuring continued access to ambulance services under Medicare. If passed, the bill seeks to extend coverage timelines, thus reducing potential financial burdens for patients relying on critical care during emergencies.

The legislation is introduced in response to increasing concerns regarding the accessibility and affordability of essential medical transportation. With a notable rise in healthcare costs, many Americans face difficulty affording out-of-pocket expenses associated with ambulance services. The proposed act would amend the Social Security Act to extend the coverage period for ground ambulance services through 2028. This aims to safeguard patients’ access to necessary care without crippling financial implications.

As healthcare continues to evolve, policymakers recognize the essential role that ambulance services play in emergency medical response. Recent data indicates that delays in access to such services can have dire consequences for patient outcomes. The Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act is seen as a crucial step toward addressing these pressing healthcare challenges.

The bill is positioned within a broader legislative effort to enhance the overall Medicare system, ensuring it remains responsive to the demands of an aging population and the complexities of modern health emergencies. The act highlights a bipartisan effort, with several co-sponsors from both parties, reflecting a united commitment to preserving patient access to critical medical services.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dina Titus, D-NV, has introduced the SLOT Act of 2025, a bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to increase the information reporting threshold for winnings from slot machines. This legislation proposes raising the threshold from its current level to $5,000, significantly impacting how winnings are reported and taxed.

This bill comes amid ongoing debates regarding the financial burdens placed on gamblers, with support for the legislation citing the need for modernization in tax reporting systems. Under the current law, winnings exceeding $1,200 are subject to reporting, putting a considerable strain on less affluent players who might not frequently win large sums. By elevating the threshold, the SLOT Act seeks to reduce the administrative burden on casinos and minimize confusion for casual players.

The impact of this bill could be substantial. If passed, the increased threshold would allow many slot players to enjoy their winnings without the fear of automatic tax reporting. The amendment includes provisions for annual inflation adjustments to ensure the threshold remains relevant over time, thereby providing ongoing relief to gamblers faced with changing economic conditions.

As gambling revenues grow in popularity, discussions around taxation policies become increasingly critical. The current structure often leaves small-time winners vulnerable to paperwork that could overshadow their gains. Addressing these concerns, the bill aims to balance the interests of the government with those of everyday gamers, streamlining procedures while also encouraging further participation in the gambling economy.

The SLOT Act was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means after its introduction, signaling the beginning of legislative review that could reshape the gambling landscape for millions of Americans starting in 2026.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-IL, has introduced the Ensuring Veterans Timely Access to Anesthesia Care Act to enhance anesthesia services for veterans under the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This legislation aims to update existing standards to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of anesthesia care through licensed independent practice for certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and established certification requirements for anesthesia providers.

The bill was introduced following increasing concerns about delays in accessing necessary anesthesia services for veterans, a problem exacerbated by staffing shortages and operational inefficiencies within the VHA. Currently, CRNAs are often restricted in their practice and unable to operate independently, which can lead to bottlenecks in the care process. By recognizing these professionals as independent practitioners, the proposed legislation seeks to streamline service delivery and ensure veterans receive timely care.

If passed, the act mandates that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs align VHA directives with the Defense Health Agency’s standards related to CRNAs. It requires that anesthesia providers, including both anesthesiologists and CRNAs, meet specific certification standards and complete a minimum number of hours in direct patient care. 

The potential impact of the legislation is significant, as it not only aims to enhance access to care but also addresses cost-effectiveness by promoting models that can deliver anesthesia services more efficiently. A report from the Government Accountability Office will track outcomes related to various anesthesia delivery models, ensuring that the Department of Veterans Affairs can make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

Rep. Underwood's initiative emphasizes the commitment to improving healthcare for veterans, ensuring they have timely access to necessary treatments, while also enhancing the roles of anesthesia providers in the VHA.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Habitat Connectivity on Working Lands Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at enhancing wildlife migration corridors and habitat connectivity across agricultural landscapes. Introduced on March 18, 2025, the bill seeks to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to incorporate greater support for conservation programs that facilitate the movement of native species.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns over habitat fragmentation due to agricultural practices, which can impede the movement of wildlife, particularly big game species. The proposed legislation emphasizes the importance of preserving ecological connections essential for biodiversity, particularly as urban development and agricultural expansion continue to threaten natural habitats.

The bill proposes to give priority to enhancing wildlife corridors and connectivity in existing conservation programs. Key provisions include directives for federal conservation efforts to incorporate nonstructural methods like virtual fencing to manage livestock distribution, thereby supporting habitat recovery efforts. Additionally, it aims to ensure that farmers and landowners receive necessary technical assistance to adopt these new practices effectively.

If enacted, the act could help reverse some of the detrimental impacts of land conversion on wildlife populations, fostering healthier ecosystems while allowing agricultural practices to coexist with wildlife needs. Advocates believe this bill could serve as a model for reconciling agricultural productivity with environmental stewardship, laying the groundwork for more sustainable land-use policies nationwide.

The Habitat Connectivity on Working Lands Act highlights a growing recognition among legislators of the urgent need for innovative conservation strategies that support both farmers and the vital wildlife populations that depend on connected landscapes.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Healthy Foods for Native Seniors Act, aimed at improving food access for Native American seniors through the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). This legislation proposes a demonstration project to enable tribal entities to purchase agricultural commodities directly, enhancing nutritional support for Indigenous communities.

The bill was introduced in response to the growing concern about food insecurity among Native American populations, particularly seniors who often face unique health challenges. By allowing tribes to select and procure their food supplies, this act aims to ensure that commodities meet the specific dietary and cultural needs of Native communities. The initiative is expected to empower tribal organizations to manage food distribution more effectively, fostering self-determination in food sovereignty.

Should the act be enacted, it could significantly improve the nutritional quality of food packages distributed to elderly Native Americans. Furthermore, it stipulates that purchased commodities must be domestically sourced and nutritionally comparable or superior to existing offerings under the CSFP. This provision will not only facilitate better health outcomes but also strengthen local agriculture economies by supporting U.S. farmers.

To finance these efforts, the bill requests $5 million in appropriations for its implementation. This funding will cover the costs associated with the procurement, administration of the program, and support staff needed to oversee the demonstration project over multiple fiscal years. Reports on the project's progress will be required annually to ensure transparency and effectiveness.

This legislation, introduced on March 18, 2025, has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture for further consideration. If passed, the Healthy Foods for Native Seniors Act could mark a significant step forward in addressing food insecurity in Native American populations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, introduced the Farm Workforce Support Act, aimed at evaluating the H-2A temporary visa program. This legislation seeks to assess the program's impact on hiring domestic and guest workers, alongside examining challenges faced by agricultural employers regarding housing and wages.

The bill comes in light of growing concerns about the reliance on guest workers through the H-2A program amid a labor shortage in the agricultural sector. By commissioning a report from the Comptroller General of the United States, the act intends to generate valuable insights on how the program affects both domestic workers and employers. The report will analyze the program's economic implications and compliance with working condition guarantees, thereby highlighting both its benefits and drawbacks.

In particular, the legislation examines various facets of the employment landscape, such as the challenges American employers face in retrieving adequate housing for guest workers. With the increasing wages demanded by domestic workers, the report will also investigate how these conditions affect employer recruitment efforts and the potential effects on guest workers’ families, particularly regarding lost wages.

With agriculture being a key sector in the U.S. economy, the introduction of this bill aligns with ongoing debates over immigration and labor policies. By shedding light on the functionality and ramifications of the H-2A program, the proposed legislation aims to refine existing policies that govern agricultural labor.

By addressing these issues, the Farm Workforce Support Act could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of agricultural employment in America, potentially leading to more balanced and effective worker-management relations for the agricultural industry moving forward.

The bill arises amid concerns that current regulations impede timely maintenance and improvements on grazing lands, critical to both ranchers’ livelihoods and environmental stewardship. By mandating that the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior respond within 30 days to requests for range improvements, the proposed legislation aims to enhance operational efficiency for ranchers working on federal lands.

If enacted, the Ranching Without Red Tape Act will authorize permit holders to perform minor improvements, such as enhancing fences, wells, and water pipelines, after giving appropriate notifications. This legislative action is deemed necessary as many ranchers face extensive delays due to bureaucratic processes, ultimately impacting food production and sustainability practices.

As part of a broader trend towards regulatory reform, the bill underscores a commitment to support the agricultural community while addressing the intricate balance between land management and resource optimization. Representative Vasquez articulates that by simplifying procedures, this legislation will not only assist ranchers in their daily operations but also promote healthier landscapes through timely repairs and enhancements.

The Ranching Without Red Tape Act has been referred to the House Committees on Natural Resources and Agriculture for further consideration, reflecting its comprehensive approach to facilitating ranching operations across American landscapes. The potential passage of this bill may have long-lasting effects on the ranching industry and its ability to adapt to evolving agricultural challenges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-IN, has introduced the Strengthen Wood Product Supply Chains Act, aimed at enhancing the enforcement of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. This act seeks to streamline regulations pertaining to the inspection and detention of imported wood products, ensuring fairness and transparency in the enforcement processes.

The Lacey Act has historically addressed illegal trade in wildlife, plants, and timber, but the proposal focuses specifically on modernizing enforcement practices. By establishing clearer guidelines for the detention and testing of imported wood products, the bill aims to reduce unnecessary delays and enhance compliance for importers. This legislative move comes amid growing concerns over sustainability and the need for robust supply chains that can sustain the wood industry while ensuring legal compliance.

Potential impacts of this bill include improved efficiency in handling detained goods, as well as a clearer communication framework between importers and government authorities regarding the reasons for detention. In a market where time is critical, the proposed 30-day timeframe for the resolution of detentions can significantly benefit businesses relying on timely imports.

Enhancing the legislative framework not only addresses concerns related to environmental protection but also acknowledges the importance of supporting the local wood industry amidst increasing competition and regulatory pressures. As global demand for sustainably sourced wood rises, this proactive approach could position U.S. suppliers favorably in the international market.

This bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and marks a significant step toward balancing regulatory oversight with the operational needs of the wood products industry. It reflects an understanding of the delicate equilibrium between environmental stewardship and economic vitality that is vital to the future of American manufacturing.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Moore, R-NC, has introduced the Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act, aimed at enhancing the safety and mental health of law enforcement officers. This legislation seeks to empower the Attorney General to gather comprehensive data on violent attacks against police officers, thereby informing better policy and resource allocation.

The bill comes in response to a concerning rise in violence against law enforcement, highlighted by a reported 60 officer fatalities in 2022 due to felonious acts. Additionally, nearly 30% of these deaths were attributed to unprovoked ambushes. By establishing requirements for data collection on these incidents, the act intends to provide lawmakers with a clearer picture of the threats faced by officers and the context surrounding these violent occurrences.

One significant provision of the bill mandates the Attorney General to compile detailed reports detailing the circumstances of attacks against officers, including the nature of the assaults and the effectiveness of existing training programs aimed at preventing them. The measure also addresses the mental health ramifications of these violent encounters, pushing for an evaluation of available resources and the need for increased mental health support for law enforcement personnel.

Historically, the lack of consistent data reporting on aggressive actions against officers has hampered efforts to fully understand and respond to these threats. The bill acknowledges the emotional toll such violence takes on officers, advocating for additional support mechanisms and legislative tools to enhance their well-being. 

As the bill progresses through Congress, it underscores a commitment to prioritizing the safety and mental health of law enforcement, reflecting a critical national conversation about the evolving challenges they face on the job.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA, has introduced the Secret Ballot Protection Act aimed at reinforcing workers' rights to a secret ballot election in union representation decisions. The bill seeks to amend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to ensure that employees can choose their representation without coercion or intimidation.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when labor organization elections are increasingly under scrutiny for their transparency and fairness. Proponents of the legislation argue that secret ballots are essential for protecting workers from outside pressures during unionization processes. They contend that the right to a secret ballot is vital for upholding democratic principles within the workplace, allowing employees to make decisions free from fear of repercussions.

This bill is significant for its potential impact on union representation across various industries. By mandating secret ballots for all union elections, it aims to eliminate practices where union recognition occurs through private agreements rather than transparent voting methods. This amendment is seen as a safeguard to ensure that employees have a clear, protected avenue to express their preferences regarding unionization.

Historically, the right to a secret ballot in labor relations has been a cornerstone of American labor law, recognized for over a century. The proposed changes seek to reinforce this tradition in the modern context where concerns about influence and manipulation in union elections have intensified.

The Secret Ballot Protection Act has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further discussion. If passed, it could reshape the landscape of labor representation, enhancing the rights of workers to choose their representatives in a more secure and private manner.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-TX, has introduced the Eliminating Fraud and Improper Payments in TANF Act, aimed at addressing systemic issues within the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This legislation seeks to measure and significantly reduce instances of improper payments facilitated through state block grants.

The need for this bill arises from ongoing concerns regarding transparency and accountability within TANF, a crucial program designed to assist low-income families. Reports suggest that improper payments—stemming from both fraud and administrative errors—have become increasingly common, prompting calls for reform. By establishing stricter guidelines and accountability measures, the bill aims to protect taxpayer dollars while ensuring that aid reaches those who genuinely need it. 

Specifically, the legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to draft a comprehensive plan to eliminate these improper payments within a decade. Furthermore, it requires that states adhere to the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, which mandates rigorous reporting and auditing protocols to ensure operational integrity. Such measures are not only intended to safeguard funds but also to bolster public confidence in federal assistance programs. 

With TANF's reputation at stake, this bill signifies a proactive approach to reforming social welfare policies. If passed, the act promises to enhance program efficacy while reducing wasteful expenditures. By tightening the reins on financial oversight, Rep. Arrington's initiative reflects an increasing legislative focus on accountability, aiming to forge a more robust safety net for vulnerable populations. As this bill moves through the legislative process, it stands as a critical step towards reforming TANF and ensuring that assistance effectively supports needy families.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Don Bacon, R-NE, has introduced the LEOSA Reform Act, aimed at enhancing the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act (LEOSA) to improve provisions regarding concealed firearms for law enforcement officers. This legislation is designed to address ambiguities and strengthen the rights of both active and retired officers to carry concealed firearms, especially in certain federal facilities.

The need for this bill arises from recent concerns over the limitations that existing laws impose on law enforcement personnel when accessing federal properties. By refining the definitions and expanding authorization, the bill seeks to create a clearer framework for law enforcement officials, allowing them to carry their weapons safely and legally in more environments. It reflects a growing recognition of the critical role that law enforcement plays in ensuring public safety, particularly on federal grounds.

The potential impact of the LEOSA Reform Act is significant for current and former law enforcement officers, granting them greater freedom while carrying firearms. This act intends to enhance their ability to respond to threats effectively and seamlessly, especially in high-security areas where law enforcement presence is crucial.

Additionally, the bill proposes to amend various sections of U.S. Code to streamline the training qualifications for officers wishing to carry concealed weapons, ensuring that necessary safety standards are maintained. This amendment includes provisions for qualifications established by different agencies and certified instructors, thereby recognizing the diverse backgrounds of officers across states.

Overall, the LEOSA Reform Act represents a proactive step towards safeguarding the rights and responsibilities of law enforcement personnel, reinforcing their capability to protect their communities while navigating the complexities of current firearm regulations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Don Bacon, R-NE, has introduced the Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act, designed to provide critical support for military firefighters suffering from health issues linked to their service. This legislation aims to establish presumptions of service connection for various diseases commonly associated with firefighting, simplifying the process for veterans to claim necessary healthcare benefits.

The impetus for the bill arises from the growing awareness of health risks faced by military firefighters, who often encounter hazardous materials during their service. The Act identifies specific diseases, including various forms of cancer, lung disease, and heart issues, which have been statistically linked to firefighting activities. By presumptively connecting these conditions to military service, the legislation seeks to alleviate the burden on veterans who might struggle to prove the connection in order to receive benefits.

Should the bill pass, it is expected to positively impact numerous veterans who have served in roles related to firefighting. The proposed changes would allow for swifter access to healthcare services and compensation for affected veterans, thereby enhancing their quality of life. The importance of this bill reflects a broader commitment to honoring the sacrifices made by military personnel and ensuring they receive the support they need upon returning home.

This legislation is now in the hands of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where it will undergo further scrutiny. As the bill progresses, advocates hope to rally considerable support, emphasizing the importance of this initiative for the health and well-being of those who protect others while serving their country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Don Bacon, R-NE, has introduced the Autonomy for Disabled Veterans Act, aimed at enhancing home health services for disabled veterans by increasing the financial assistance they receive for home modifications. The bill proposes to raise the thresholds for funding home improvements from $6,800 to $10,000 and for structural alterations from $2,000 to $5,000, directly addressing the unique needs of veterans with disabilities.

The impetus for introducing this legislation stems from a growing recognition of the challenges faced by disabled veterans in maintaining safe and accessible living environments. With many veterans requiring modifications to improve mobility and accessibility in their homes, the current financial limits have proven insufficient. The proposed amendments are designed to relieve some of this financial burden, allowing veterans greater independence and improving their quality of life.

If passed, the Autonomy for Disabled Veterans Act could have a substantial impact on the lives of many veterans across the country. The increased funding would not only enable them to make necessary adjustments but also facilitate a smoother transition from hospital care to home living. This is critical for ensuring that veterans can manage their daily activities comfortably, thus fostering a sense of autonomy and dignity.

Furthermore, the legislation includes a provision for annual adjustments based on inflation, ensuring that the funding remains relevant and useful over time. This step recognizes the need to keep pace with rising costs in the construction and modification sectors, further supporting veterans’ ongoing needs for home adaptations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Barr, R-KY, has introduced a new legislative measure aimed at safeguarding national security through stringent regulations on foreign investments connected to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The bill, titled Foreign Investment Guardrails to Help Thwart (FIGHT) China Act, seeks to impose sanctions, enhance scrutiny of U.S. investments in Chinese firms, and establish notification requirements for any transaction that could pose security risks.

The proposal comes amid increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly concerning technological advancements and military capabilities. By restricting investments in certain sectors that involve emerging technologies, the FIGHT China Act addresses concerns that investments could inadvertently bolster Chinese military or surveillance capabilities. This legislative push reflects a bipartisan recognition of the need to protect American investors and the broader implications for national security.

Key features of the bill include the establishment of a covered foreign person designation, which would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to impose restrictions on individuals and entities linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, it mandates reporting requirements for U.S. individuals and firms making investments in foreign enterprises involved in prohibited technologies, ensuring that such transactions undergo rigorous federal oversight.

In addition, the act aims to enhance collaboration with allied nations to combat shared security threats posed by China. It emphasizes the necessity for multilateral approaches to establish comprehensive measures against investments deemed risky. As the geopolitical landscape evolves, the outcome of this bill will be closely monitored, highlighting its potential to reshape U.S.-China economic relations and influence global investment patterns.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Burchett, R-TN, has introduced the Pilot Certificate Accessibility Act, aimed at streamlining the process for pilots to present their certification during Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspections. This legislation allows pilots to use both physical and digital copies of their certificates, enhancing accessibility and convenience in compliance with federal regulations.

The bill was crafted in response to concerns voiced by the aviation community regarding the difficulties pilots face when having to produce original paper certificates for inspections. Currently, presenting a physical certificate is mandatory, often leading to challenges in situations where pilots may not have immediate access to their documents. By permitting digital copies stored on electronic devices or cloud platforms, the bill seeks to modernize the certification process, aligning with technological advancements and the needs of the pilot community.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, especially considering the increased reliance on digital assets in various sectors. Officials expect this change to reduce delays during inspections and enhance operational efficiency within the aviation industry. As many pilots carry essential documents on electronic devices, the ability to show a digital certificate could facilitate smoother interactions with FAA inspectors.

This act is also part of an ongoing effort to improve the regulatory framework within the aviation sector, addressing the evolving needs of its workforce. The FAA is tasked with updating its regulations accordingly following the enactment of the bill, set to take effect one year after approval. 

The Pilot Certificate Accessibility Act reflects a broader initiative to embrace technology in aviation, ensuring safety while providing pilots with a more user-friendly compliance process. Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Earl L. Buddy Carter, R-GA, has introduced the SIGN Pardons Act, legislation designed to mandate that the President of the United States personally sign any pardons or reprieves. This bill aims to add a level of accountability and transparency to the pardoning process, a topic of considerable public interest given the high-profile nature of recent presidential pardons.

The motivation for introducing this bill stems from concerns regarding the potential misuse of presidential pardons, particularly in light of controversial pardons granted in previous administrations. Proponents argue that requiring the President's personal signature would ensure that each decision is made with careful consideration, fostering a system that upholds integrity and responsibility.

If enacted, the SIGN Pardons Act would codify a new standard in the federal government, shifting the dynamic of how pardons are issued. The impacts of this legislation could be significant, as it would compel the President to take partisan and politically sensitive acts of clemency seriously, likely sparking debate over the scope of executive power.

Furthermore, the legislation comes amid ongoing discussions about criminal justice reform and the fairness of the legal system. By ensuring that the authority to grant pardons is not delegated casually, supporters hope to restore public trust in government institutions that are often viewed as opaque or self-serving.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further debate. If passed, it would represent a notable shift in the procedural integrity of executive clemency, potentially altering the landscape of criminal justice in America.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Michael Cloud, R-TX, has introduced the Preserving Presidential Management Authority Act to amend federal law, granting the President greater discretion concerning collective bargaining agreements. This legislation aims to facilitate the termination or modification of existing agreements that conflict with presidential directives.

The introduction of this bill is a significant shift in governmental power dynamics, particularly as it seeks to redefine the authority of the President concerning labor agreements negotiated with federal employees. Currently, federal law under Chapter 71 allows collective bargaining agreements to remain in effect regardless of changing administrations, often complicating executive management efforts. By allowing the President to terminate or modify such agreements, the bill seeks to streamline governance and align labor agreements with executive priorities.

Proponents argue that the bill will enhance the efficiency of the executive branch, enabling timely responses to evolving policy needs. They contend that, especially in times of national urgency, it is essential for the President to have the ability to adjust agreements that may hinder swift administrative action. Opponents, however, express concern over potential misuse of this power, arguing it could undermine worker rights and lead to conflicts within the workforce.

Adding to the complexity, the legislation stipulates that any conflicting provisions will not be enforceable, thereby giving the President or agency heads the authority to decide the applicability of different directives. The implications of this bill extend beyond labor relations—it could set a precedent for how future administrations engage with federal labor laws.

As it stands, the Preserving Presidential Management Authority Act has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and awaits further discussion and analysis by lawmakers.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-WA, has introduced the National Landslide Preparedness Act Reauthorization Act of 2025, aiming to enhance the country’s capability to manage landslide hazards. This bill seeks to reauthorize and update previous legislation, originally enacted to increase preparedness for landslide events, which pose significant risks to communities across the United States.

The reauthorization comes in the wake of rising concerns over climate change and its contribution to extreme weather events, which can exacerbate landslides. This initiative is crucial as it focuses on integrating updated definitions related to atmospheric river flooding and extreme precipitation events into existing laws. By doing so, the bill seeks to enhance the understanding and management of landslide risks, especially in vulnerable regions.

Potential impacts of the bill include increased funding provisions, which will rise to $35 million, aimed at grants for landslide research and the deployment of early warning systems in high-risk areas. The reauthorization is designed to build on existing research, enabling state and local governments, along with tribal organizations and institutions of higher education, to collaborate effectively in mitigating risks associated with landslides.

Furthermore, the bill directs a national strategy to assess the risks of atmospheric river flooding events and extreme precipitation on landslide hazards, ensuring that these assessments are adequately addressed in disaster preparedness planning. With a focus on improving community resilience, the legislation emphasizes the need for a comprehensive hazard database and encourages the establishment of regional partnerships that can leverage local expertise for better hazard assessment and response.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, aiming to amend federal law to prohibit discrimination in abortion based on a diagnosis of Down syndrome. This bill seeks to reinforce protections for unborn children against being aborted solely for having this chromosomal disorder.

The impetus behind the legislation stems from alarming statistics indicating a significant number of abortions worldwide are performed after a Down syndrome diagnosis. The proposed bill argues that individuals with Down syndrome contribute positively to society and that discrimination against them is unacceptable. It seeks to ensure that women are informed of the legal stipulations regarding their pregnancies and Down syndrome diagnosis before proceeding with abortions.

The act outlines that it would be illegal for healthcare providers to conduct abortions based on a diagnosis of Down syndrome or knowledge that an unborn child may have it. Violators could face criminal charges along with civil penalties, including the possibility of lawsuits from affected parties. The movement toward this legislative action follows the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which fundamentally altered the landscape of abortion laws across the country.

By establishing these policies, the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act aims to emphasize the inherent value of all lives, particularly those with disabilities. It reflects a growing sentiment among advocates and some legislators who believe in protecting the rights and dignities of individuals with disabilities, supporting a nationwide dialogue on discrimination, and enhancing civil rights protections for this vulnerable population.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-ND, has announced the introduction of the North Dakota Trust Lands Completion Act, a legislative measure aimed at restoring land and mineral rights to Indian tribes within North Dakota. This initiative seeks to address longstanding issues regarding land ownership and use, enabling better management and utilization of resources by tribal authorities.

The bill was introduced on March 21, 2025, and is designed to authorize the relinquishment and selection of state-owned lands for federal lands of equivalent value. The rationale behind this legislation is to enhance economic opportunities for tribes and to rectify historical injustices related to land management within the state. It enables the state to select unappropriated federal lands in exchange for relinquishing state lands that fall within tribal reservations.

The potential impact of the North Dakota Trust Lands Completion Act is significant, as it stands to streamline the process of land conveyance and foster collaborative management between the state and tribal entities. By transferring control over these lands, the legislation not only aims to improve economic prospects for Indigenous communities but also encourages environmental stewardship and responsible resource management.

"$H billintroh-250321-hr2253",40434,"Rep. Fitzpatrick Introduces Puppy Protection Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced the Puppy Protection Act, a significant legislative measure aimed at enhancing the welfare and humane treatment of dogs within commercial breeding facilities. The bill seeks to amend the Animal Welfare Act to establish stricter standards for the care, housing, and socialization of dogs bred for sale, emphasizing the necessity for humane practices in this sector.

Fitzpatrick's proposal comes in response to longstanding concerns regarding the treatment of dogs in puppy mills, which have been criticized for overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Under the proposed legislation, dealers would be mandated to provide adequate housing, regular veterinary care, and improved social interactions for dogs. Specifically, the bill stipulates space requirements for enclosures based on the size of the dog, indoor and outdoor exercise areas, and nutritional standards for feeding dogs.

The Puppy Protection Act will also address breeding practices by prohibiting the breeding of dogs under certain age and health conditions, ensuring that breeding is conducted in a manner that prioritizes the health and welfare of both the mother and her offspring. Furthermore, it provides for the humane placement of retired breeding dogs to prevent them from being sold at auction or transferred to another breeder.

The potential impact of this legislation could be substantial, as it not only aims to alleviate current welfare issues but also promotes responsible breeding and ownership. Supporters argue that the standards set forth in the Puppy Protection Act could improve the overall quality of life for thousands of dogs across the nation. As the bill progresses through Congress, advocates are hopeful for widespread support to bring about lasting change for canine welfare.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2150",40434,"Rep. Neguse Introduces TRACE Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joe Neguse, D-CO, has introduced the TRACE Act, a piece of legislation aimed at improving how missing persons cases are recorded and tracked, particularly in relation to federal lands. This bill seeks to add a crucial data field to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, allowing authorities to specify whether the last known location of a missing person was confirmed or suspected to be on federal land.

This legislative move comes in response to growing concerns about the challenges faced by law enforcement and search and rescue teams when dealing with cases that occur in remote federal areas. By enhancing record-keeping, the TRACE Act aims to facilitate better coordination between various federal agencies and local authorities. This could potentially lead to more effective searches and quicker resolutions in missing persons cases.

The introduction of the TRACE Act highlights the increasing urgency to address the complexities surrounding disappearances on federal property, which often complicate search efforts due to jurisdictional ambiguities. The bill not only proposes the inclusion of specific details about the location of these incidents but also mandates that the Attorney General submit annual reports to Congress. This transparency will provide valuable insights into trends and patterns associated with missing persons cases on federal lands.

As federal lands often encompass vast and challenging terrains, the TRACE Act is expected to enhance public safety and support ongoing efforts to locate missing individuals in a more organized and effective manner. If passed, this legislation could significantly advance search efforts and the reporting processes for missing persons across the United States, showcasing a legislative commitment to advancing public safety and community engagement in these critical matters.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Donald Norcross, D-NJ, has introduced the Seizure Awareness and Preparedness Act aimed at enhancing support for students with epilepsy or seizure disorders in schools. This legislation seeks to establish a grant program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which would facilitate training for educators and school personnel on how to effectively address the needs of these students.

The bill was introduced in response to the growing recognition of the challenges faced by students with epilepsy, which can include seizures occurring during school hours and the necessity for specialized care. With an estimated 3 million Americans affected by epilepsy, awareness and preparedness are critical in ensuring these individuals receive appropriate treatment and support in educational settings. The act will not only empower schools but also promote education around seizure recognition and management.

The proposed program would provide competitive grants to states, allowing them to subgrant funds to local educational agencies. This funding would be designated for training school staff on creating individualized health care plans and responding appropriately to seizure-related incidents. It also allows for the hiring of compliance personnel to maintain training standards over time. By training educators and staff, the act aims to foster a safe environment for students with epilepsy, facilitating their participation in school activities and enhancing their overall educational experience.

Furthermore, the bill outlines specific provisions for including detailed medical information in individualized health care plans, ensuring that students receive tailored support. The Seizure Awareness and Preparedness Act is seen as a vital step toward improving outcomes for students living with epilepsy, enabling them to thrive academically and socially in school environments. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zachary Nunn, R-IA, has introduced the AI PLAN Act aimed at addressing economic and national security risks associated with the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial crimes. This legislation seeks to create a comprehensive strategy for combatting fraud and misinformation enabled by AI technologies.

The AI PLAN Act responds to the urgent need for a proactive approach as the proliferation of AI technologies has led to new vulnerabilities in the financial sector. With rising incidents of deepfakes, voice cloning, and synthetic identities, the legislation recognizes the potential for adversarial actors to exploit these tools for financial gain. It mandates the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Commerce to submit annual reports, detailing policies, resources, and recommendations for defensive measures against AI-driven financial crimes.

Key outcomes of the proposed strategy include the identification of technologies that can be mobilized swiftly to counteract AI-enabled fraud. The report will also outline necessary resources and identify best practices to aid businesses and governmental agencies in mitigating risks, thus enhancing overall security. 

In a backdrop of increasing global digital fraud and threats such as foreign election interference, the AI PLAN Act embodies a commitment to safeguard U.S. financial markets against emerging digital threats. As the technological landscape continues to evolve, this initiative underscores the importance of adapting legislative frameworks to protect economic integrity and national security in the face of sophisticated AI capabilities.

The introduction of the AI PLAN Act reflects a collaborative effort among federal agencies to ensure readiness against the evolving challenges posed by artificial intelligence, aiming to create a safer economic environment for consumers and businesses alike.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2153",40434,"Rep. Nunn Introduces Fight for Families Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zachary Nunn, R-IA, has introduced the Fight for Families Act, a new legislative proposal aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to make the tax credit for the adoption of special needs children refundable. The bill responds to the growing awareness of the financial burdens faced by families adopting children with special needs and seeks to provide essential financial relief.

The Fight for Families Act is primarily focused on making adoption more financially accessible for families by allowing them to receive a refund on unutilized adoption credits. Currently, many families are unable to benefit fully from these credits due to their non-refundable nature, which often results in a loss of financial support for eligible expenses related to adopting special needs children. By ensuring that a portion of the adoption credit can be refunded, the bill aims to alleviate this burden.

The legislation reflects a broader commitment to support families and enhance child welfare initiatives in the U.S. Proponents argue that making adoption more affordable is crucial both for children in foster care waiting to be adopted and for the families considering these life-changing decisions. In many cases, potential adoptive parents face significant out-of-pocket costs that can deter them from proceeding with adoptions.

The introduction of this bill comes as part of a nationwide conversation about improving support for families, particularly those welcoming children with special needs into their homes. It aims to ensure that financial assistance keeps pace with the realities of adoption, promoting a more inclusive and supportive environment for families who strive to provide loving homes for vulnerable children. The Fight for Families Act has now been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-CA, has introduced the American Cybersecurity Literacy Act, aimed at enhancing cybersecurity awareness among the public. The bill seeks to establish a national campaign to educate citizens about best practices for protecting themselves against cyber threats and reducing overall cybersecurity risks.

The initiative comes in response to the growing number of cyberattacks targeting individuals and institutions alike, underscoring the urgent need for improved public education on cybersecurity measures. By promoting literacy in this field, the legislation hopes to empower individuals with the knowledge to identify potential threats, such as phishing scams and insecure websites, and to utilize protective tools like multi-factor authentication and updated antivirus software.

If enacted, the campaign will be designed to reach a diverse audience, offering materials in multiple languages and formats. The program’s goals include educating people on recognizing various cyber risks associated with devices in their households, from smartphones and tablets to smart home appliances and internet-connected cameras.

The proposed legislation aims to not only increase public knowledge but also inspire proactive measures to mitigate risks, such as changing default passwords and regularly reviewing the permissions of mobile applications. With the rapid expansion of technology and the increasing interconnectedness of devices, this legislative effort responds to a crucial aspect of national security and economic interests.

The American Cybersecurity Literacy Act has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Ogles, R-TN, has introduced the Saving Privacy Act, a legislative effort aimed at amending the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to strengthen safeguards around personal financial information. The bill seeks to enhance confidentiality by shielding consumers' financial records from unauthorized access and establishing stringent warrant requirements for governmental entities.

The introduction of the Saving Privacy Act comes amid growing concerns over privacy violations in the digital age, where financial data is increasingly at risk from both governmental and corporate entities. Ogles emphasizes the need for robust protections, highlighting the necessity of ensuring that citizens maintain control over their financial information without unnecessary intrusion.

The proposed legislation would reform various aspects of current banking privacy regulations, including the termination of the Consolidated Audit Trail, which critics argue facilitates the collection of excessive personal data. Moreover, Ogles’ bill would prevent the issuance of central bank digital currencies directly to individuals, addressing fears about government overreach into personal finances.

In addition to these reforms, the act introduces new penalties for violations involving the unauthorized retrieval and sharing of financial data. By imposing penalties on financial institutions and government officials who breach privacy standards, the legislation aims to create a stronger incentive to protect personal information.

The bill has been referred to multiple House committees, including Financial Services and Judiciary, where it will undergo detailed examination and potential amendments. If enacted, the Saving Privacy Act could serve as a pivotal measure in advancing consumer rights in an increasingly interconnected financial landscape, ensuring that individuals are more empowered to safeguard their personal information against unwarranted access.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-CA, has introduced the Fair Access to Agriculture Disaster Programs Act, which aims to amend the Food Security Act of 1985. This legislation seeks to create an exception to existing payment limitations for individuals or legal entities deriving significant income from agricultural activities.

The bill is a response to the ongoing challenges faced by farmers and ranchers who experience hardships due to natural disasters. Without access to necessary disaster relief programs, many agricultural workers find themselves vulnerable in times of crisis. The proposed legislation will allow those whose average adjusted gross income from farming is over 75% to receive vital benefits without being hampered by existing payment caps.

The Fair Access to Agriculture Disaster Programs Act is expected to have a significant impact on agricultural communities, facilitating a more adequate safety net for farmers facing unforeseen circumstances like droughts, fires, or floods. The bill specifically targets those engaged in diverse agricultural sectors, including agri-tourism and direct-to-consumer marketing, thus broadening the pool of beneficiaries who can access disaster relief.

Historically, agricultural programs have often had limitations that disproportionately affect smaller farmers who struggle to meet certain income thresholds. By allowing greater flexibility in defining eligibility for disaster assistance, the bill aims to ensure that those hardest hit by natural disasters can continue to operate and maintain their livelihoods.

The legislation, which has garnered bipartisan support from several co-sponsors, represents a crucial step towards improving resilience in the agricultural sector. Rep. Panetta’s ongoing advocacy reflects a broader commitment to strengthening food security and supporting American farmers during challenging times. The bill has been referred to the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit for further discussion.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-CA, has introduced a new bill aimed at providing tax benefits to members of the Armed Forces stationed in Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad. The proposed legislation seeks to classify these locations as qualified hazardous duty areas, extending the same tax advantages currently available to military personnel serving in recognized combat zones.

The motivation behind this bill stems from the growing risks faced by U.S. military personnel deployed in these regions. As incidents of violence and instability increase, the bill aims to acknowledge the hazardous conditions under which these service members operate, equipping them with similar tax relief granted to those in traditional combat zones. The bill emphasizes fairness and recognition for the sacrifices made by troops in lesser-known theaters of operations.

If enacted, the legislation would allow these service members to access various tax benefits, including exemptions on combat pay and deferments on pending tax obligations, akin to those eligible for service in Iraq or Afghanistan. This adjustment could significantly enhance the financial security of thousands of military families, alleviating the tax burden during their service overseas.

The need for these provisions is further underscored by the shift in U.S. military engagements globally. As operations evolve, recognizing and adapting the associated risks ensures that all service members receive equitable treatment in terms of fiscal policy. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for consideration, where its potential impact on military personnel and their families will be further scrutinized and discussed. 

In an era where military deployments are increasingly complex, this legislation highlights the government's commitment to support those who serve in perilous environments, reinforcing the principle that all military service should be honored and respected.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, has introduced the Countering Transnational Repression Act, aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) ability to assess and respond to threats posed by foreign governments targeting individuals in the United States. The legislative proposal seeks to establish a dedicated working group within DHS to analyze and monitor instances of transnational repression and related terrorism threats.

The initiative comes amid growing concerns regarding foreign agents employing tactics like intimidation, harassment, and physical threats to coerce individuals, particularly those with dissenting views. These threats are recognized as increasingly significant risks to both domestic security and individual rights, prompting the need for proactive governmental measures.

The proposed working group will coordinate with existing intelligence and security agencies to compile data, conduct assessments, and share intelligence about transnational repression. It aims to integrate information from federal, state, local, and tribal partners to ensure comprehensive monitoring of these threats. Annual reports to Congress will detail incidents of transnational repression, including quantitative analyses and evaluations of governmental responses.

This bill highlights a bipartisan acknowledgment of the escalating dangers posed by hostile foreign governments operating within U.S. borders. By formally establishing the working group, the Act is positioned to fortify the legal and procedural frameworks necessary for safeguarding individuals from targeted actions taken by foreign agents. Additionally, it seeks to balance national security imperatives with adherence to constitutional protections, particularly regarding free speech rights.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, its proponents argue that the establishment of a Transnational Repression Working Group will empower homeland security efforts and better protect the rights of individuals in a complex global landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, introduced the Count the Crimes to Cut Act of 2025, which aims to enhance transparency in federal criminal offenses. The proposed legislation seeks to require the Attorney General to submit a detailed report on federal criminal statutes and regulatory offenses, including prosecution statistics and penalties, within a year of enactment.

The bill's introduction stems from ongoing concerns about overcriminalization in the United States, where numerous federal regulations carry criminal penalties but lack public awareness. By compiling and indexing this information, the legislation intends to inform lawmakers and the public about the breadth of criminal laws currently in effect, ultimately leading to potential reforms aimed at reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens.

In its current form, the bill mandates comprehensive reporting from various federal agencies, including their criminal regulatory offenses and the historical prosecution counts over the last 15 years. This initiative seeks to promote accountability and comprehensive understanding of how criminal statutes are enforced. It emphasizes the importance of what is known as mens rea, or the intent required to prove a crime, to be clearly articulated for each offense covered in the reports.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it could influence policy changes and reductions in overreach from federal regulations. Advocates argue that reducing such overcriminalization may help alleviate the burden on the judicial system and empower individuals and businesses to operate with clearer guidelines.

Roy's proposal reflects a growing bipartisan interest in criminal justice reform, underscoring the necessity for lawmakers to evaluate and streamline the existing framework of criminal regulations in America.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-IL, has introduced the Tools Tax Deduction Act aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to enable employees in certain sectors to deduct expenses related to their work tools and protective gear from their taxable income. This bill is part of a broader initiative to support workers who incur costs for necessary equipment that enhances their job performance.

The legislation comes at a time when many workers, particularly in the construction and trades industries, face rising costs associated with personal protective equipment and specialized tools needed for their jobs. By allowing these expenses to be deducted, the Tools Tax Deduction Act seeks to alleviate some financial burdens that employees encounter, ultimately boosting productivity and safety in the workplace.

Specifically, the bill proposes to eliminate limitations on deductions for expenses related to a trade or business performed as an employee, which could include construction tools, safety clothing, and other necessary job-related expenses. This approach is designed to support workers who might otherwise find themselves financially strained by the costs linked to their employment.

In addition to offering potential tax relief, the proposed legislation aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress concerning employee rights and fair compensation. Proponents argue that such measures are essential in ensuring that employees are not out-of-pocket for costs directly tied to their professional responsibilities.

As the Tools Tax Deduction Act moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means for review, it will be pivotal to assess its implications on tax laws and the wider impact on the workforce. Should it pass, this initiative could set a precedent for similar legislation that prioritizes the financial well-being of working Americans across various sectors.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eric Burlison, R-MO, has introduced the Paycheck Protection Act, a bill that aims to amend title 5 of the United States Code by prohibiting federal agencies from deducting labor organization dues from the pay of federal employees. This legislative proposal is situated within a broader context of debates over labor practices and employee autonomy in the public sector.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions regarding the influence of labor unions in federal workplaces. Proponents of the Paycheck Protection Act argue that it will restore financial freedom to workers by allowing them to make independent choices about political contributions and union involvement. They assert that deducting union dues from paychecks can unfairly compel employees to support organizations with which they may not agree.

The Act could significantly impact labor organizations, particularly those heavily reliant on dues as a source of funding. If passed, the bill is expected to diminish the financial resources available to these organizations, potentially limiting their effectiveness in representing employees’ interests. This aspect has raised concerns among union leaders who argue that such restrictions undermine collective bargaining processes.

The Paycheck Protection Act has already been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will undergo a review process. Supporters of the legislation believe that it aligns with a growing trend of prioritizing individual employee rights across the country, sparking a nationwide dialogue about the role of labor unions in the public sector.

This bill aims to commemorate Lopez’s distinguished military service and contributions to the community.

The introduction of this bill reflects a growing recognition of the importance of honoring local heroes and leaders within their communities. Brigadier General Lopez is a notable figure, having served in the military with distinction, contributing to both national defense and local initiatives. The establishment of a postal facility in his name seeks to inspire future generations and instill pride among residents in Santa Barbara.

By naming the post office after Lopez, the bill serves not only as a tribute to his service but also enhances the public's awareness of the sacrifices made by military personnel. The proposed designation is expected to foster a sense of unity and pride among local residents, as such acknowledgments underscore the impact of military service on community life.

This legislative effort is part of a broader initiative to recognize military personnel who have made significant contributions to society. With the bill now referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, it will undergo further deliberation. If successful, the post office will serve as a permanent reminder of Brigadier General Lopez's legacy and the values of service and community involvement he represents.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ed Case, D-HI, has introduced the Saving NEMO Act of 2025, aimed at protecting vulnerable coral reef species through strict regulations on their trade and conservation efforts. The legislation is designed to prohibit harmful practices and ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems.

The bill arises amid increasing concerns over the decline of coral reefs globally, driven by climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices. Marine reefs play a vital role in biodiversity and coastal protection, making their preservation critical not only for marine life but also for communities relying on these ecosystems for their livelihoods.

The Saving NEMO Act specifically targets marine reef species listed under international conservation agreements, aiming to restrict their capture, import, and export within U.S. waters. It seeks to establish a framework for designating certain species that face critical threats, enabling federal authorities to enforce prohibitive actions against unsustainable practices.

Key provisions of the bill include the prohibition of taking, importing, or exporting covered coral reef species without proper authorization, thereby preventing practices that could lead to high mortality rates or ecological damage. The proposed law introduces civil and criminal penalties for violations, reflecting the government's commitment to enforcing marine protection more rigorously.

If passed, the legislation could serve as a benchmark for national and international marine conservation efforts, potentially influencing policies beyond U.S. borders. By prioritizing reef species protection, the Saving NEMO Act underlines the urgency of addressing environmental degradation and promotes sustainable practices in marine resource management. The bill has been referred to the Committees on Natural Resources, Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs for consideration, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the Tradeable Energy Performance Standards Act, aiming to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a system of tradeable performance standards for large electricity producers and thermal energy users. This legislation seeks to enhance emission reduction initiatives while promoting the transition to cleaner energy sources.

The Tradeable Energy Performance Standards Act arises from increasing concerns about climate change and the necessity to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. By introducing a market-driven approach, this bill intends to create a framework where emissions allowances can be traded among energy producers, fostering competitive pricing and incentivizing reductions in carbon emissions. The overarching goal is to diminish the reliance on fossil fuels while encouraging the growth of renewable energy resources, reflecting a significant step towards achieving national and international climate goals.

Under the proposed legislation, large energy producers would be required to submit emission allowances annually, complying with regulations that are anticipated to be enforced beginning in 2028. The framework includes provisions for the trading of emission allowances, allowing facilities that exceed their emission targets to sell excess allowances to other companies struggling to meet their requirements. This creates an environment that not only encourages innovation in cleaner technologies but also aims to ensure an orderly market for emissions.

The bill signifies a broader commitment from lawmakers to tackle climate issues following years of heightened awareness surrounding environmental sustainability. With bipartisan discussions increasingly focusing on climate strategies, the Tradeable Energy Performance Standards Act symbolizes progressing legislative efforts to implement robust and effective measures against climate change.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the Cerebral Palsy Research Program Authorization Act of 2025. The bill aims to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a comprehensive research program focused on cerebral palsy, one of the most common lifelong motor impairments affecting children in the United States.

The introduction of the bill comes in response to the urgent need for enhanced research and understanding of cerebral palsy, which impacts over one million Americans and is diagnosed in more than 10,000 babies annually. Despite its prevalence, extensive gaps remain in knowledge regarding its causes and effective treatments. The act seeks to address these gaps by facilitating public health surveillance and promising avenues for diagnosis and treatment, while also quantifying the significant healthcare and societal costs associated with the condition.

Cerebral palsy is often accompanied by various additional developmental disabilities, magnifying the urgent need for effective research initiatives. Evidence suggests that improved understanding of the condition can lead to breakthroughs in treatment and prevention strategies. The legislation authorizes $5 million each year from 2026 to 2031 to support these research efforts, emphasizing the necessity of tailored training for healthcare professionals and education for the public regarding the implications and ramifications of cerebral palsy.

Cohen's bill has garnered attention from fellow lawmakers, indicating a bipartisan recognition of the pressing need to address the complexities surrounding cerebral palsy. By fostering a dedicated research program, this initiative not only aims to uplift the lives of individuals affected by cerebral palsy but also hopes to enhance the broader public health landscape in the country. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the America First Equipment and Information Act, a legislative initiative aimed at prohibiting all military assistance to Russia. This bill seeks to enhance U.S. national security by restricting the provision of military equipment, technology, and classified information to a nation viewed as a significant threat to U.S. interests.

The America First Equipment and Information Act was introduced in response to ongoing aggressive actions by the Russian Federation, which have raised concerns regarding global stability. By limiting military exchanges and information sharing, proponents argue the bill aims to prevent sensitive U.S. military resources from falling into the wrong hands. The legislation specifically prohibits Foreign Military Financing and Foreign Military Sales to Russia, as well as direct commercial sales and any form of intelligence sharing.

The bill's impact could be substantial, representing a firm stance by the U.S. government against what it perceives as Russian incursions that jeopardize not only American national security but also that of its allies. By enforcing strict regulations on military cooperation, the U.S. intends to signal its commitment to maintaining global security.

Cohen believes that this legislative action is necessary for safeguarding U.S. interests. The bill mandates annual compliance reports to appropriate congressional committees, ensuring oversight of U.S. military dealings with Russia. The act defines these committees as the House Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Judiciary committees, alongside their Senate counterparts.

Ultimately, the America First Equipment and Information Act represents a strategic shift in U.S. foreign policy, reflecting escalating tensions with Russia and a renewed focus on prioritizing national security above all else.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2180",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Keep the Watchdogs Running Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Keep the Watchdogs Running Act, a crucial piece of legislation aimed at ensuring the continued operation of Inspectors General during lapses in government appropriations. The bill seeks to empower these oversight bodies by allowing them to incur obligations and continue their oversight activities even when funding is temporarily unavailable.

The impetus for this legislation stems from past government shutdowns, which have hindered the ability of Inspectors General to monitor federal agencies effectively. Without the ability to function during these times, accountability and transparency lose significant ground, risking mismanagement and inefficiencies. By enabling Inspectors General to operate under a set framework during funding gaps, the bill aims to uphold ethical standards and oversight in government operations.

This legislation has broad implications, particularly in maintaining the integrity of federal programs that directly serve the public. Allowing Inspectors General to continue their operations ensures that vital oversight continues, which can prevent potential fraud, waste, and abuse, ultimately safeguarding taxpayer resources. The continuity of such oversight has been recognized as essential to fostering public trust and confidence in government activities.

As of now, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further discussion and deliberation. If passed, the Keep the Watchdogs Running Act would amend Section 406(g) of Title 5 of the United States Code, specifically addressing operations during lapses in appropriations.

Connolly's move highlights a growing acknowledgment among lawmakers of the importance of maintaining robust governmental oversight, particularly during uncertain financial times. With significant bipartisan support anticipated, the path forward for this legislation appears promising.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2181",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Protect Our Watchdogs Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Protect Our Watchdogs Act, designed to establish a for-cause removal standard for Inspectors General (IGs) within federal agencies. This legislation aims to enhance the accountability and independence of these critical oversight officials who are tasked with detecting and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in government operations.

The Protect Our Watchdogs Act comes in response to a growing concern about the arbitrary removal of Inspectors General without cause, which undermines their ability to perform their duties effectively. By codifying specific grounds for removal, such as neglect of duty, malfeasance, or documented inefficiency, the bill seeks to protect IGs from political retribution and ensure they can carry out investigations without fear of losing their positions for unpopular findings.

This initiative has become critical in light of instances where previous administrations dismissed Inspectors General amid politically sensitive investigations. Advocates argue that ensuring a standardized process for removal will promote transparency and integrity within federal oversight systems.

The proposed legislation could have significant implications for governance by reinforcing the principle that Inspectors General must be free to operate independently. Should the bill pass, it would lead to greater trust in government oversight, potentially reducing public skepticism regarding how federal agencies operate. 

Currently, the Protect Our Watchdogs Act has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will undergo further scrutiny. As public calls for government accountability grow, this bill represents an increasingly vital step towards safeguarding the integrity of federal oversight mechanisms.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2182",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces Pre-Pilot Pathway Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the Pre-Pilot Pathway Act to facilitate the development of a national apprenticeship program for aspiring pilots. This program aims to create a structured pathway for students enrolled in flight training providers to acquire necessary skills and qualifications, thereby addressing ongoing shortages in the aviation industry.

The Pre-Pilot Pathway Act was introduced against a backdrop of increasing demand for commercial pilots, driven by a combination of industry growth and an aging workforce. With many pilots approaching retirement age, the need for a steady influx of qualified pilots has become paramount. This legislation seeks not only to simplify the training process for new pilots but also to enhance the overall safety and effectiveness of flight operations by raising training standards across the industry.

Under the proposed act, the Secretary of Transportation will oversee the establishment of the apprenticeship program, working closely with flight training providers and industry stakeholders. This program will allow participating training providers to select up to eight students each academic year to serve as apprentices, exposing them to real-world experiences and mentorship opportunities.

Participants in the program will go through a rigorous curriculum aligned with the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations, ensuring that they meet the high standards required to graduate as pilots. The act also encourages retired and transitioning pilots to engage as instructors or mentors, thereby enhancing the training landscape through their expertise.

Annual progress reports will be submitted to Congress to evaluate the program's effectiveness and its impact on the pilot shortage. With this initiative, Rep. Donalds aims to not only fill the gaps in the pilot workforce but also to cultivate a new generation of aviators prepared to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving aviation sector.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom Emmer, R-MN, has introduced the CFPB Dual Mandate and Economic Analysis Act, aimed at amending the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The legislation seeks to update the operational purpose of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, emphasizing enhanced private sector participation in financial markets while concurrently instituting a new Office of Economic Analysis within the Bureau.

The impetus for this bill arises from ongoing debates regarding the effectiveness and impact of existing consumer financial regulations. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework can unintentionally stifle competition and consumer choice. By redefining the Bureau's mission to include the encouragement of private sector participation, the act aims to foster a more dynamic financial landscape that could benefit consumers through increased choices and potentially lower prices.

One of the key components of the bill is the establishment of the Office of Economic Analysis, which would assess the potential impacts of the Bureau’s regulatory actions. This office would review proposed guidance and regulations, evaluating their effects on consumer choice, access to credit, and pricing structures. Additionally, it would mandate periodic reviews of existing regulations to measure their effectiveness over time.

The bill's supporters believe that a more analytical approach to rulemaking will help identify whether regulations are achieving their intended goals and addressing consumer needs effectively. This move comes as part of a broader push among some lawmakers to recalibrate regulatory agencies to better balance consumer protection with market vitality.

By focusing on the dual mandate of both consumer protection and increased economic analysis, Rep. Emmer's proposed legislation aims to reshape consumer financial regulation in a way that promotes competitive marketplace practices while safeguarding consumer interests.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2184",40434,"Rep. Emmer Introduces Firearm Due Process Protection Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom Emmer, R-MN, has introduced the Firearm Due Process Protection Act aimed at improving the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This legislation seeks to enforce a 60-day deadline for the system to make final decisions on requests to correct its records, thereby protecting the rights of individuals seeking to legally purchase firearms.

The introduction of this bill stems from ongoing concerns regarding the accuracy and timely handling of background checks that can prevent eligible gun buyers from obtaining firearms. Recent reports have indicated significant delays and inaccuracies within the NICS, leading to wrongful denials. The Firearm Due Process Protection Act aims to address these issues by requiring expedited hearings for individuals challenging their eligibility, thus ensuring due process rights are upheld.

Under the proposed legislation, courts would be mandated to hold a hearing within 30 days for cases brought under this act. Importantly, the burden of proof would shift to the government, which would have to demonstrate, with clear and convincing evidence, that an individual is ineligible to receive or possess a firearm. Additionally, the bill calls for annual reports to Congress on the challenges brought against the NICS, fostering transparency regarding its operations.

By enforcing stricter deadlines and procedural rules, the bill seeks to eliminate bureaucratic delays that infringe upon the constitutional rights of gun owners. Emmer's measure reflects a broader narrative among lawmakers advocating for a balance between gun rights and public safety, aiming to ensure that all citizens can exercise their rights without undue obstruction or delay. This legislation is expected to elicit varied reactions among lawmakers as discussions on gun control continue in Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, has introduced the Mink VIRUS Act aimed at prohibiting the farming of mink for their fur. The legislation seeks to enhance public health and safety by eliminating a farming practice that poses potential health risks.

The Mink VIRUS Act comes in response to growing concerns over zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans, specifically those linked to mink farming. In recent years, the spread of COVID-19 among farmed mink has underscored the risks associated with these operations. The bill not only calls for an immediate cessation of mink farming but also establishes a financial compensation program to assist farmers in transitioning out of the fur industry.

Under the proposed legislation, mink farming must cease within one year of the bill's enactment. Farmers will be penalized for non-compliance with civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for operating after the deadline. Additionally, all mink termination must be conducted humanely, adhering to established veterinary guidelines to ensure minimal suffering.

The financial support outlined in the Mink VIRUS Act encompasses payment for the reasonable costs related to transitioning and the market value of the mink farming operations. An initial allocation of $100 million from the U.S. Treasury is designated to fund this compensation program, ensuring assistance is provided to impacted farmers.

As the bill is referred to the House Committees on Agriculture and Budget, its proponents highlight a long-term strategy for safeguarding public health while also addressing economic impacts on farmers. The Mink VIRUS Act reflects a growing movement toward more humane and sustainable agricultural practices in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2186",40434,"Rep. Estes Introduces Stock Ownership Attribution Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced a new bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically targeting the limitations on downward attribution of stock ownership under constructive ownership rules. This legislation seeks to restore provisions that were modified in the past and aims to clarify the ownership status of U.S. shareholders in foreign corporations.

The motivation behind this bill stems from ongoing concerns regarding the complexity and potential loopholes created by current attribution rules, which may lead to unintended tax benefits for certain shareholders. By reinstating previous limitations, the bill aims to provide a clearer framework that ensures fairness in tax regulations and aligns with the original intent of the tax code. 

If enacted, the bill could significantly impact foreign-controlled U.S. shareholders, mandating that their stock attribution aligns more closely with established ownership guidelines. Supporters argue that this will reduce the risk of tax evasion while ensuring that U.S. tax laws are applied consistently, helping to level the playing field among domestic and foreign investors.

Historically, the tax code has undergone various amendments, and the changes proposed in this bill reflect a broader legislative effort to fine-tune tax regulations that apply to international transactions. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it will undergo scrutiny and discussion before potentially moving forward.

As lawmakers focus more on tax reform and transparency, this proposed legislation signifies a critical step towards enhancing the integrity of the U.S. tax system and ensuring that it effectively addresses modern economic challenges.

This legislation seeks to extend the existing diesel emissions reduction program through 2029, ensuring continued support for efforts to retrofit and replace older diesel engines.

The bill was introduced against the backdrop of increasing concerns regarding air quality and public health, particularly in urban areas disproportionately affected by diesel emissions. Diesel engines are significant contributors to air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can cause respiratory illnesses and other health issues. By reauthorizing this program, the legislation seeks to lower these emissions, promoting cleaner air and supporting local environmental initiatives.

If passed, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2025 could significantly impact emissions levels, potentially benefiting millions of Americans living near heavily trafficked areas. The program aims not only to reduce pollution but also to encourage the transition to cleaner technologies, providing financial incentives for stakeholders in transportation and logistics.

The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act is a part of a broader movement in Congress to tackle environmental issues through comprehensive legislation. By sustaining these vital programs, lawmakers hope to improve air quality, contribute to climate change mitigation efforts, and promote public health initiatives.

Overall, Rep. Matsui's introduction of this bill signals a commitment to environmental stewardship and public health, marking a proactive step in addressing the challenges posed by diesel emissions across the United States. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-RI, has introduced the Strengthening State and Local Efforts to Counter Transnational Repression Act, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing the capabilities of state and local law enforcement in combating transnational repression and related terrorism threats. The bill seeks to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, ensuring law enforcement agencies receive comprehensive training to address issues of coercion, harassment, and violence tied to foreign government actions.

The introduction of this bill reflects growing concerns over transnational repression, which refers to actions by foreign governments that target individuals for retaliation or coercion, even within U.S. borders. This has become especially pertinent as instances of foreign influence and interference have risen, prompting calls for stronger protections for U.S. citizens. By prioritizing state and local law enforcement training in identifying and combating these threats, the legislation aims to better equip officials in recognizing and mitigating potential incidents of foreign aggression.

Should the bill pass, it could significantly impact regional law enforcement operations by integrating new training protocols developed in consultation with various stakeholders, ensuring that officers are prepared to confront the unique challenges posed by transnational repression. The legislation emphasizes collaboration between law enforcement and community organizations, widening the safety net for potential victims and those targeted by foreign entities.

The bill is currently referred to the House Committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary for further consideration, where discussions are expected to detail the implications and logistics of implementing these necessary training programs. Proponents believe that strengthening local capabilities is vital for upholding civil liberties while safeguarding against emergent threats to national security.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2138",40434,"Rep. Luttrell Introduces Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-TX, has introduced the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2025, aimed at increasing compensation rates for veterans with service-connected disabilities and for survivors of certain disabled veterans. This bill proposes adjustments to the compensation amounts effective December 1, 2025, reflecting changes similar to the cost-of-living adjustments applicable to Social Security benefits.

The legislation is a response to ongoing concerns regarding the financial well-being of veterans and their families, many of whom face economic challenges. It underscores the commitment to support these individuals who have sacrificed for their country. By aligning veterans' compensation with Social Security adjustments, the bill aims to ensure that veterans do not fall behind in an economy marked by inflation and rising living costs.

If enacted, the bill would adjust various compensation rates, including those for wartime disability and additional support for dependents, in a manner consistent with increases determined under the Social Security Act. This approach seeks to provide timely financial relief to veterans and their families, acknowledging the sometimes overwhelming costs associated with disability care and living expenses.

The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act thus aims not only to provide necessary financial adjustments but also to reinforce the U.S. government's commitment to its veterans. As the legislation moves through the legislative process, it will be crucial to monitor its development and the reception from both the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and wider congressional members.

The bill (H.R. 2138) introduced on 03/14/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. McGarvey, Morgan [D-KY-3]...03/14/2025; Rep. Weber, Randy K. Sr. [R-TX-14]...03/14/2025; Rep. Pfluger, August [R-TX-11]...03/14/2025.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2137",40434,"Rep. Luttrell Introduces Review Every Veterans Claim Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-TX, recently introduced the Review Every Veterans Claim Act of 2025, aimed at reforming the process by which veterans' claims for benefits are evaluated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The legislation seeks to prevent the denial of claims solely on the basis that veterans failed to attend a scheduled medical examination.

The introduction of this bill stems from ongoing concerns that many veterans are unjustly denied benefits due to missed appointments, which can arise from various legitimate reasons, including health issues or lack of transportation. By amending Title 38 of the United States Code, the proposed legislation ensures that a veteran's claim cannot be dismissed without considering the entirety of their circumstances and supporting documentation.

If passed, this bill could significantly impact veterans across the nation, potentially increasing the approval rate of claims and ensuring that deserving individuals receive the benefits they have earned through their service. The measure has garnered bipartisan support, indicating a collective recognition of the need for reform in the veterans' claims process.

Currently, veterans must navigate a complex system that often leaves them vulnerable to bureaucratic oversights. The Review Every Veterans Claim Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for the VA, ensuring that missed examinations do not automatically negate a veteran’s right to benefits. This shift in policy is not only expected to improve the quality of care afforded to veterans but may also encourage more individuals to step forward for necessary evaluations without fearing the repercussions of nonattendance.

As the bill moves forward within the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, many advocates for veteran services are voicing their support, emphasizing that every claim deserves a thorough review based on merit, rather than administrative technicalities.

The bill (H.R. 2137) introduced on 03/14/2025 has 4 co-sponsors: Rep. McGarvey, Morgan [D-KY-3]...03/14/2025; Rep. Weber, Randy K. Sr. [R-TX-14]...03/14/2025; Rep. Pfluger, August [R-TX-11]...03/14/2025; Rep. Mills, Cory [R-FL-7]...03/25/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-FL, has introduced the SHRED Act of 2025, which aims to tighten the penalties for government officials who conceal, remove, or mutilate official records. The legislation is designed particularly for employees within the Department of Justice and members of the intelligence community.

The SHRED Act was prompted by growing concerns over transparency and accountability in government operations, especially in light of recent incidents where sensitive records were purportedly mishandled. By specifying stronger penalties, the bill seeks to deter misconduct among public servants, reinforcing the importance of safeguarding government documents that are crucial to public trust and national security.

If enacted, the bill would amend Title 18 of the United States Code, introducing harsher penalties that include imprisonment for a minimum of 20 years for those found guilty of these offenses. This legislative push reflects a broader legislative trend aimed at enhancing accountability in federal institutions, particularly in an era marked by increasing scrutiny of governmental actions.

Supporters of the SHRED Act argue that the current penalties are often insufficient to discourage improper conduct, and that higher stakes may lead to more responsible behavior among officials when handling sensitive information. This initiative also aligns with a growing bipartisan commitment to strengthening the integrity of government processes.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Judiciary Committee, where it will undergo analysis and debate. The outcome could set an important precedent for how the government deals with breaches of trust by its employees, fostering a culture of greater accountability and transparency moving forward.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-NM, has introduced a new bill aimed at facilitating a land exchange between Caza Ranches LLC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The proposal seeks to transfer approximately 160 acres of federal land in Artesia, New Mexico, to the ranch, while the ranch will convey an equal area of non-federal land to the government.

This bill is significant as it addresses the needs of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers located in Artesia. With the burgeoning demands for enhanced training capabilities for federal law enforcement personnel, the exchange will enable the DHS to utilize the land effectively for training activities, thus enhancing operational readiness. By formalizing this land swap, the bill aims to streamline land use, ensuring both entities can meet their objectives without conflict.

The rationale behind introducing this legislation stems from ongoing discussions regarding the efficient use of federal resources. The land exchange aims to remove bureaucratic red tape that often slows progress and allows for a more collaborative approach between private interests and government operations. By establishing a straightforward process for the land transfer, the bill intends to address practical concerns while maintaining legal and regulatory standards.

The potential impact includes not only bolstering training infrastructure but also ensuring that local economic interests are taken into account. The agreement stipulates that the costs associated with the exchange shall be shared equally by both parties, promoting a sense of partnership. The legislation has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration, with supporters hoping for swift passage to address pressing training needs.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Susie Lee, D-NV, has introduced the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act to bolster economic growth and enhance environmental conservation in southern Nevada. The legislation aims to transfer significant land parcels to local tribes, adjust conservation area boundaries, and support local government initiatives while promoting sustainability.

The bill's introduction comes as southern Nevada faces continual growth challenges, necessitating strategies to balance economic development with environmental protection. By empowering local tribes through land transfers, the act is expected to foster tribal economic empowerment and self-governance, cultivating new opportunities for the Moapa Band of Paiutes and the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe.

Key provisions of the bill include designations for new wilderness areas, adjustments to existing conservation boundaries, and designated public safety lands. These measures aim to preserve natural resources while facilitating necessary urban expansion and development projects. Additionally, it allows local governments in Clark County to convey federal lands for essential public purposes, including fire training facilities and water management infrastructure.

Supporters argue that the bill could have a substantial positive impact on Nevada's economy by creating jobs, enhancing public safety, and improving water management. Furthermore, the establishment of off-highway vehicle recreation areas is designed to promote tourism and outdoor recreational activities, thereby contributing to the local economy.

If passed, this comprehensive legislative effort may set a precedent for similar initiatives nationwide, illustrating a model for balancing indigenous rights, conservation needs, and urban development. The Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act is now referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicholas Langworthy, R-NY, has introduced the Lakes Before Turbines Act, a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code. The bill seeks to eliminate the investment tax credit for offshore wind facilities located in the inland navigable waters of the United States, particularly affecting installations in the Great Lakes. 

The introduction of this bill is grounded in the belief that the fiscal incentives for offshore wind development pose potential environmental risks and economic implications for local communities. Langworthy's initiative reflects ongoing debates about the balance between renewable energy expansion and the protection of significant water bodies vital for recreation and wildlife. The bill aims to halt the financial support currently extended to wind energy facilities in these inland waters, arguing that natural resources should be prioritized over industrial development.

The potential impact of the Lakes Before Turbines Act focuses on redirecting energy investments toward the advancement of technologies that do not compromise environmental resources. Proponents argue that the reduction in credits could also open avenues for alternative renewable energy solutions that align more harmoniously with ecological preservation.

Langworthy emphasized the need to carefully evaluate the structural placement of wind turbines, showcasing concerns regarding their impact on water quality, fishing industries, and tourism. The Great Lakes, comprising 84% of North America's fresh water, is a crucial ecosystem, and the legislation reflects the anticipation of protecting these waters from large-scale industrial encroachments.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means, it will likely ignite discussions among lawmakers about the future of energy policies and their environmental consequences. The Lakes Before Turbines Act represents a significant step in the policy landscape regarding renewable energy and environmental conservation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, R-MP, has introduced the Marianas Air Service Improvement Act, aimed at enhancing air travel accessibility for the Northern Mariana Islands by exempting it from specific eligibility requirements under the essential air service program.

The bill, presented on March 14, 2025, seeks to address current limitations that restrict the Northern Mariana Islands from receiving essential air services comparable to those available in other states. By amending title 49 of the United States Code, the proposed legislation aims to promote transportation equity, allowing islands to better connect with major transportation hubs and support local economies dependent on tourism and commerce.

King-Hinds emphasized the importance of reliable air service, noting that the islands face unique challenges due to their remote location. The crucial need for improved air service has been compounded by the growing demands of residents, tourists, and businesses striving for connectivity with mainland U.S. markets.

The bill's introduction responds to concerns raised by community leaders and residents regarding the potential economic boosts associated with better air travel options. Removing eligibility barriers will open new routes for airlines, likely leading to enhanced service offerings, higher frequency of flights, and potentially reduced fares for travelers.

With bipartisan support anticipated, the Marianas Air Service Improvement Act reflects a growing recognition of the need to prioritize transportation projects that ensure all U.S. territories receive equal service opportunities. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further review, with advocates hopeful for swift progress through the legislative process.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Thomas H. Kean, R-NJ, has introduced the Presidential Security Resources Reimbursement Act, aiming to improve the financial cooperation between federal and local agencies involved in securing presidential events. The bill seeks to authorize the Secret Service to reimburse state and local governments for their personnel and resources.

This legislation responds to increasing demands on local law enforcement agencies, especially during high-profile presidential activities. By facilitating reimbursement, Rep. Kean intends to alleviate the financial burden that often falls on local governments when they allocate resources for federal security operations. The act specifies that the Secretary of Homeland Security can use state and local resources, provided they consent, and will cover these costs retroactively for services rendered since July 2024.

The potential impact of this bill is substantial, fostering better collaboration between local law enforcement and the Secret Service. It aims not only to ease the financial load on local governments, which often have to stretch their budgets to accommodate large-scale security needs during presidential visits, but also to enhance overall security measures during these events.

Historically, local agencies have been left to manage the costs associated with their assistance during federal operations, which can lead to tensions and financial strain. The introduction of this bill aligns with efforts to create a more balanced partnership between federal and local entities, ensuring a smoother operational flow and improving the quality of security provided to the President.

With the bill currently referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, its future will hinge on bipartisan support as legislators recognize the importance of effective security measures and the need for proper funding.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-SD, has introduced the Tribal Trust Land Homeownership Act of 2025, aimed at streamlining the mortgage process for residential and business properties on Indian lands. This legislative effort seeks to enhance homeownership opportunities and economic development within tribal communities by mandating the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to meet specific processing deadlines for mortgage-related documentation.

The bill was prompted by the persistent challenges faced by Native Americans in securing loans for home acquisitions and construction on tribal lands, often due to prolonged processing times that can thwart potential homeowners. By establishing strict timeframes—including a preliminary review within ten days and final approval decisions for different mortgage types within 20 to 30 days—the legislation aims to reduce bureaucratic delays and improve accessibility to financing options.

Additionally, the act proposes the creation of a Realty Ombudsman position within the BIA. This role will serve as a liaison between the BIA, tribal members, and lenders, facilitating communication and ensuring compliance with the new processing timelines. This initiative is expected to bolster trust and engagement among stakeholders, ultimately fostering more robust economic growth within tribal nations.

Historically, Native American homeowners have encountered various barriers due to the unique legal and regulatory frameworks governing tribal trust lands. The Tribal Trust Land Homeownership Act represents a significant step forward in addressing these obstacles, aligning federal support with the needs and aspirations of tribal communities. If passed, the act could significantly impact housing choices and stimulate economic activity in regions where many residents are eager to invest in their homes and businesses.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA, has introduced the No Round Up Act, a legislation aimed at repealing the Alien Registration Act of 1940, with the intent to modernize and reform immigration laws in the United States. The bill seeks to eliminate outdated provisions that have historically led to the surveillance and registration of non-citizen residents.

The introduction of the No Round Up Act is grounded in concerns over civil liberties and the negative implications of the Alien Registration Act, which many view as an artifact of a bygone era. The Act historically required the registration of non-citizens, subjecting them to unnecessary scrutiny and potential discrimination. Jayapal asserts that in a contemporary context, such measures are not only outdated but detrimental to community trust and integration.

By repealing this Act, the No Round Up Act is expected to have a profound impact on the lives of immigrant communities. Its proponents argue that it will promote a more inclusive environment, where non-citizens do not fear excessive government surveillance or punitive measures linked to their immigration status. This change is particularly relevant in light of recent discussions around the treatment of immigrants in the U.S., highlighting a shift towards a more humane and equitable approach to immigration policy.

Co-sponsored by numerous Democratic representatives, the No Round Up Act signals a broader movement within the party towards immigration reform. This initiative mirrors wider societal shifts advocating for the rights and contributions of immigrants, aligning with calls for justice and equitable treatment in legislation governing immigration practices.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-TX, has introduced the Reimbursing Border Communities Act of 2025, aimed at providing financial support to communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill seeks to authorize grants for local governments near the border to cover expenses related to security measures, including increased personnel costs for law enforcement.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns among border communities regarding the financial burden of enhanced security measures amid rising immigration and related challenges. Many municipalities have claimed that existing federal support has been insufficient to address the strains on local resources necessitated by these security demands. 

Under the proposed legislation, eligible communities could receive grants of up to $500,000 annually to assist with costs incurred for bolstering local law enforcement and other security measures. Restrictions are included to ensure that funds are not used to aid nonprofit organizations or provide services to undocumented immigrants, thereby focusing the financial aid strictly on strengthening community security. 

This bill delineates strict criteria for grant eligibility, limiting assistance to local governments within 200 miles of the border that adhere to federal immigration laws. Reports on the effectiveness of the grants are mandated to be submitted annually to both House and Senate committees to ensure accountability and track the program's efficacy through 2035.

With $25 million authorized for each fiscal year from 2026 to 2036, this initiative represents a concerted effort by federal lawmakers to respond to the needs of communities that feel the direct impact of border security issues, showcasing the ongoing debate over immigration policy and local governance responsibilities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-IA, has introduced the Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act of 2025, aiming to impose stringent sanctions on Chinese police departments and individuals attempting to establish a police presence in the United States. This legislation seeks to protect American citizens from foreign law enforcement overreach and maintain national security.

The bill was prompted by growing concerns regarding reports of Chinese law enforcement agencies operating unlawfully in the U.S., threatening the privacy and safety of residents. Specifically, the legislation targets organizations that allegedly attempt to monitor, intimidate, or harass individuals of Chinese descent living in the U.S. The growing number of incidents involving foreign agents raises alarm among lawmakers regarding the implications for civil liberties and the integrity of U.S. sovereignty.

If enacted, the Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act would provide the President the authority to sanction any Chinese police entity or individual deemed responsible for or affiliated with efforts to enforce Chinese laws on American soil. This includes blocking property and interests related to these entities within U.S. jurisdiction. Furthermore, it would render individuals involved in such activities inadmissible for U.S. visas and revoke their existing visas to limit their entry into the country.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, as it not only signifies a hardline stance against foreign influence but also aims to reassure constituents that their safety is a priority. As awareness of foreign interference grows, Congress will scrutinize the bill's provisions closely to ensure it balances national security with protecting civil rights.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2126",40434,"Rep. Higgins Introduces FOCA Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Clay Higgins, R-LA, recently introduced the *Fair and Open Competition Act of 2025* (FOCA), aimed at promoting neutrality in labor relations within federal construction projects. The proposed legislation seeks to ensure open competition and eliminate any requirements or preferences pertaining to labor organization affiliations among contractors and subcontractors.

The FOCA was created in response to concerns around increasing costs and bureaucratic barriers faced by small and disadvantaged businesses in federal contracting. By ensuring federal contractors are not discriminated against based on their labor organization affiliations, the bill intends to lower construction costs for taxpayers while also enhancing job opportunities within the industry. The legislation aims to prevent federal agencies from mandating workers to join a union as a condition for employment on federally funded projects.

This bill's passage could significantly impact the construction industry by creating a level playing field for contractors, ultimately fostering a more competitive landscape. It is anticipated that such reforms will encourage small contractors, who often struggle against larger firms with established union ties, to bid on federal projects more aggressively. 

The FOCA takes a broader approach to ensure that workers' and employers' rights are respected without favoring one party over another, thereby fostering a more conducive environment for open competition in federal construction. This aligns with the ongoing dialogue across the nation regarding labor relations and the balance of interests between employers and unions, particularly in a post-pandemic economy striving for equitable recovery and growth. 

The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further review.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark Green, R-TN, has introduced the SOS Act of 2025 to establish the National Commission on the Maritime Industrial Base. The purpose of this legislation is to evaluate the current state of the United States maritime industry, focusing on its critical role in national defense, and recommend policies to revitalize and strengthen this sector.

The SOS Act addresses concerns over the declining state of the maritime industry, which is vital for both military and civilian needs. With a significant number of shipyards closing in recent years, this bill aims to counteract this trend by creating a commission that will investigate not only the industry's current condition but also potential impediments to its growth and competitiveness. Through this study, the commission will emphasize the importance of skilled labor in shipbuilding and maritime operations.

Rep. Green highlighted the importance of sustaining a robust maritime workforce to ensure national security. By fostering investment in shipyards and creating policies that attract skilled workers, the SOS Act seeks to enhance the United States' ability to maintain a strong naval fleet capable of responding to emerging threats.

The commission will consist of experts from various relevant fields and will be tasked with submitting a comprehensive report to Congress within a year after its formation. This report will include analysis and recommendations for legislative action to support the maritime industry's goals of job retention, military readiness, and economic viability.

Overall, the SOS Act of 2025 represents a proactive approach to fortifying a key sector of the U.S. economy and enhancing national defense capabilities, engaging both legislative and industry leaders in this vital mission.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2124",40434,"Rep. Gill Introduces LAND Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brandon Gill, R-TX, has introduced legislation aimed at placing restrictions on foreign purchasers of agricultural land in the United States. The proposed LAND Act requires that these purchasers adhere to the same limitations as U.S. citizens when acquiring similar properties within their home countries.

The introduction of the LAND Act responds to growing concerns regarding foreign ownership of American agricultural land, which has been linked to national security issues and the importance of ensuring local food production. By aligning foreign purchasers' obligations with those of U.S. citizens, the bill seeks to safeguard domestic interests and limit potential risks associated with foreign entities controlling essential agricultural resources.

The potential impact of the LAND Act is significant. By mandating that foreign buyers comply with domestic regulations applicable to U.S. citizens, the bill not only aims to protect national security and food supply chains but also seeks to foster a more level playing field for American farmers competing against foreign interests. This legislation calls for thorough reporting and notification procedures, including mandatory disclosures to the Secretary of Agriculture for any land sales to foreign entities, thereby enhancing transparency and awareness at both the community and federal levels.

The legislation also establishes the U.S. Land Protection Task Force, which will identify and report any violations of the new rules. This task force will consist of representatives from various government departments, ensuring a comprehensive approach to enforcing the restrictions.

As foreign investment in agricultural land continues to rise, Rep. Gill's LAND Act represents a proactive measure aimed at preserving the integrity of U.S. agriculture and addressing the concerns of constituents wary of foreign influence in local economies.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2123",40434,"Rep. Garbarino Introduces NFIP Extension Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the NFIP Extension Act aimed at reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through September 30, 2025. This proactive move seeks to provide a sustainable framework for flood insurance amidst growing concerns over climate change and increasing severe weather patterns affecting numerous communities across the nation.

The NFIP has been instrumental in enabling homeowners in flood-prone areas to obtain insurance coverage, thereby reducing the financial burden on state and federal resources in the aftermath of flooding disasters. However, the program's authorization was set to lapse on September 30, 2023, prompting the need for this legislative action. The extension is meant to avert a gap in coverage that could leave many vulnerable residents without vital insurance during a crucial period of heightened flood risk.

Garbarino's bill also addresses adjustments to key provisions of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, including amendments that clarify the financing structure and ensure the program remains effective over the next two years. The extension is seen as a necessary step to stabilize the housing market in affected regions and provide homeowners with peace of mind as they contend with unpredictable weather events.

Community advocates and local governments have expressed strong support for the extension, highlighting its role in promoting better disaster preparedness and recovery strategies. As the bill progresses, it will undergo scrutiny and debate in the House Financial Services Committee, with stakeholders closely monitoring its implications for both homeowners and the broader infrastructure framework that supports flood resilience in high-risk areas.

The bill (H.R. 2123) was introduced on 03/14/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Valerie Foushee, D-NC, has introduced the IMPACT Act 2.0, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of the U.S. cement, concrete, asphalt binder, and asphalt mixture production sectors. The bill, introduced on March 14, 2025, seeks to advance research and technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these industries while promoting the use of low-emissions materials in public infrastructure projects.

The introduction of the IMPACT Act 2.0 is a response to growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of construction materials. The legislation underscores the importance of innovation in manufacturing processes and encourages states to update their standards for cement and asphalt to utilize materials that emit fewer pollutants. By providing financial incentives and reimbursement options for using low-emission materials, the bill aims to facilitate a shift towards sustainable construction practices.

Central to the bill is the establishment of a directory maintained by the Federal Highway Administration, which will list approved low-emissions products eligible for state reimbursement. This aligns with ongoing efforts to meet national sustainability goals and reduce the carbon footprint of the construction industry. Additionally, the bill allows states to enter advance purchase commitments for innovative construction materials, further supporting long-term adoption of environmentally friendly practices.

If successful, the IMPACT Act 2.0 could significantly influence the way infrastructure projects are designed and implemented across the country. The bill not only promises to bolster the domestic construction materials industry but also emphasizes the role of local and state entities in driving environmental progress. As the nation confronts the challenges of climate change, this legislation represents a proactive measure to ensure that infrastructure development aligns with sustainability goals.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced a bill to establish a commission focused on studying the potential creation of a National Museum of Irish American History. The proposed commission aims to explore the need, location, and logistical requirements for this museum, reflecting on the rich contributions of Irish Americans to U.S. history and culture.

This initiative arises amid growing advocacy for greater representation of diverse cultures within national institutions. As Irish Americans have significantly shaped American society, this proposed museum would honor their legacy and promote cultural preservation. By validating the historical perspective of this community, the museum would serve both educational and celebratory purposes, drawing interest from a national audience.

The commission will consist of 23 members, appointed by the President and congressional leaders. These individuals will be experts in various relevant fields, including museum administration, fundraising, and the study of Irish-American culture. Their collective insights are expected to inform Congress on the feasibility and design of the museum, guiding decisions on funding and location.

The bill also outlines the responsibilities of the commission, including producing a detailed report that outlines the necessary actions for establishing the museum, as well as a fundraising plan aimed at ensuring its sustainability without ongoing federal funding. The goal is to create a culturally enriching space in Washington, D.C., that fosters a deeper appreciation of Irish-American heritage and its role in the broader narrative of U.S. history.

If successful, this initiative could not only enhance cultural education but also attract tourism, positively impacting the local economy. The establishment of such a museum would mark a significant step towards inclusivity in American civic life by recognizing and honoring historically underrepresented communities.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2120",40434,"Rep. Fitzpatrick Introduces Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Program Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced the Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Program Act, aimed at reforming how Medicare pays for radiation therapy services, specifically by creating a new payment model that improves access and quality of care for cancer patients. 

The bill establishes a fee schedule that eliminates previous budget neutrality adjustments, allowing for stable payments to providers. This move responds to ongoing issues in the current payment system, which has led to fluctuating reimbursement rates for radiation oncology services. With nearly 60% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, Fitzpatrick’s initiative addresses the need for a more sustainable and equitable financial framework for both healthcare providers and patients.

Historically, Medicare has struggled with pricing accuracy in radiation oncology due to high equipment costs and insufficient recognition of the expertise required in delivering these services. The existing incentives often favor higher volumes of care rather than efficiency and patient-centered approaches. Fitzpatrick’s legislation seeks to amend these practices by establishing a value-based payment system that prioritizes high-quality care.

Additionally, the act proposes provisions for free or discounted transportation services for patients, addressing significant transportation barriers that can hinder access to necessary treatments. This focus on logistics is crucial for improving patient adherence to treatment regimens, especially in rural and underserved areas where transportation options are limited.

With referrals already made to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, the bill highlights a bipartisan acknowledgment of the pressing challenges facing cancer care in the Medicare system, aiming to enhance the overall patient experience while keeping costs reasonable. The proposal illustrates a critical shift in healthcare policy towards value-based care models in oncology services.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced a bill aimed at establishing St. Patrick's Day as a federal holiday in the United States. The proposed legislation seeks to amend Title 5 of the United States Code, adding March 17 to the list of recognized federal holidays, thereby encouraging nationwide celebration and unity around Irish-American culture.

The initiative comes as part of a broader effort to recognize and honor the contributions of Irish-Americans throughout U.S. history. Supporters argue that this recognition will not only commemorate the rich traditions associated with St. Patrick's Day but also provide an opportunity for local communities to celebrate diversity and foster connections among various cultural groups. 

Should the bill pass, federal employees would enjoy an additional paid holiday, potentially impacting local economies through increased consumer spending, particularly in areas with large Irish-American populations where celebrations typically involve parades, festivals, and community gatherings. This could, in turn, benefit local businesses and stimulate economic activity, especially in the hospitality sector.

Historically, while St. Patrick’s Day has long been celebrated across the nation—marked by parades, wearing green, and cultural festivities—it has yet to be formally recognized at the federal level. Previous attempts to designate March 17 as a federal holiday have stalled, prompting advocates to hope that renewed interest might gain sufficient momentum this year. 

As the bill proceeds through the legislative process, it will be reviewed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. If passed, this would mark a significant cultural acknowledgment of Irish heritage in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced the Protecting our Guests During Hostilities in Ukraine Act, aiming to provide a temporary guest status for Ukrainian nationals who have fled their home country due to ongoing conflict. This legislation seeks to ensure that eligible individuals can remain in the United States while providing them with employment authorization.

The introduction of this bill is a response to the heightened humanitarian crisis stemming from the hostilities in Ukraine. As the war continues, many Ukrainians are displaced and seeking refuge in safe countries. Fitzpatrick's legislation is designed to streamline the legal status for these individuals, allowing them to work and contribute to the economy as they await the resolution of the conflict. Eligible aliens are defined as those who were paroled under the Uniting for Ukraine parole process initiated in April 2022.

The bill's provisions include granting Ukrainian nationals guest status that will automatically expire 120 days after the Secretary of State declares that hostilities have ceased and conditions in Ukraine permit safe returns. Moreover, this act outlines specific conditions under which the guest status can be revoked, aiming to balance humanitarian support with immigration law.

The proposed legislation highlights Congress's recognition of the urgent needs faced by Ukrainian refugees and signals a commitment to providing necessary assistance during their time of need. As the bill moves to the Judiciary Committee for review, its potential passage could pave the way for broader protections for those affected by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and set a precedent for future humanitarian responses to similar situations.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2117",40434,"Rep. Feenstra Introduces Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-IA, has introduced the Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act, aiming to enhance crop insurance support for beginning and veteran farmers. The bill seeks to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act, extending the eligibility period and increasing assistance for new entrants into agriculture, thereby fostering a new generation of farmers.

The initiative responds to the challenges posed by an aging agricultural workforce and emphasizes the need to attract younger individuals and veterans into farming. Currently, novice farmers are defined as individuals with five crop years of experience, but the proposed legislation extends this to ten years, allowing for a more inclusive transition into farming.

Beginning farmers and veteran ranchers often face financial hurdles, especially during the initial years when they are establishing their operations. By increasing the available assistance and extending the eligibility timeline, the act aims to create a supportive safety net that promotes sustainability within agricultural communities. The proposal includes significant adjustments, such as offering a higher percentage of insurance premium coverage for the first years of participation, which could alleviate some of the financial pressures these new farmers face.

The Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act highlights a commitment to agricultural innovation and economic development. As the number of active farmers dwindles, fostering new talent becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring food security and rural economic stability. With bipartisan support anticipated, this legislation has the potential to significantly impact the future of farming in America, creating a more robust farming economy while honoring the contributions of veteran farmers. Rep. Feenstra's efforts reflect a broader recognition of the importance of nurturing and sustaining the agricultural workforce for years to come.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2116",40434,"Rep. Evans Introduces Law Enforcement Support and Counter Transnational Repression Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Evans, R-CO, has introduced the Law Enforcement Support and Counter Transnational Repression Act, aimed at bolstering public awareness regarding transnational repression and enhancing law enforcement resources. This legislative initiative seeks to educate communities about the threats posed by foreign government coercion and harassment, while providing avenues for victims to report such actions.

The bill arises from growing concerns surrounding foreign entities' influence within the United States and the tactics they employ against individuals who oppose their agendas. With reports of intimidation and human rights abuses crossing national borders, this initiative looks to strategically address these issues through education and support mechanisms. It emphasizes the importance of informing both the public and law enforcement agencies about transnational repression, ensuring that communities are more vigilant and connected.

The Act mandates the Department of Homeland Security to launch a public service announcement campaign that targets both the general public and international allies. These announcements are designed to outline how citizens can safely report suspicious activities that may indicate attempts at repression, including harassment that infringes on First Amendment rights. Specific promotional materials will be created in various languages to ensure accessibility and comprehension among diverse populations.

Moreover, the legislation includes a clause for ongoing research into effective technologies and techniques that can aid federal, state, and local officials in combating these issues. By fostering collaboration among multiple jurisdictions, the Act aspires to create a unified response against evolving threats of transnational repression, ensuring that the U.S. remains a secure haven for free expression and human dignity.

As this bill makes its way through Congress, its supporters hope to catalyze a comprehensive approach that addresses these pressing challenges while safeguarding American citizens' rights.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2115",40434,"Rep. Dunn Introduces Ending China’s Unfair Advantage Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Neal P. Dunn, R-FL, has introduced the Ending China’s Unfair Advantage Act of 2025, aimed at restricting U.S. funding for international climate agreements until China ceases to be classified as a developing country. The bill specifically targets the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The legislation comes in response to growing concerns about China's economic advancement and its standing in global climate negotiations. Critics argue that as the second-largest economy in the world, China should not benefit from the financial resources allocated by developed nations under these agreements. By conditioning funding on a change in China's designation, the bill seeks to shift the balance in international climate commitments and ensure that all major economies contribute their fair share.

If enacted, the bill would prohibit federal funds for the Montreal Protocol and UNFCCC operations until the President certifies that appropriate amendments have been made to exclude China from the developing country designation. This move reflects a broader trend among U.S. lawmakers who are increasingly frustrated with China's environmental policies and assert that the current classification undermines efforts to combat climate change collectively.

With the global climate discussion intensifying, this legislation could significantly impact U.S.-China relations, especially in environmental diplomacy. The potential effects of this bill could also ripple throughout international climate agreements, as various countries reassess their commitments in light of changing definitions and eligibility for funding.

The bill has been referred to both the Foreign Affairs and Energy and Commerce Committees for further consideration. As global warming continues to pose a threat, Congress's action on this bill will be closely monitored by advocates and critics alike.

The bill (H.R. 2115) introduced on 03/14/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Hinson, Ashley [R-IA-2]...03/14/2025; Rep. Moolenaar, John R. [R-MI-2]...03/14/2025.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2114",40434,"Rep. Dunn Introduces Block Organ Transplant Purchases from China Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Neal P. Dunn, R-FL, introduced the Block Organ Transplant Purchases from China Act on March 14, 2025, aimed at prohibiting certain organ transplants connected to the People's Republic of China. The legislation seeks to reinforce ethical standards in the U.S. healthcare system by prohibiting reimbursement for these transplants under Medicare and Medicaid.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing concerns over human rights abuses in China, particularly regarding organ procurement practices. Activists assert that organs may be harvested from prisoners of conscience without consent, raising serious moral and ethical questions. By blocking payments for these procedures, Rep. Dunn aims to safeguard U.S. health standards and draw attention to the need for ethical organ donation practices.

The proposed law intends to amend the Social Security Act, the National Organ Transplant Act, and the Public Health Service Act to implement stricter regulations surrounding organ transplants. It delineates specific human organs that cannot be procured through channels associated with China, effectively prohibiting their donation and transplantation in the U.S. Moreover, it establishes penalties for health care providers who contravene these prohibitions, which could include criminal fines or civil penalties equaling three times the cost of the prohibited transplant.

If enacted, the legislation could significantly impact the existing frameworks of organ donation and transplantation, encouraging ethical practices while reinforcing U.S. foreign policy positions on human rights. The bill will move to the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees for further deliberation, where its potential implications for both healthcare and international relations will be scrutinized. Advocates hope that this measure will contribute to a more humane and ethically sound healthcare system.

The bill (H.R. 2114) introduced on 03/14/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Bilirakis, Gus M. [R-FL-12]...03/14/2025; Rep. Moolenaar, John R. [R-MI-2]...03/14/2025.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2113",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces America Supports Taiwan Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the America Supports Taiwan Act, a legislative measure aimed at establishing a clear preference for official U.S. communications to refer to Taiwan rather than Chinese Taipei. This bill aligns with the ongoing support for Taiwan's autonomy amidst increasing military pressure from China.

The motivation behind the bill stems from rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait, where incursions by Chinese military aircraft have significantly escalated over the years. By mandating the use of Taiwan in government communications, the legislation seeks to reinforce the United States' longstanding policy of supporting Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act.

This legislative push also addresses the connotations associated with the term Chinese Taipei, which many Taiwanese view as a symbol of China's assertive claims over Taiwan. The bill argues that using Taiwan will help avoid implications of Chinese sovereignty over the island and promote a peaceful resolution to cross-Strait issues that respects the will of the Taiwanese people.

If passed, the legislation would require federal agencies to update their websites within 14 days of enactment to reflect this terminology change, while maintaining Chinese Taipei only in historical contexts or when necessary for international engagements where that name is officially recognized. 

The act is seen as a crucial step in bolstering U.S.-Taiwan relations at a time when both nations face external pressures from an increasingly aggressive People's Republic of China. As the geopolitical landscape shifts, proponents believe this bill underscores a commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and its role in the Indo-Pacific region.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2112",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced a new house bill aimed at legally formalizing the Executive Order issued on March 6, 2025, which establishes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The bill intends to give this Executive Order the full force of law, potentially reshaping how the U.S. manages digital assets like Bitcoin.

The introduction of this legislation reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the financial landscape. As digital assets gain widespread acceptance, lawmakers seek to ensure that the U.S. maintains a strategic position in this evolving market. By formalizing the Executive Order, the bill aims to enhance regulatory clarity surrounding Bitcoin holdings and bolster the nation's economic strategy regarding digital currencies.

This legislative effort comes in response to heightened concerns regarding the global competitiveness of the U.S. as other nations, particularly in Asia and Europe, develop their own digital currency frameworks. Advocates suggest that establishing a strategic reserve could provide the U.S. with greater leverage in international trade and a stronger foothold in the global digital economy.

If enacted, this bill would not only affirm the government's commitment to digital currencies but also pave the way for further regulations and policies governing their use. The Financial Services Committee will hold hearings to discuss the implications of the proposed legislation, allowing stakeholders from various sectors to voice their perspectives.

As digital currency adoption grows, the bill is likely to spark discussions about the future role of cryptocurrencies within the U.S. financial system and their impact on traditional banking. The outcome of this legislation may significantly influence America's financial landscape for years to come.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2111",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces Bill to Exempt Premium Cigar Industry from Regulations","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced a new bill aimed at amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt the premium cigar industry from certain federal regulations. The legislation seeks to redefine what constitutes a tobacco product, specifically excluding premium cigars to ease regulatory burdens on this niche market.

The bill, introduced on March 14, 2025, comes in response to growing concerns among cigar enthusiasts and manufacturers about federal overreach affecting the premium cigar sector. Proponents argue that premium cigars are distinct from mass-produced tobacco products due to their unique characteristics and limited usage, with premium cigars accounting for only 1 percent of total cigar sales in the U.S. Most premium cigar manufacturers are small, family-owned businesses that primarily sell to adults in controlled environments like specialty shops and lounges.

Supporters of the bill highlight findings from a recent National Academies of Sciences report, which indicated that premium cigar use is significantly less common among youth and poses lower health risks compared to other types of tobacco. The legislation aims to align federal regulations with these findings and acknowledges that health concerns related to premium cigars are best addressed at the state level.

If passed, this bill could have substantial implications for the premium cigar industry, allowing businesses to operate with fewer restrictions while potentially boosting sales and preserving traditional practices in cigar manufacturing. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2110",40434,"Rep. Dingell Introduces Safe Vehicle Access for Survivors Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-MI, has introduced the Safe Vehicle Access for Survivors Act, a new legislative measure aimed at empowering survivors of domestic violence and related offenses to quickly terminate or disable access to connected vehicle services that may be misused by their abusers. The bill was officially introduced in the House on March 14, 2025, and referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee for review.

The motivation behind this bill stems from an increase in reports concerning the misuse of connected vehicle technologies by abusers to stalk or harass victims. With vehicles increasingly equipped with advanced connectivity features, the bill seeks to provide a defined process for survivors to protect themselves. Under the proposed legislation, survivors can initiate requests to disable connected services, ensuring that abusers lose access swiftly—typically within two business days.

This legislation is crucial for enhancing user safety, particularly in situations where a survivor might fear retaliation. It also emphasizes the need for confidentiality in the termination process, prohibiting vehicle service providers from requiring any onerous conditions or fees before granting access termination requests. By establishing protocols for handling such requests, the Safe Vehicle Access for Survivors Act aims to mitigate the risk of further violence while ensuring victims have control over their technological environments.

Currently, the bill has garnered support from various legislators, showing a united front in addressing the intersections of technology, personal safety, and domestic violence. If passed, this initiative could set a precedent for how technology companies manage user safety and privacy, paving the way for more comprehensive protections for individuals vulnerable to abuse.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2109",40434,"Rep. Davis Introduces Cybersecurity for Rural Water Systems Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Donald Davis, D-NC, has introduced the Cybersecurity for Rural Water Systems Act aimed at strengthening cybersecurity measures in rural water systems across the United States. This legislation seeks to enhance technical assistance within the national rural water and wastewater circuit rider program, ensuring that smaller systems are better equipped to protect against increasing cyber threats.

The bill is a response to the growing vulnerabilities that rural water systems face in an increasingly digitized world. With many of these systems serving populations of fewer than 10,000 people, they often lack the resources and expertise to defend against cyberattacks, which can disrupt water operations and threaten public health. Under the proposed law, the program would be expanded to include specific cybersecurity technical assistance, including assessments of current systems and implementation of protective measures.

By allocating $32.5 million for fiscal years 2026 through 2030, with $7.5 million specifically earmarked for cybersecurity technical support, the legislation underscores the critical need for rural communities to safeguard their water services. Cybersecurity breaches in this sector could lead to severe consequences, impacting not just infrastructure but also the communities relying on clean, reliable water sources.

The bill has been referred to the House Agriculture Committee, where it will be examined further. The introduction of this legislation highlights the federal government's recognition of cybersecurity as an essential component of public health infrastructure, particularly for under-resourced rural areas. As cyber threats continue to evolve, ensuring the security of vital services such as water supply is seen as increasingly important for community resilience and safety.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-IL, has introduced the TANF State Expenditure Integrity Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing accountability within the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This legislation addresses concerns surrounding the misuse of subrecipient funds intended to assist families in need.  

The initiative follows increasing scrutiny over financial irregularities in TANF funding allocations, which have been reported in various states. In light of these challenges, Rep. Davis's measure seeks to implement a framework for monitoring and ensuring the proper use of these funds, thereby safeguarding taxpayer dollars and restoring public trust in the welfare system.  

Key provisions of the bill include the establishment of a TANF Program Integrity Unit within the Administration for Children & Families. This unit will be responsible for overseeing subrecipient activities and conducting regular audits. By mandating states to report detailed usage data, the legislation aims to identify and rectify instances of intentional misuse of funds. Notably, the bill also outlines penalties for states that do not comply with its guidelines.  

Experts suggest that the proposed monitoring framework could enhance compliance and efficiency in the distribution of TANF funds, ultimately delivering more reliable support to families living below the poverty line. With rising costs of living, timely and properly managed financial assistance is more critical than ever.  

The TANF State Expenditure Integrity Act of 2025 has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation. The outcome of this legislation could set a precedent for how TANF funds are handled in the future, reinforcing the program's integrity and effectiveness in fulfilling its mission.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX, has introduced the Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education (GME) Support Reauthorization Act of 2025, aiming to secure federal funding for pediatric medical training at children's hospitals across the United States. The bill seeks to extend the current GME support program for an additional five years, allowing these institutions to continue training physicians specializing in the unique needs of children.

The reauthorization is critical as it ensures sustained financial assistance for teaching hospitals that play a pivotal role in developing the pediatric healthcare workforce. Under the proposed legislation, the funding amount would incrementally increase to a total of $261 million for graduate medical education over the next five years through fiscal year 2030. This funding is vital not only for operational costs but also for expanding residency programs that cater specifically to the requirements of children's healthcare.

The introduction of this bill comes against a backdrop of increasing concerns regarding the shortage of pediatric specialists nationwide, particularly in fields like pediatric surgery and child psychiatry. The reauthorization aims to mitigate these shortages, which have direct implications for the quality of healthcare that children receive. By bolstering training opportunities, the legislation hopes to equip more healthcare providers with the expertise necessary to address the diverse needs of young patients.

This bipartisan initiative is supported by several co-sponsors from both parties, reflecting a united front in addressing pediatric health concerns. The legislation not only underscores the importance of specialized training but also aims to enhance the overall quality of healthcare for America's children, ensuring they receive critical medical attention from a well-prepared and skilled workforce.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jim Costa, D-CA, has introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act, a legislative effort aimed at establishing a grant program to support schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine in underserved areas. This initiative seeks to address the growing healthcare disparities in regions lacking access to quality medical education.

The Expanding Medical Education Act was introduced in response to critical shortages of healthcare providers in rural and underserved communities across the United States. Currently, many areas face significant barriers in accessing medical care, largely due to a lack of local medical professionals. By funding the establishment and enhancement of medical educational institutions in these regions, the bill aims to cultivate a new generation of healthcare workers who are attuned to the specific needs of their communities.

Through this legislation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to award grants to institutions of higher education, prioritizing those that serve minority populations or establish campuses in regions where no medical school currently exists. The bill is particularly focused on recruiting and retaining students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which is vital in creating a healthcare workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation.

If passed, the Expanding Medical Education Act could significantly impact healthcare access in medically underserved communities, ultimately improving health outcomes. With rising concerns over public health and healthcare disparities, this proposal underscores the importance of investing in educational resources and infrastructure to bolster the medical workforce where it is most needed. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration and is a key step towards addressing the pressing healthcare staffing crisis.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the Preventing Illegal Weapons Trafficking Act to address the growing concern over the importation and proliferation of machinegun conversion devices. This legislation aims to enhance federal law enforcement's ability to detect, intercept, and eliminate illegal trafficking of these devices that can transform semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic weapons.

The bill responds to rising incidents involving machinegun conversion devices, which have increasingly been utilized in violent crimes. By establishing a comprehensive strategy for the prevention and interception of trafficking, the Act facilitates coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This collaborative approach is anticipated to optimize resource utilization and improve response efficacy against illegal firearms activities.

The proposed legislation mandates the Attorney General and other key officials to develop actionable strategies within 120 days of enactment, ensuring a swift response to the issue. Furthermore, it emphasizes the investigation and data collection regarding the origins of these devices to identify trafficking patterns and enable law enforcement to address the vulnerabilities in the system. Periodic updates on progress will be reported to Congress, fostering accountability and ongoing legislative oversight.

The introduction of this bill highlights a growing urgency to combat gun violence exacerbated by the accessibility of illegal weapons. With increasing public and political pressure for stricter gun control measures, Rep. Casten’s initiative could lead to significant legislative discourse on firearms regulation, potentially influencing future policies aimed at reducing weapon trafficking and enhancing community safety.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-IL, has introduced the Protect Postal Performance Act, designed to modify procedures governing the closure and consolidation of United States Postal Service (USPS) facilities. The legislation seeks to enhance public input in such decisions, aiming to protect critical postal services across the country.

The Protect Postal Performance Act was introduced in response to growing concerns over USPS closures, particularly in rural areas where post offices serve as vital community hubs. By requiring public hearings on proposed closures and summaries of community feedback, the bill aims to ensure that community voices are heard before significant decisions are made. 

Under the proposed legislation, no post office can be closed if it is the sole facility within a 15-mile radius or serves a community of over 15,000 individuals. Additionally, any changes to USPS processing and distribution centers would be subject to advisory opinions from the Postal Regulatory Commission, with specific operational benchmarks tied to delivery performance necessary for closure considerations. This layer of oversight aims to maintain service quality and accessibility, particularly in underserved regions of the country.

The bill has garnered bipartisan support, with several co-sponsors from various states highlighting its widespread relevance. As postal services face ongoing operational challenges and financial strain, this act is presented as a safeguard to ensure community connectivity and operational transparency. The introduction of the Protect Postal Performance Act marks a crucial step in legislative efforts to bolster postal services at a time when they are needed most. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian Babin, R-TX, has introduced the No Bailouts for Reparations Act, a bill aimed at prohibiting federal financial assistance to any state or local government that implements laws concerning reparations for slavery. The legislation, introduced on March 14, 2025, seeks to ensure that taxpayers are not responsible for financially supporting states that enact reparative measures related to slavery or racial issues.

The introduction of this bill comes amid an ongoing national conversation about reparations, sparked by a growing acknowledgment of historical injustices faced by African Americans. Proponents of reparations argue that these measures are necessary to address the lasting effects of systemic racism and discrimination. However, Babin's new legislation reflects concerns within certain factions of Congress that such reparative policies could create financial burdens on taxpayers and lead to increased government spending.

If enacted, the No Bailouts for Reparations Act would effectively block any loans, grants, or other forms of financial aid from the federal government or its agencies to those states implementing reparations programs. This move is seen as a direct challenge to the reparative actions that some local governments are considering, aimed at acknowledging past injustices.

As the national dialogue around reparations evolves, the bill raises significant questions about the role of federal intervention in state-level policy decisions. If passed, it could set a precedent for how financial aid is allocated and the implications of reparations discourse on federal-state relations. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is currently reviewing the bill for further considerations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-FL, has introduced the Major Richard Star Act, aimed at amending compensation policies for veterans with combat-related disabilities. This significant legislation seeks to enable concurrent receipt of veterans' disability compensation and retired pay for those who are disability retirees, addressing a long-standing issue affecting a substantial number of service members.

Currently, many veterans with combat-related disabilities are forced to choose between retirement pay and disability compensation due to overlapping policies. The proposed act is set to rectify this policy, allowing affected veterans to receive both forms of financial support simultaneously. This change is particularly important as many veterans face difficulties reintegrating into civilian life, and the financial burdens can further hinder their adjustment.

The introduction of the Major Richard Star Act comes amidst growing advocacy for veterans’ rights and fair compensation. Many proponents argue that those who served their country should not be penalized financially for their sacrifices. The act is named after Major Richard Star, a former Army officer and advocates for veterans who faced challenges related to disability payments.

The bill has been introduced amidst a rising awareness of the needs of veterans suffering from disabilities incurred through their service. As the number of veterans seeking assistance continues to grow, the Major Richard Star Act aims to streamline their access to benefits and enhance their quality of life. By enabling concurrent receipt, the act not only promises to provide financial relief but also recognizes the dual sacrifices made by these individuals.

Currently referred to the House Armed Services Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, the bill has gained support from a diverse group of representatives across party lines, signaling a united front in addressing veterans' issues. Its successful passage could mark a pivotal moment in veterans' benefits policy reform.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the Education, Achievement, and Opportunity Act, a legislative proposal aimed at providing tax relief for families with children attending public or private elementary and secondary schools. This bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow refundable tax credits for qualifying education expenses, effectively enhancing access to educational opportunities.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing concerns about the affordability of quality education for families across the United States. By proposing a tax credit of up to $10,000 per qualifying child, the legislation intends to ease the financial burden on parents and encourage choices that accommodate their children’s unique educational needs. The proposed credit would apply to tuition payments and certain education-related costs such as computers, tutoring, and special needs services.

Should this bill become law, it is expected to significantly impact families, particularly those with lower to middle-income levels. The legislation emphasizes parental choice in education, allowing families to select schools that best fit their children’s educational needs, whether they be public, charter, or private institutions.

The bill's provisions would not only support students' educational journeys but also aim to reduce the overall financial strain on households, leading to increased educational attainment and better long-term outcomes for children.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emergency Act of 2025 in response to the alarming increase in violent crime in Washington, D.C. The bill seeks to enhance law enforcement's ability to operate effectively by restoring collective bargaining rights for the Metropolitan Police Department and changing the statute of limitations for disciplinary actions against officers.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when Washington, D.C. has witnessed a significant spike in crime rates, with overall offenses rising by 30% compared to the previous year, including a 29% increase in homicides. The staffing crisis within the Metropolitan Police Department has compounded these challenges, with over 1,200 officers lost since 2020, reflecting the lowest personnel levels in over half a century.

According to the bill, restoring collective bargaining rights serves to ensure that law enforcement personnel are fairly treated and supported, which is essential for their retention and recruitment. The legislation aims to mitigate policies perceived as detrimental to officers' morale and effectiveness, thus fostering an environment conducive to effective policing.

The implications of the Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emergency Act extend beyond administrative changes; they signal a renewed commitment to combatting the surging violence within the capital. By addressing both personnel rights and operational capacities, the bill is framed as a necessary response to the urgent public safety concerns affecting residents and visitors alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the Postal Police Reform Act of 2025, aimed at redefining the role and responsibilities of United States Postal Service (USPS) police officers. This legislation is designed to enhance security measures specifically concerning postal property and to enforce regulatory compliance more effectively.

The Postal Police Reform Act comes in response to increasing concerns regarding safety and efficiency within USPS operations. Current statutes limit the scope of USPS police, which hampers their ability to address emerging threats and challenges adequately. By expanding their duties, the bill intends to empower these officers to better enforce regulations and protect postal facilities against potential violations.

This reform is projected to have a significant impact on both the operational efficiency of USPS and the safety of its employees and the public. The proposed amendments to Title 18 of the U.S. Code will allow the Postmaster General to create rules governing the use and protection of USPS property. Additionally, it introduces penalties for violations of said regulations, establishing a clearer legal framework for enforcement.

Historically, the role of USPS police has been overshadowed by other law enforcement entities, leading to a lack of clarity about their authority. This reform aims to rectify that oversight, resulting in a more streamlined approach to security within postal services. 

The bill was introduced on March 14, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committees on Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. As discussions advance, stakeholders await the potential enhancements in USPS policing capabilities, which may evolve into a significant pivot towards better protection of postal infrastructure across the country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John H. Rutherford, R-FL, has introduced the Homes for Every Local Protector, Educator, and Responder Act of 2025, aimed at establishing a mortgage insurance program for first responders. This bill proposes changes to the National Housing Act, providing vital assistance to individuals employed in roles such as law enforcement, firefighting, medical response, and education.

The HELPER Act responds to a growing need for affordable housing options among first responders, who often face challenges in homeownership due to high costs and financial instability. By creating an FHA mortgage insurance program specifically for these individuals, the bill aims to ease their path to homeownership by offering favorable terms such as zero down payments and the possibility of mortgages that cover up to 100% of the appraised value of a home.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-TX, has introduced the SPEAK Act of 2025 aimed at improving healthcare access for non-English speakers across the United States. This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a task force focusing on enhancing healthcare information technology services for individuals with limited English proficiency.

The SPEAK Act is a response to ongoing challenges faced by non-English speakers in accessing critical healthcare services. Reports indicate that language barriers can lead to misunderstandings between patients and healthcare providers, resulting in inadequate care.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY, has introduced the SAFE Bet Act of 2025, aimed at establishing minimum federal standards for sports betting across the United States. This legislation seeks to create a standardized regulatory framework to address concerns over gambling addiction and promote public health in the context of sports wagering.

The SAFE Bet Act was developed in response to the growing popularity of sports betting following the 2018 Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to legalize it. As various states implement their own betting laws, disparities and regulatory gaps have emerged, raising concerns about consumer protections and the risk of gambling addiction. The new bill proposes a comprehensive set of regulations designed to ensure fair play while safeguarding individuals susceptible to gambling disorders.

Among its key provisions, the SAFE Bet Act proposes the establishment of a national self-exclusion list, allowing individuals to voluntarily ban themselves from placing bets. It also mandates annual surveys be conducted to assess the scope of gambling-related harm, ensuring that problem gambling issues are tracked and addressed. The Act further stipulates stringent requirements for sports wagering operators, including background checks for employees and transparency in advertising, which will help protect vulnerable populations from aggressive marketing practices.

Moreover, the bill empowers the Attorney General to approve state sports wagering programs based on their compliance with federal standards. With enhanced consumer protections and public health measures, Rep. Tonko aims to create a regulated sports betting environment that encourages responsible gambling and ensures sincerity and integrity in the wagering sphere.

As the legislation moves through the House committees, proponents hope this comprehensive approach will serve as a model for balancing the economic benefits of legalized sports betting with crucial public health considerations.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2081",40434,"Rep. Sherrill Introduces Donut Dollies Congressional Gold Medal Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-NJ, has introduced the Donut Dollies Congressional Gold Medal Act to honor the remarkable contributions of the Red Cross Supplemental Recreational Activities Overseas (SRAO) program, also known as the Donut Dollies, who served during the Vietnam War. This proposed legislation aims to award a Congressional Gold Medal to those women who played a vital role in providing support and morale-boosting activities to U.S. servicemen in Vietnam.

The bill acknowledges the significant impact these women had during a challenging time in U.S. military history. Between 1962 and 1973, over 1,120 women volunteered with the Red Cross in Vietnam, traveling extensive distances to engage with American troops. Their contributions were vital in maintaining morale and providing companionship, often under dangerous conditions. Military commanders praised their efforts, recognizing them as essential support for the troops.

The Donut Dollies not only shared in the hardships of war, but some also faced perilous situations; tragically, several lost their lives while serving. This act of recognition serves to honor their bravery and commitment during a tumultuous era.

The proposed gold medal will be designed by the Secretary of the Treasury and displayed in the Smithsonian Institution for public viewing and research, ensuring that future generations appreciate the sacrifices made by the Donut Dollies. The bill has been referred to the House Financial Services and House Administration Committees for consideration.

Sherrill's initiative underscores the importance of acknowledging the often-overlooked contributions of women in military support roles, enhancing historical awareness and appreciation for their service.

The bill (H.R. 2081) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 13 co-sponsors: Rep. Houlahan, Chrissy [D-PA-6]...03/11/2025; Rep. Fitzpatrick, Brian K. [R-PA-1]...03/11/2025; Rep. Connolly, Gerald E.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2075",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced the Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act of 2025, aimed at prohibiting federal research involving human fetal tissue obtained from induced abortions. The bill reflects ongoing debates about bioethics in medical research and seeks to prevent federal funds from supporting such practices.

The legislation was prompted by concerns over the ethical implications of using fetal tissue in research. Proponents argue that the bill aligns with a growing sentiment among constituents who oppose the use of fetal tissue derived from abortions, emphasizing the need for ethical alternatives in scientific studies. The proposed act seeks to ensure that any research federally funded complies with these ethical standards.

Should the bill become law, its impact could be significant for the medical research community. It would effectively restrict access to a resource that has been utilized in various studies, including vaccine development and other health-related research. While the bill allows for research involving fetal tissue obtained after miscarriages or stillbirths, proponents fear this could hinder advancements in medical research that depend on fetal tissue. 

This action also reflects a stronger push from certain lawmakers in the current Congress toward policies that prioritize ethical considerations surrounding fetal tissue research. With multiple co-sponsors and referral to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act of 2025 underscores a contentious line of division within U.S. Congress regarding scientific research methods and their ethical implications.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2074",40434,"Rep. Newhouse Introduces POWER Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-WA, has introduced the Protecting Our Water Energy Resources Act, also known as the POWER Act, aimed at regulating the breaching of federally operated dams. The legislation seeks to prevent breaches unless specific conditions regarding environmental impact and economic factors are met.

The necessity for the POWER Act arises from growing concerns over the ecological and economic ramifications of dam breaches. With increasing discussions around energy transition and environmental protection, the bill emphasizes the importance of balancing these objectives with the needs of local communities reliant on rivers for transportation and agriculture. Under the proposed legislation, breaching a dam would require an assessment to ensure it does not lead to significant increases in carbon emissions or negatively affect navigability or product prices.

Further, the bill mandates that if a dam breach is considered, a detailed study must be conducted to analyze the area occupied by the dam and the potential environmental impacts. The act also stipulates that any energy sources intended as replacements must take up less space than the original dam.

Potential impacts of this legislation include preserving energy reliability, especially in states like Washington, Oregon, and California, where hydroelectric power is a significant energy source. If passed, the POWER Act would reinforce federal oversight over energy generation practices and potentially deter premature decommissioning of critical infrastructure.

The POWER Act has been referred to the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Natural Resources for further analysis and consideration. By introducing this bill, Rep. Newhouse aims to strike a balance between environmental stewardship and economic stability, addressing the complex challenges of energy policy in contemporary society.

The bill (H.R. 2074) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Baumgartner, Michael [R-WA-5]...03/11/2025; Rep. Fulcher, Russ [R-ID-1]...03/11/2025; Rep. Bentz, Cliff [R-OR-2]...03/11/2025.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2073",40434,"Rep. Newhouse Introduces Defending Our Dams Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-WA, has introduced the Defending Our Dams Act, a legislative measure aimed at prohibiting the use of federal funds for any studies or alterations involving the Lower Snake River dams. This initiative responds to growing concerns regarding possible changes to these critical infrastructures, which play a significant role in regional power supply and flood control.

The introduction of this bill follows ongoing debates about the dams' ecological impact and their role in salmon migration. Advocates for the dams argue that removing or altering them could negatively affect local economies relying on hydroelectric power and irrigation. By restricting federal affiliations with dam alteration studies, the bill seeks to ensure that local and regional interests remain directly involved in decisions that could drastically affect their livelihoods.

The Lower Snake River dams—Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite—were authorized under the 1945 Act and have historically been integral to the area’s infrastructure. Newhouse's bill articulates a clear position against any illegal or federally funded breaching or operational changes without the approval of the Secretary of the Army and the Bonneville Power Administration. This stipulation marks a significant step in affirming regional policy governance concerning local waterways.

The bill has been referred to both the Natural Resources and Transportation and Infrastructure committees for further examination. As climate change and ecological concerns continue to surface, the Defending Our Dams Act highlights the politically charged dialogue surrounding resource management and environmental stewardship in the Pacific Northwest. Proponents of the bill argue it will maintain a critical energy source while navigating the complexities of environmental responsibility.

The bill (H.R. 2073) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Baumgartner, Michael [R-WA-5]...03/11/2025; Rep. Fulcher, Russ [R-ID-1]...03/11/2025; Rep. Bentz, Cliff [R-OR-2]...03/11/2025.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2071",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces Clean Water Accessibility Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Water Accessibility Act, aimed at improving access to clean drinking water for underserved communities across the nation. The proposed legislation seeks to allocate federal funding to enhance water infrastructure and ensure that all Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have access to safe and reliable drinking water.

The Clean Water Accessibility Act has been introduced in response to escalating concerns about water quality in lower-income neighborhoods, particularly following high-profile cases of lead contamination and aging infrastructure issues in cities like Flint, Michigan. By addressing these critical gaps, the bill aims to reduce health disparities linked to inadequate water access, which disproportionately affects marginalized populations.

Furthermore, this legislation will empower local governments to modernize their water systems, replacing corroded pipes and implementing advanced purification technologies. Through these measures, Rep. Smith's proposal intends not only to address immediate water safety concerns but also to foster long-term sustainability in water management. With an estimated budget of $500 million allocated for grants to municipalities, the bill is expected to stimulate local economies while promoting public health.

In a broader context, the Clean Water Accessibility Act aligns with ongoing national efforts to combat climate change and environmental injustice. As climate-related challenges intensify, the legislation recognizes that access to clean water is a fundamental right that should be prioritized. Supporters believe that this bill could serve as a turning point in environmental policy, encouraging a more equitable distribution of resources and promoting healthier lifestyles for all citizens.

As discussions around the bill progress in Congress, advocates are urging swift action to ensure that clean drinking water becomes a reality for every American, irrespective of their community's financial standing.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2054",40434,"Rep. Hamadeh Introduces VOTE Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Abraham Hamadeh, R-AZ, has introduced the Voting Only Through English Act, also known as the VOTE Act, aimed at restricting Federal funding to states that provide ballots in languages other than English for federal elections. This legislation is designed to reinforce English as the primary language used in voting processes across the United States.

The introduction of the VOTE Act is motivated by concerns over the integrity and simplicity of the electoral process. Proponents argue that allowing ballots in multiple languages could lead to confusion among voters and complicate the administration of elections. By mandating that states use only English in their election materials, the bill seeks to ensure a uniform approach to voting that reduces the risk of misinterpretation.

If passed, the act would prohibit states from receiving certain federal funds used for election administration during any fiscal year in which ballots include non-English text. This could significantly impact states' budgets, especially those with high populations of non-English speakers who may rely on translated materials to participate effectively in elections. Critics of the bill express concern that it could disenfranchise voters who may not be proficient in English, thereby undermining democratic participation.

The VOTE Act revises provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, eliminating requirements that allow for non-English ballots. This move has sparked a heated debate regarding language rights and access to voting among diverse populations in the U.S.

As the legislative process unfolds, the VOTE Act will be considered by the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on House Administration. Observers from both sides of the aisle are eagerly watching how this proposal will evolve and whether it will garner sufficient support to advance.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2049",40434,"Rep. Gillen Introduces Access to Family Building Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Laura Gillen, D-NY, has introduced the Access to Family Building Act, legislation aimed at ensuring equitable access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for individuals seeking fertility treatment. The bill seeks to eliminate undue restrictions on these services, thereby facilitating a supportive environment for family planning and reproductive health.

The Access to Family Building Act is motivated by growing concerns over limited access to fertility treatments, which can be exacerbated by stringent regulations and insurance policies. As many individuals and couples struggle with infertility, this bill emphasizes the need for comprehensive medical care without excessive barriers, promoting the principle that reproductive health services should be as accessible as other medical procedures.

This legislation has the potential to significantly impact thousands of families looking to expand their households through ART. By prohibiting restrictions that are deemed burdensome or that do not advance reproductive health, the bill addresses financial and logistical barriers that currently hinder patients' access to necessary care. Additionally, it could set a precedent for how reproductive health is treated under law, advancing patient rights and healthcare provider responsibilities.

The Access to Family Building Act includes protections for both patients and healthcare providers, ensuring that they can access and provide ART services without the imposition of prohibitive regulations. It also allows the Attorney General to take action against any state or entity that implements restrictive measures, thereby reinforcing the bill's commitment to safeguarding healthcare access.

Introduced on March 11, 2025, the bill is currently referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration, signaling a significant step towards reforming reproductive healthcare in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2048",40434,"Rep. Garbarino Introduces Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, introduced the Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act, aiming to improve access to critical healthcare for patients with metastatic breast cancer. This legislation seeks to eliminate waiting periods for both disability insurance benefits and Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with this severe condition.

The introduction of the bill highlights a growing concern about the delays faced by patients in accessing their benefits, particularly those suffering from life-threatening illnesses. Currently, individuals with metastatic breast cancer must endure lengthy waiting periods that can hinder their timely access to necessary medical treatments and financial support. By removing these delays, the legislation aims to ensure that patients receive prompt medical attention and financial assistance when it is most needed.

Garbarino's bill specifically amends title II of the Social Security Act, broadening the scope of qualifying conditions for immediate access to benefits. By including metastatic breast cancer alongside other serious conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the act emphasizes the urgent need to prioritize patients facing advanced cancer stages.

The potential impact of this bill could be significant; it may alleviate financial burdens on affected families and provide timely treatment options that can improve survival rates. According to advocates, quicker access to Medicare and disability benefits could help level the playing field for patients who otherwise might struggle with the high costs of care amidst their battle with cancer.

The Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act is a crucial step toward addressing disparities in healthcare access for cancer patients. If passed, the legislation would serve as a model for future policies aimed at ensuring that all individuals battling life-threatening conditions receive the care and support they deserve without unnecessary delays.

The bill (H.R. 2048) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Castor, Kathy [D-FL-14]...03/11/2025; Rep. Fitzpatrick, Brian K. [R-PA-1]...03/11/2025; Rep. Chu, Judy [D-CA-28]...03/11/2025.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2047",40434,"Rep. Fletcher Introduces Pink Tariffs Study Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-TX, has introduced the Pink Tariffs Study Act, aimed at investigating the gender disparities and regressiveness of U.S. tariff rates on imported goods. This legislation tasks the Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies with conducting a comprehensive analysis of how tariff burdens affect consumers differently based on gender and income levels.

The impetus for this bill stems from concerns that current tariff structures disproportionately impact women and low-income households. By examining how certain consumer goods—including everyday items often purchased by women—face higher tariff rates than luxury goods, the study seeks to illuminate potential systemic biases in trade policy. Such biases could reinforce existing inequalities, affecting low-income families disproportionately.

The study will focus on several key areas: the regressive nature of tariffs, the impact of gender on importation costs, and various demographic considerations such as household types and income levels. The findings are expected to provide insights that could inform future trade policies and tariff reforms.

Fletcher's proposal arrives at a time when there is increasing awareness about the implications of taxation and tariffs on different demographics. Advocates suggest that understanding these impacts is crucial for crafting equitable economic policies that support all citizens. In a country where women often bear the brunt of rising living costs, this bill aims to bring transparency to a system that may unintentionally favor wealthier consumers.

The Pink Tariffs Study Act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, where it will be discussed alongside related economic policies. As Congress continues to grapple with issues of equity in economic practices, this legislation could pave the way for significant reforms in how tariffs are viewed and applied in the United States.

The bill (H.R. 2047) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 9 co-sponsors: Rep. Pettersen, Brittany [D-CO-7]...03/11/2025; Rep. Beyer, Donald S. [D-VA-8]...03/11/2025; Rep. Veasey, Marc A.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2045",40434,"Rep. Doggett Introduces Medicare Dental, Vision, and Hearing Benefit Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-TX, has introduced the Medicare Dental, Vision, and Hearing Benefit Act of 2025, a landmark piece of legislation designed to expand Medicare coverage to include essential dental, vision, and hearing services. This initiative aims to address the significant gaps in healthcare access faced by seniors and individuals with disabilities, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.

The proposed legislation arises from a growing recognition of the critical need for comprehensive healthcare services among older adults, who often face financial hardships due to costly out-of-pocket expenses for dental and vision care. According to studies, nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no dental coverage, while millions forego routine eye exams and hearing aids due to costs. This bill intends to alleviate those barriers by providing essential services that many deem as necessary yet unaffordable under the current Medicare framework.

If passed, the Act would amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, formally incorporating dental, vision, and hearing care into Medicare benefits. The bill outlines specific coverage details for preventive and basic oral health services, vision examinations, and audiology services. Notably, adjustments would include 100% coverage for preventive services in 2026, with increasing percentages for additional treatments in subsequent years to ensure comprehensive care.

The potential impact of this legislation is profound, promising to significantly reduce healthcare disparities while improving overall health outcomes for aging Americans. As the senior population continues to grow rapidly, advocates strongly support enhancing Medicare's offerings to better meet their needs. With more than 120 co-sponsors already backing the bill, momentum is building for a substantial shift in healthcare policy that transcends traditional boundaries.

The bill (H.R. 2045) introduced on 03/11/2025 has 122 co-sponsors.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2036",40434,"Rep. Carey Introduces Credit for Caring Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Carey, R-OH, has introduced the Credit for Caring Act, aimed at providing financial relief to working family caregivers. This bill, presented to Congress on March 11, 2025, proposes a tax credit to ease the financial burden on caregivers who are also employed, acknowledging the significant expenses incurred while caring for qualified recipients.

The Credit for Caring Act was introduced in response to the growing recognition of the challenges faced by family caregivers, who often juggle work responsibilities with caregiving duties. Many find themselves financially strained due to costs associated with providing care, such as medical expenses, caregiving supplies, and lost wages from time taken off work. By offering a tax credit of up to $5,000 per year for qualifying expenses exceeding $2,000, the bill seeks to acknowledge and support these caregivers.

Under the proposed legislation, eligible caregivers must have earned income above $7,500 and incur expenses related to caring for individuals with long-term care needs. This includes spouses and family members requiring assistance with basic daily activities. The legislation not only aims to reduce financial stress on caregivers but also to encourage individuals to continue working while providing essential support to their loved ones.

As the aging population increases and more individuals require long-term care, the Credit for Caring Act could significantly impact many families across the nation. Supporters believe that this initiative is a crucial step toward recognizing the vital role that family caregivers play in both the healthcare system and the workforce, ultimately promoting greater balance between work and caregiving responsibilities. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicholas Begich, R-AK, has introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025, aiming to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the U.S. government. This legislation seeks to ensure transparent management of federal Bitcoin holdings while leveraging these assets to offset costs through measures involving the Federal Reserve.

The BITCOIN Act responds to the growing significance of digital assets in the global economy, positioning Bitcoin as a modern store of value akin to gold. By creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Act intends to enhance national financial security and innovation. It mandates the purchase of 1 million Bitcoins over five years, emphasizing a transparent acquisition approach to minimize market disruption.

The bill proposes a decentralized network of storage facilities to safeguard these assets, ensuring geographical diversity to reduce risks. Furthermore, it sets forth security measures to protect against unauthorized access. The long-term goal includes a minimum holding period of 20 years for the acquired Bitcoin, reinforcing stability in federal financial management.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, aiming not only to bolster U.S. economic resilience but also to reinforce the dollar's position in a digital world. The Act also facilitates public scrutiny through quarterly reports on Bitcoin investments, assuring taxpayers of accountability in managing these volatile assets.

As the U.S. government contemplates expanding its digital asset portfolio, the BITCOIN Act could pave the way for innovative financial strategies that mitigate risks associated with economic instability. With growing bipartisan support, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services and signals a critical step toward integrating digital currency into national financial policy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark Alford, R-MO, has introduced the Returning SBA to Main Street Act, aiming to transfer 30 percent of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) headquarters staff to various locations outside the Washington metropolitan area. This proposed relocation seeks to enhance outreach to local businesses and strengthen the SBA's presence in regional markets.

This legislation was prompted by concerns that the SBA remains too centralized in Washington, limiting its effectiveness to help small businesses across the country. By dispersing personnel, supporters argue, the agency can better understand and respond to the unique needs of entrepreneurs operating in diverse geographical areas, especially in rural economies. 

The act intends to preserve fiscal responsibility, as the SBA Administrator will need to substantiate that the relocation will reduce operational costs. Additionally, the plan includes significant reductions to headquarters office space to align with the new staffing approach. This measure reflects an increased commitment to provide in-person support and customer services, aiming to bolster the economic landscape of smaller communities.

Ultimately, the act could lead to reshaped employee roles and responsibilities within the SBA, alongside potential impacts on recruitment strategies and workplace dynamics. The intent is to encourage a workforce that is more connected to the regions they serve, thereby promoting greater inclusivity and awareness of local business challenges.

The Returning SBA to Main Street Act has been referred to the House Committee on Small Business, where discussions regarding its provisions will further evolve. This bill represents a significant shift in how the SBA operates, potentially setting a precedent for federal agency practices aimed at invigorating small businesses across America.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2023",40434,"Rep. Underwood Introduces Women's Retirement Protection Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-IL, has introduced the Women's Retirement Protection Act, aimed at enhancing spousal protections in defined contribution retirement plans. The bill is designed to address long-standing disparities in retirement security among women, particularly in light of the significant income inequities they face throughout their careers.

The introduction of this bill comes as studies reveal alarming statistics about women’s financial preparedness for retirement. Approximately 28% of non-retired adults reportedly lack any defined benefit or retirement savings plan, and women, who often earn less and face higher poverty rates in old age, are disproportionately affected. Research indicates that women aged 80 and older represent the highest poverty rate among seniors, emphasizing the urgent need for legislative action.

The Women's Retirement Protection Act seeks to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by instituting rigorous spousal consent requirements for withdrawals and loans from defined contribution plans. This could potentially secure women's financial interests, particularly in the event of divorce, where retirement savings are commonly a major asset. Current provisions in traditional defined benefit plans include spousal protections, but no such measures exist for defined contribution plans, which are becoming increasingly prevalent.

Moreover, the bill allocates grants aimed at improving financial literacy among women and aiding low-income women in obtaining necessary legal orders to access retirement benefits. With an authorization of up to $100 million allocated for these endeavors, the legislation strives to provide the necessary education and resources that empower women in achieving a stable retirement.

By addressing both the structural and educational gaps in retirement planning, Rep. Underwood's initiative could significantly improve financial outcomes for women, ensuring they have the support needed to secure their futures. As the bill moves to committee, its potential impact on widening retirement security for women remains a key point of focus among lawmakers and advocates alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emilia Strong Sykes, D-OH, has introduced the Feed Our Families Act, a crucial piece of legislation aimed at ensuring continued support for the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 during potential funding lapses. This bill seeks to allocate necessary appropriations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the first 90 days of any fiscal year when discretionary appropriations may be temporarily halted.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when economic uncertainties and budgetary constraints have raised significant concerns regarding food security for millions of American families. With the potential for government shutdowns looming, Rep. Sykes emphasized the importance of securing funding to prevent interruptions in access to vital nutritional assistance. This proactive measure aims to safeguard SNAP benefits that are essential for helping families put food on their tables.

The Feed Our Families Act is designed to ensure funds are immediately available for program operations upon any fiscal lapse. Should the bill pass, it will allow for the allocation of reserves that can be drawn upon without delay, thus maintaining the flow of resources during critical times. This legislative response highlights the urgent need to address food insecurity amid budget negotiations that may otherwise leave families vulnerable.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Appropriations, where it will undergo scrutiny before potentially advancing to the House floor. Supporters hope that bipartisan recognition of the importance of food assistance programs will pave the way for swift action. By reinforcing funding mechanisms, the Feed Our Families Act seeks not only to enhance the reliability of nutritional support for families but also to stabilize the economic welfare of communities across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has unveiled the Salary Transparency Act, aimed at enhancing wage transparency in the hiring process. This legislation seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act, requiring employers to disclose wage ranges for job openings, thereby fostering a more equitable labor market.

The Salary Transparency Act was introduced in response to persistent disparities in compensation that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. By mandating wage range disclosures, the act intends to empower both job seekers and current employees by ensuring they have access to critical compensation information. Proponents believe this will not only help individuals make informed career choices but also encourage employers to offer competitive salaries, thus promoting fairness across various sectors.

According to labor advocates, transparency in wage offerings is essential in addressing gender and racial wage gaps. With the implementation of this act, employers would be required to provide wage information at all stages of the employment process—from initial job postings to annual updates for existing staff, ensuring that all employees can engage in meaningful discussions regarding their compensation.

The potential impact of the legislation could be significant, as it introduces civil penalties for non-compliance and allows employees to seek legal recourse for violations. This aspect is designed to hold employers accountable and deter practices that have historically contributed to wage discrimination. 

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it reflects a growing sentiment among lawmakers and constituents alike regarding the importance of pay equity in achieving social justice. Advocates are hopeful that this bill will not only pass but also set a precedent for similar actions across the country, making wage transparency a standard practice in the workplace.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Cory Mills, R-FL, has introduced the Department of Government Efficiency Act, also known as the DOGE Act, which aims to codify Executive Order 14210. This legislation seeks to implement the President’s initiative for workforce optimization within the Department of Government Efficiency.

The DOGE Act was motivated by ongoing concerns regarding government efficiency and wastage. As various governmental bodies grapple with capability and resource management, this initiative is designed to streamline operations and improve service delivery. The bill emphasizes optimizing human resources, reducing redundancies, and enhancing the effectiveness of federal programs.

If passed, the DOGE Act will not only enhance administrative efficiency but also ensure that government functions are better aligned with modern workforce needs. By codifying the executive order, the legislation aims to formalize the strategies established by the administration, binding them into law to provide a more systematic approach to government operations.

Along with Rep. Mills, several co-sponsors, including prominent representatives from Florida and Alabama, have rallied in support of the bill. Their backing underscores a shared belief in the necessity of enhancing governmental effectiveness to meet contemporary challenges.

Historically, the introduction of such efficiency reforms has received bipartisan support, given that constituents from all political spectrums demand accountable governance. As bipartisan dialogue continues around issues of bureaucracy and spending, the DOGE Act could pave the way for more nuanced discussions on enhancing federal management.

This legislative effort comes at a critical time when many federal agencies are facing budget constraints and evolving public expectations. The DOGE Act is poised to provide a pathway for meaningful improvements, resonating with principles of both fiscal responsibility and public service.

"$H billintroh-250310-hr2004",40434,"Rep. Lieu Introduces Tyler’s Law","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, has introduced Tyler’s Law, aimed at improving the screening process for patients experiencing drug overdoses in hospital emergency departments. The proposed legislation seeks to establish guidelines for whether routine fentanyl testing should be implemented as a standard practice in such scenarios.

The initiative comes in response to rising concerns about opioid overdoses, particularly related to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Recent statistics indicate that fentanyl is involved in a significant percentage of overdose deaths, underscoring the urgency for effective testing protocols. Current emergency department practices may not adequately account for the presence of fentanyl, leading to delayed or ineffective treatment.

If enacted, Tyler’s Law would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a comprehensive study. This assessment would analyze existing practices, the costs associated with fentanyl testing, and the potential implications for patient privacy and care. Following the study's completion, the Secretary would provide guidance on whether hospitals should adopt routine fentanyl testing based on the findings.

The potential impact of this bill is considerable, with proponents arguing it could lead to faster and more accurate treatment for overdose patients. By standardizing testing procedures, hospitals may enhance their ability to manage acute drug overdoses effectively, ultimately saving lives.

Tyler’s Law has garnered bipartisan support, reflecting a collective recognition of the opioid crisis's urgency. With this legislative effort, Rep. Lieu aims to facilitate better healthcare responses, thereby addressing a critical aspect of public health amidst escalating overdose incidents.

"$H billintroh-250310-hr2002",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces MATCH IT Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kelly, R-PA, has introduced the MATCH IT Act of 2025, a groundbreaking bill aimed at improving patient matching within the healthcare system. The bill seeks to establish national standards and protocols to ensure that patients are accurately matched with their medical records, addressing a critical issue that affects patient safety and healthcare costs.

The MATCH IT Act was introduced in response to growing concerns about misidentification in medical records, which can lead to medical errors, safety threats, and unnecessary costs. Current estimates suggest that patient match rates can fall as low as 80%, meaning healthcare providers may struggle to correctly identify one in five patients. This ineffective matching not only complicates patient care but can also result in extensive financial losses. The bill aims to rectify these shortcomings and enhance the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.

If passed, the legislation would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a uniform definition of patient match rate and establish minimum data sets necessary for robust patient matching across healthcare settings. Furthermore, it would mandate regular updates to these standards to reflect technological advancements.

In addition to promoting interoperability, the MATCH IT Act would also incentivize healthcare providers to achieve accurate patient matching rates, which could lead to significant cost savings and improved patient experiences. With healthcare expenditures linked to misidentification exceeding $6.7 billion annually, the act could represent a pivotal step in reforming patient data management practices.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it is expected to receive scrutiny from health professionals and stakeholders keen on improving patient care outcomes while reducing unnecessary expenditures in the system.

The bill (H.R. 2002) introduced on 03/10/2025 has 8 co-sponsors: Rep. Foster, Bill [D-IL-11]...03/10/2025; Rep. Moulton, Seth [D-MA-6]...03/10/2025; Rep. Davis, Donald G. [D-NC-1]...03/18/2025; Del.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Finstad, R-MN, has introduced the Producer and Agricultural Credit Enhancement Act aimed at improving financial support for farmers and ranchers. This legislation intends to modify existing loan limits for farm ownership and operating loans, ultimately bolstering access to credit for agricultural producers.

The bill proposes to increase the caps on farm ownership loans from $600,000 to $850,000 and operating loans from $400,000 to $750,000, significantly enhancing funding opportunities for American farmers. It also allows for higher amounts on loans guaranteed by the Secretary of Agriculture, moving from $1.75 million to $3.5 million for ownership loans, thus helping more substantial farming operations secure necessary funds.

This legislation responds to ongoing concerns about the financial pressures faced by agricultural producers, exacerbated by rising costs of inputs and inflationary pressures. By raising loan limits, the bill seeks to accommodate the evolving economic landscape and rising operational costs for farmers, thereby supporting the stability of U.S. agriculture.

In addition to adjusting loan limits, the bill includes provisions for refinancing guaranteed loans into direct loans, which would assist struggling farmers facing financial distress. This regulatory measure is designed to protect taxpayer funds while providing farmers another avenue for financial relief.

As agriculture remains a pivotal sector for the U.S. economy, this initiative aims to ensure that farmers and ranchers have the resources they need to thrive. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture for further consideration, with advocates highlighting its potential to strengthen rural economies and support family farms across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-MD, has introduced the Protect Our Probationary Employees Act, aiming to support federal employees who are terminated during their probationary period. The legislation allows these workers to resume their probation if they are reinstated, addressing job security and the well-being of government staff.

The bill was introduced in response to concerns about the vulnerability of probationary employees, who often face termination without the protection afforded to permanent federal workers. Since employees can be dismissed without formal cause during their probationary period, this legislation seeks to ensure that those reinstated after a wrongful dismissal can complete their probation as intended. This adaptation is crucial for workers who might otherwise face devastating career setbacks due to circumstances beyond their control.

If passed, this act could significantly impact federal employment practices, promoting a fairer approach toward probationary employment across government agencies. By reinstating employees' probationary status, the legislation recognizes the importance of giving individuals a second chance to demonstrate their qualifications and capabilities. 

The bill, with support from a diverse group of 63 co-sponsors, underscores a growing recognition of the need for reform within federal employment. It has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration, and if enacted, will remain in effect until January 20, 2029. The Protect Our Probationary Employees Act could serve as a pivotal step in reforming employment practices to safeguard the rights and livelihoods of government workers.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-TX, has introduced legislation to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 620 East Pecan Boulevard in McAllen, Texas, as the Agent Raul H.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Veteran Education Assistance Adjustment Act to amend the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program. The legislation aims to provide an annual increase in stipends for educational costs, such as books and supplies, for veterans pursuing higher education.

The bill is a response to rising educational expenses faced by veterans, which have not kept pace with inflation. Currently, the monthly stipend is set at $1,000, a figure that has remained unchanged. Under this new proposal, it will be increased to $1,400. Additionally, the legislation stipulates that future increases will be linked to the Consumer Price Index, reflecting the rising costs of living and educational materials, ensuring that veterans receive adequate financial support throughout their studies.

This initiative is crucial for addressing the financial burdens many veterans encounter when transitioning to civilian life. With education being a vital component of this transition, accessibility to necessary resources can significantly impact their success. The bill seeks to empower veterans to pursue higher education without the constant stress of financial limitations.

Moreover, the act signals a commitment from lawmakers to prioritize the well-being of those who have served in the military. In recent years, there has been a growing acknowledgment of the need for enhanced support systems for veterans, particularly in education and job training. By ensuring that veterans receive timely financial assistance, this legislation could play a pivotal role in fostering a successful and smooth transition to civilian life.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-TX, has introduced legislation aimed at enhancing governmental accountability and transparency regarding the financial implications of major federal regulations. Known as the Agency Accountability and Cost Transparency Act of 2025, this bill mandates federal agency heads to confirm whether proposed major rules are budget neutral before implementation.

The need for this bill arises from growing calls for transparency in how agencies regulate and their impact on the economy. Major rules, which are defined as those likely to affect the economy by $100 million or more, must be accompanied by an estimate of costs and a statement addressing potential rules that may need to be repealed to offset new regulations. This is designed to prevent regulatory overreach and ensure that new policies do not impose excessive financial burdens on the public while maintaining government predictability and reliability.

According to Van Duyne, prior experience indicates that government oversight in regulatory processes can lead to significant unintended economic impacts. If passed, the legislation could foster a more structured approach to regulation, promoting a culture of accountability among federal agencies and aiding Congress in its oversight duties.

The bill requires agency heads to publicly disclose whether a major rule is budget neutral, thus providing citizens and lawmakers with crucial insights into how regulations affect their finances. Advocates for the bill believe that by enforcing stricter protocols on the economic evaluations of federal rules, the government will encourage more responsible regulatory development.

As the bill moves to the House Judiciary Committee for review, its proponents anticipate strong support for enhancing the efficiency and accountability of federal regulatory processes in a politically sensitive environment.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bobby Scott, D-VA, has introduced the Do No Harm Act, legislation aimed at amending the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) to better ensure the protection of civil rights and prevent harm to third parties. This bill seeks to clarify that federal laws providing protections against discrimination, equal opportunity, and health care access should take precedence over RFRA claims that could allow for discriminatory practices.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns that RFRA has been misused to justify discrimination under the guise of religious freedom. Advocates argue that this misuse has led to harmful impacts on marginalized communities, especially regarding access to healthcare and employment opportunities. The Do No Harm Act aims to close loopholes in RFRA that have allowed individuals and organizations to claim religious exemptions that ultimately harm others.

The bill outlines specific exceptions, ensuring that federal laws protecting civil rights are not compromised. It asserts that RFRA should not apply when federal laws are intended to provide protections against discrimination or promote equal opportunities, referencing existing legislation like the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. This legislative move is expected to have significant implications for how religious exemptions are interpreted and applied in various contexts, particularly in areas affecting healthcare access for vulnerable populations.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on the Judiciary, its potential to reshape the conversation around religious freedom and civil rights is already becoming a pivotal topic in Congress. The Do No Harm Act reflects an ongoing effort to balance the rights to religious expression with the necessity of safeguarding the liberties and rights of all individuals in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1945",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces America's National Churchill Museum National Historic Landmark Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced a bill aimed at designating America’s National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, as a National Historic Landmark. This initiative seeks to enhance the preservation and educational outreach of the museum, which recognizes the legacy of Winston Churchill and his pivotal role in history.

The bill, introduced on March 6, 2025, signifies a commitment to protecting the museum's historic resources and facilitating its educational programs. By achieving National Historic Landmark status, the museum would gain greater visibility and federal support to maintain its facilities and promote public engagement. The legislation proposes cooperative agreements that would allow the Secretary of the Interior to partner with local entities and organizations to ensure the museum's preservation.

The designation represents a response to the increasing recognition of the museum's significance in American cultural and historical education. By elevating its status, the bill aims to attract more visitors, scholars, and historians, facilitating enhanced research and understanding of Churchill’s influence on the United States. The overall goal is to ensure that this institution continues to thrive as a center for education on transatlantic relations and democratic ideals.

Furthermore, the bill calls for a special resource study by the Secretary of the Interior. This study will evaluate the landmark's national significance and assess the feasibility of designating it as a unit of the National Park System, exploring potential funding for its operation and maintenance. Ultimately, this legislative move exemplifies a dedication to honoring historical narratives and highlights the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations.

The bill (H.R. 1945) was introduced on 03/06/2025.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1934",40434,"Rep. Lieu Introduces ProTECT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, has introduced the Prohibiting Threatened and Endangered Creature Trophies Act of 2025, commonly referred to as the ProTECT Act, aimed at amending the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This legislation seeks to prohibit the trophy hunting of any endangered or threatened species of fish and wildlife within the United States and outlaw the importation of endangered and threatened species trophies into the country.

The ProTECT Act was sparked by concerns that trophy hunting can severely undermine conservation efforts, particularly by targeting the largest and strongest members of wildlife populations, which disrupts genetic diversity and reproductive dynamics. This practice has been shown to increase poaching activities, threatening the survival of already at-risk species. Additionally, the bill aims to eliminate the legal markets that can provide cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, a lucrative underground industry valued at up to $20 billion annually.

This legislation addresses a significant loophole in the current Endangered Species Act, where protections do not automatically extend to threatened species. The ProTECT Act would ensure that both endangered and threatened species receive equal protection, thereby enhancing efforts to conserve these vulnerable populations.

By introducing this bill, Rep. Lieu is responding to a growing public demand for stronger wildlife protection measures in the face of mounting threats from habitat loss and climate change. The implications of the ProTECT Act could set a precedent for wildlife management policy, reinforcing the United States' commitment to global biodiversity conservation. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further review and discussion.

The bill (H.R. 1934) introduced on 03/06/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Nadler, Jerrold [D-NY-12]...03/06/2025; Rep. Johnson, Henry C. ""Hank"" [D-GA-4]...03/06/2025; Del.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1928",40434,"Rep. Issa Introduces Sanctuary City Accountability Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, has introduced the Sanctuary City Accountability Act, a legislation aimed at empowering individuals to take legal action against so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. The bill allows U.S. nationals to sue these jurisdictions if an undocumented immigrant commits a crime against them or their immediate family members.

The Sanctuary City Accountability Act emerges amidst rising tensions surrounding immigration policies across the country. Advocates argue that sanctuary policies hinder law enforcement’s ability to maintain public safety, while critics highlight the potential for racial profiling and misuse of the legal system. By enabling private enforcement, this bill seeks to hold local governments accountable for their immigration policies and practices that prevent communication with federal immigration officers.

If passed, the bill could significantly alter the landscape of immigration enforcement, allowing individuals direct recourse against local governments. It defines “sanctuary jurisdictions” as areas resisting compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers and other federal directives. The potential legal ramifications are substantial, with implications for community relations, local law enforcement, and the broader discourse around immigration policy in America.

This legislation highlights the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement in the U.S. and the authority of local versus federal governments. As immigrant populations continue to grow, and sanctuary cities remain contested battlegrounds, the Sanctuary City Accountability Act could spark further political and legal battles. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, where it will be evaluated and debated.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1920",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces Clean Energy Incentive Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Incentive Act, aiming to bolster investment in renewable energy sources while reducing carbon emissions nationwide. The proposed legislation seeks to provide tax incentives for individuals and businesses that invest in solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns about climate change and its related effects on public health and the economy. Over recent years, California has experienced devastating wildfires and extreme weather patterns attributed to climate fluctuations. As lawmakers seek sustainable solutions, the Clean Energy Incentive Act is positioned to encourage a shift towards greener alternatives, lessening the reliance on fossil fuels.

If passed, the bill is expected to stimulate job growth in the renewable energy sector. By incentivizing clean technology investments, proponents anticipate the creation of thousands of new jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of solar panels and wind turbines. This aligns with broader economic goals of transitioning to a green economy, thus promising not only environmental benefits but also economic revitalization.

Furthermore, the bill proposes to make renewable energy accessible to low-income households through subsidies and funding for community programs. This aspect aims to ensure that the transition to clean energy technologies does not exclude economically disadvantaged segments of the population, promoting equity in energy usage and investment.

The Clean Energy Incentive Act, should it gain bipartisan support, could mark a significant step towards achieving the nation’s climate goals, making substantial strides in lowering carbon emissions, and ultimately fostering a healthier environment for future generations.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1918",40434,"Rep. Doggett Introduces Farewell to Foam Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-TX, has introduced the Farewell to Foam Act of 2025, a bill that aims to prohibit the sale and distribution of expanded polystyrene food service ware, loose fill, and coolers in the United States by January 1, 2028. The legislation addresses growing concerns about environmental pollution caused by expanded polystyrene, commonly known as foam.

The introduction of this legislation comes in the wake of increasing public and governmental pressure to reduce single-use plastics, which contribute to significant environmental issues like ocean pollution and landfill overflow. Foam products are particularly problematic due to their non-biodegradable properties, which can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. By targeting these specific items, the Farewell to Foam Act aims to mitigate the detrimental impacts of foam waste on wildlife and ecosystems. 

In addition to improving environmental health, the bill seeks to promote the use of sustainable alternatives. Food service providers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers found in violation of the proposed ban would first receive written notification, and subsequent violations could lead to fines escalating to $1,000. This enforcement mechanism encourages compliance while prioritizing education over punitive measures initially.

With over 70 co-sponsors, the initiative reflects a growing bipartisan recognition of environmental issues. Some states and municipalities have already implemented similar bans in an effort to reduce foam usage, showcasing a trend that could extend nationally if the bill passes. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, advocates will be watching closely to measure its potential impact on environmental policies at the federal level.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1910",40434,"Rep. Casten Introduces Chief Risk Officer Enforcement and Accountability Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the Chief Risk Officer Enforcement and Accountability Act, aimed at enhancing risk management in large financial institutions. This legislation stipulates that certain significant banking organizations must appoint a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to oversee risk management practices. The bill seeks to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010, reinforcing accountability and oversight in the financial sector.

The introduction of this act comes amid rising concerns about the potential risks posed by large financial firms, particularly in light of past financial crises that highlighted vulnerabilities within the banking system. By mandating that these institutions appoint a qualified CRO, the bill aims to ensure enhanced oversight of risk management practices, promoting a culture of transparency and responsibility within the financial industry. 

The CRO will be tasked with creating and monitoring enterprise-wide risk limits, implementing governance policies, and ensuring compliance with risk-management protocols. Furthermore, the legislation outlines specific reporting responsibilities, requiring the CRO to directly report to both the company’s risk committee and its chief executive officer. These measures are designed to strengthen the risk management infrastructure and mitigate possible financial failures that could impact the wider economy.

This act reflects a growing recognition of the need for regulatory reforms in the financial sector, especially as the landscape continues to evolve with new challenges. As the bill moves through the legislative process, its proponents argue that empowering financial institutions with a dedicated risk officer is crucial for fostering a more stable and resilient banking environment.

The Chief Risk Officer Enforcement and Accountability Act has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration. Advocates hope that this initiative will lead to more robust risk management practices and ultimately strengthen the nation's financial system.

The bill (H.R. 1910) introduced on 03/06/2025 has 4 co-sponsors: Rep. Sherman, Brad [D-CA-32]...03/06/2025; Rep. Scott, David [D-GA-13]...03/06/2025; Rep. Green, Al [D-TX-9]...03/06/2025; Rep. Torres, Ritchie [D-NY-15]...03/06/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Burchett, R-TN, has introduced the Defense Against Drones Act, which aims to empower individuals to shoot down unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are perceived to be invading their property. The bill, introduced on March 6, 2025, seeks to address growing concerns over privacy and property rights amidst the increasing prevalence of drone usage.

The Defense Against Drones Act permits individuals to use legally obtained shotguns to shoot down drones flying lower than 200 feet above their property, provided they believe the drone poses a threat. This legislative move comes as public anxiety rises over unauthorized drone surveillance and potential accidents involving private property. Proponents argue that the bill is essential for maintaining individual privacy rights, while critics worry it could lead to recklessness and increased safety risks.

Should this legislation pass, its implications could be significant. Homeowners might feel more empowered to protect their privacy, potentially reducing illicit drone activities. However, the act raises questions about the regulation of airspace and firearm use in proximity to such unmanned vehicles. The measure also stipulates that individuals must report the incident to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within 60 days if they identify the drone's registration number, promoting accountability among drone operators.

As the drone industry expands, lawmakers are grappling with how to balance innovation and private property rights. The heightened public discourse surrounding drone usage underscores the need for legal clarity in this evolving landscape. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 1907) was introduced on 03/06/2025.

"$H billintroh-250306-hr1903",40434,"Rep. Beyer Introduces Congressional Trade Authority Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Donald S. Beyer, D-VA, has introduced the Congressional Trade Authority Act, aiming to limit presidential powers regarding the adjustment of imports perceived to threaten national security. This legislation seeks to amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, requiring stronger participation from Congress in trade-related decisions that impact America's security.

The bill responds to concerns raised over executive authority in trade policies that could have significant repercussions on the economy and national defense. Currently, the President can adjust imports based on national security assessments with minimal oversight. Beyer's initiative proposes that decisions affecting essential military equipment and energy sources must involve a joint resolution from Congress, ensuring a more balanced approach between the legislative and executive branches.

The potential impact of this bill could be substantial. By shifting responsibility for security assessments to the Secretary of Defense, the act emphasizes a strategic approach to imports that directly influence military and economic stability. This could reshape how the U.S. approaches international trade agreements and tariffs, potentially diminishing unilateral executive actions.

This legislative effort comes amidst heightened scrutiny of previous import adjustments, particularly those related to tariffs on steel and aluminum, which critics argue have influenced consumer prices. As trade tensions rise globally, the act symbolizes a proactive measure to reinforce congressional authority and accountability in matters of national security.

The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Ways and Means and Rules for further consideration. With bipartisan support from several co-sponsors, the Congressional Trade Authority Act seeks to redefine the balance of power, addressing concerns over the current administration's trade policies while fostering national security.

"$H billintroh-250305-hr1890",40434,"Rep. Schneider Introduces Turkey Diplomatic Realignment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bradley Schneider, D-IL, has introduced the Turkey Diplomatic Realignment Act, a legislative measure aimed at reshaping the U.S. diplomatic approach to Turkey by transitioning its oversight from the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs to the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs within the Department of State. This shift is intended to address Turkey's evolving geopolitical stance and its complex relationships in the Middle East.

The introduction of this bill corresponds with growing concerns about Turkey's distancing from the West, particularly regarding its foreign policy decisions that have aligned it more closely with non-Western countries such as Russia and China. The legislation recognizes Turkey's pivotal role at the intersection of Europe and the Middle East, noting its influence on multiple regional security dynamics and economic policies.

One of the significant motivations behind the bill is Turkey's gradual disengagement from European Union relations, exacerbated by delays in its accession talks and increasing human rights concerns. The reassignment of diplomatic oversight aims to realign U.S. strategy to better reflect Turkey's current diplomatic posture, which has included partnerships with Islamist groups and participation in conflicts across the region.

The proposed changes encapsulate a broader U.S. strategy to reassess its diplomatic engagement with Turkey. By officially acknowledging this shift, the U.S. seeks to promote internal discussions within Turkey regarding its foreign affiliations as it navigates its future in the regional order. The legislation requires a report to Congress within five years to evaluate the effectiveness of this administrative realignment and may lead to further recommendations concerning Turkey's diplomatic management.

This bill underscores the evolving nature of international relations and the need for adaptive foreign policy in response to changes in global geopolitical landscapes.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Moolenaar, R-MI, has introduced the Veterans Fellowship Act, which aims to establish a pilot program providing short-term fellowship opportunities for veterans. This initiative is designed to facilitate veterans' transition into civilian employment by allowing them to gain relevant experience while receiving a monthly stipend.

The bill, introduced on March 5, 2025, addresses the growing need for effective reintegration programs for veterans facing challenges in securing stable employment after their service. The proposed fellowship program will enable veterans to work with various employers for periods up to 20 weeks, enhancing their job readiness and increasing the chances of long-term employment opportunities.

Moolenaar's proposal comes at a time when the unemployment rate among veterans remains higher than the national average, prompting lawmakers to seek innovative solutions to support this demographic. The bill proposes selecting between three and five states to implement the program, collaborating with non-profit organizations to facilitate the fellowships.

Each participating veteran would receive a stipend, helping to ease the financial burden during their transition period. Additionally, this act mandates that the U.S. Comptroller General review and report on the program’s effectiveness within four years, ensuring accountability and providing insights for potential future initiatives.

Funding for the Veterans Fellowship Act includes an authorization of $10 million annually for the fiscal years 2025 through 2029, sourced from existing funds designated for veterans' employment services. With this legislation, Rep. Moolenaar aims to not only improve veterans' employment prospects but also contribute to a more robust support system for those who have served the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA, has introduced a new bill aimed at enhancing entrepreneurial training as part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). The proposed legislation seeks to authorize a comprehensive study that evaluates the effectiveness and outcomes of entrepreneurial skills development programs across various states. 

The bill was introduced to address the growing need for entrepreneurship in job creation and economic stability. As the job market evolves, fostering entrepreneurial skills has become increasingly essential to prepare individuals for dynamic economic conditions. By reviewing successful practices in this area, the bill aims to provide critical insights into how such programs can be improved and expanded.

If enacted, the bill would initiate a three-year multistate study focused on various facets of entrepreneurial training, including the qualifications necessary for training providers, best practices for mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs, and the correlation between these programs and successful business outcomes. Additionally, the study would assess whether participants see an increase in earnings three years post-completion of the programs.

This initiative also intends to assist local and state communities by proposing strategies for expanding access to entrepreneurial training. The bill recognizes that entrepreneurship is vital for driving economic development, particularly in underserved areas where job opportunities may be scarce. 

Previously, the WIOA primarily focused on traditional workforce development, emphasizing job placement and training for existing occupations. However, as the economy demands a shift towards self-employment and innovation, this new legislative effort highlights a promising direction for workforce policy. 

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, has introduced the SPEED for BEAD Act aimed at enhancing the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program established under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The legislation seeks to streamline processes for broadband deployment, making funding more accessible for community anchor institutions and promoting high-speed internet access nationwide.

The introduction of this bill comes as communities across the U.S. still grapple with gaps in reliable broadband access, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's shift toward online work and education. Hudson's initiative aims to tackle these disparities directly by ensuring that federal funds allocated for broadband expansion are utilized effectively and efficiently. The bill proposes to make gigabit-level broadband service—defined as reliable service with speeds of at least 1,000 megabits per second—an eligible standard for funding.

Key provisions of the SPEED for BEAD Act include prohibiting unnecessary requirements that may hinder project development, such as restrictive labor agreements or local hiring quotas. Furthermore, it broadens the eligibility of technologies used in broadband deployment, ensuring that a variety of approaches can qualify for federal support.

Additionally, the bill addresses the misallocation of funds by mandating that any unused federal funding be redirected to the Treasury rather than remain dormant. With this legislation, Hudson emphasizes the importance of not only bridging the digital divide but also fostering an environment that promotes innovation and competition within the broadband sector.

As the bill moves forward in the legislative process, it promises to play a critical role in reshaping how broadband infrastructure is developed, ensuring that all Americans have access to the necessary tools for participation in today's digital economy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-TX, introduced the Criminal Illegal Alien Report Act on February 27, 2025, aiming to enhance transparency surrounding crimes committed by individuals granted parole under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The proposed legislation mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security submit a comprehensive report to Congress detailing these offenses within 60 days of enactment.

The bill responds to ongoing concerns among lawmakers and constituents regarding the safety implications of allowing certain immigrants parole status. By requiring a report, Luttrell aims to shed light on the criminal activities of individuals who have entered the U.S. under programs like the Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. This is particularly pertinent as public opinion remains divided over immigration policies and their effects on community safety.

The act's provisions include information about the nationalities of parole recipients who have committed crimes, their connections to terrorist organizations, and any affiliations with transnational criminal groups. Advocates suggest that this data is essential for informing future legislation and policy decisions regarding immigration and national security.

Luttrell's introduction of this bill comes amidst heightened debates over border security and the need for accountability among immigrants in the U.S. As crime rates and immigration remain hot button issues, lawmakers hope that better reporting mechanisms could facilitate more effective responses to potential threats.

The Criminal Illegal Alien Report Act is currently under review by the House Judiciary Committee, where it will undergo further examination and discussion before any votes may take place. The bill highlights the urgency legislators feel in addressing perceived risks associated with specific immigration pathways.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1695",40434,"Rep. Harrigan Introduces Guarding Readiness Resources Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-NC, has introduced the Guarding Readiness Resources Act, a legislative measure aimed at enhancing the financial framework governing reimbursements received by the National Guard Bureau from state entities. This bill, brought forth in the House on February 27, 2025, seeks to ensure that funds reimbursed for the use of military property can be effectively credited back to the appropriate accounts.

The bill addresses a critical gap in the current financial management of National Guard resources, clarifying that reimbursements from states or territories must contribute to the repair and maintenance of military equipment utilized by National Guard units. By stipulating that these funds be credited to the respective appropriations, the legislation intends to bolster operational readiness among state-level military units, allowing them to better respond to emergencies and disaster relief efforts.

Introduced as a response to evolving demands on the National Guard, the Act recognizes the importance of ensuring that reimbursements are not just financial transactions but crucial investments in maintaining operational effectiveness. Historically, the role of the National Guard has expanded to include disaster response and domestic support missions, necessitating a robust financial structure to support these initiatives.

The potential impact of this legislation is twofold: it streamlines financial processes within the Department of Defense while also reinforcing the National Guard's commitment to operational readiness. As states increasingly rely on National Guard support for various critical functions, ensuring resources are properly utilized and maintained is essential for national security and community safety.

The Guarding Readiness Resources Act has been referred to the House Committee on Armed Services for further discussion and evaluation, marking an important step toward strengthening the financial mechanisms that support the National Guard’s vital missions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Harriet M. Hageman, R-WY, has introduced the GUARD Act, aimed at amending the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The bill seeks to disqualify states from receiving federal funding if they discriminate against parents or guardians who oppose medical and social transitioning practices for minors, particularly when such practices contradict the child’s biological sex.

This legislation responds to increasing concerns among some lawmakers and parents regarding how gender identity issues are being addressed at state levels. It emerges amid ongoing debates about parental rights in healthcare decisions related to minors. Advocates argue that parents should have the authority to oppose medical interventions they believe to be inappropriate, while critics warn that the bill may undermine access to essential care for gender-diverse youth.

If enacted, the GUARD Act would prohibit states from taking any adverse action against guardians who resist measures that affirm a minor’s claimed gender identity. Enforcement provisions would allow parents experiencing discrimination to file lawsuits against states to challenge the withholding of federal funds, thereby emphasizing the bill's punitive measures against non-compliant states.

This legislative effort is indicative of a broader push within conservative circles to reinforce parental rights in medical decisions related to gender identity and expression among minors. Proponents of the bill suggest that it safeguards familial rights, while opponents contend it could harm transgender youth by limiting their access to supportive resources and necessary medical care.

The GUARD Act was referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further scrutiny. Its introduction signifies a pivotal moment in the ongoing national conversation surrounding gender identity and parental rights, framing the discussion within legislative parameters.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-TX, has introduced the Checkpoint Modernization Act aimed at enhancing U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints. The legislation proposes immediate renovation efforts to improve safety for law enforcement personnel, increase the efficiency of detecting illegal activities, and alleviate traffic congestion along the southern border.

The introduction of this bill follows growing concerns over the current state of Border Patrol checkpoints, which are often outdated and in need of repairs. With increased border traffic and persistent challenges in combating human smuggling and contraband, the Act seeks to address these pressing issues by prioritizing renovation projects. According to the bill, the enhancements will not only aim to bolster the operational capacity of border agents but also ensure the safety of both personnel and the public.

Funding for these renovations is a critical aspect of the proposal; it authorizes the appropriation of a minimum of $150 million annually from fiscal years 2025 through 2028. This financial backing is intended to provide the resources necessary for effective implementations of the planned upgrades. The bill mandates that the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection will report annually to Congress on the progress and status of the renovations, ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of taxpayer funds.

The Checkpoint Modernization Act reflects a broader legislative strategy to enhance national security and improve the efficiency of border management. Supporters of the bill argue that modernized checkpoints will lead to more effective border enforcement and a reduction in illegal activities, ultimately contributing to a safer environment for citizens and law enforcement alike. As the U.S. faces evolving challenges at its borders, this initiative may serve as an important step in revitalizing the country’s immigration control mechanisms.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Sherman, D-CA, has introduced the Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act, a legislative measure aimed at reviewing travel restrictions to North Korea and formally ending the Korean War. The bill, introduced on March 4, 2025, is a response to ongoing tensions and seeks to enhance diplomatic engagements between the U.S., North Korea, and South Korea.

The Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act is designed to address issues stemming from the longstanding ceasefire that ended active hostilities in 1953 but did not formally conclude the Korean War. As North Korea continues its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the act underscores the importance of diplomatic solutions, reflecting growing congressional recognition that achieving peace on the Korean peninsula is vital for U.S. national security.

In addition to calling for an end to the war, the bill mandates a comprehensive review by the Secretary of State regarding existing U.S. travel bans to North Korea. Currently, approximately 100,000 Americans have family members living in North Korea, but restrictions hinder their ability to reunite. This recognition of humanitarian concerns is a critical aspect of the proposal, as it aims to offer families the opportunity to maintain ties with their loved ones.

Sherman highlighted the need for a roadmap to foster peace discussions and believes that pursuing a binding peace agreement would mark a significant step toward stabilizing the region. The act calls for establishing liaison offices in both nations as a mechanism to facilitate dialogue and improve relations. The successful passage of this legislation could pave the way for a new chapter in U.S.-North Korean relations, characterized by negotiated peace rather than military tension.

John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Innovation Act, aimed at accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources while promoting technological advancements in clean energy. The bill seeks to provide funding and incentives for research and development in renewable technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across various sectors.

This legislative push comes amid growing concerns about climate change and the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions to meet international climate agreements. The Clean Energy Innovation Act proposes to allocate significant federal funds for startups focused on renewable energy solutions, including solar, wind, and geothermal technologies. By encouraging innovation, the bill aims not only to reduce dependency on fossil fuels but also to foster job creation in the burgeoning clean energy sector.

Analysts suggest that the potential impact of the bill could be substantial. It is estimated that by investing in clean energy initiatives, thousands of new jobs could be created while also decreasing energy costs for consumers in the long run. The act is positioned to stimulate local economies, especially in states reliant on traditional energy sectors, by providing the necessary support for a smoother transition to sustainable practices.

The introduction of the Clean Energy Innovation Act is also a response to public demand for more aggressive action against climate change. Recent surveys indicate that a significant majority of Americans support government interventions aimed at boosting renewable energy. The bill aligns with broader national goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, emphasizing the urgency of legislative action in creating a sustainable future.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. James P. McGovern, D-MA, has introduced the Breaking the Gridlock Act, a comprehensive legislative proposal aimed at addressing key policy priorities and revitalizing congressional productivity. The bill encompasses various strategies including the establishment of a congressional time capsule, provisions for fire suppression funding, and measures to enhance support for veterans and military families.

The Breaking the Gridlock Act was designed in response to growing frustration over legislative inaction and is intended to streamline operations across multiple congressional committees. By facilitating better coordination among these committees, the bill aims to address urgent issues facing the country, including emergency response to wildfires and support for veterans.

Among its significant provisions, the legislation proposes the creation of the Semiquincentennial Congressional Time Capsule, which will include historically relevant materials and messages to future generations. This initiative is expected to help foster a sense of civic responsibility and encourage future congresses to value historical context in legislative efforts.

Additionally, the bill introduces standardized operating procedures for fire suppression cost-sharing agreements, ensuring speedy reimbursements to local fire departments that respond to emergencies. This change comes as wildfires have become increasingly destructive, making responsive and effective fire management crucial for local communities.

McGovern’s legislation also emphasizes the United States’ commitment to addressing international threats, mandating reviews of strategies to counter Boko Haram in Nigeria. This reflects a broader intention to enhance U.S. foreign policy initiatives while ensuring that veterans receive adequate resources and support through updated programs and funding.

With its multifaceted approach, the Breaking the Gridlock Act aims not only to break the legislative deadlock in Congress but also to set a precedent for future collaborative efforts across party lines.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-NY, has introduced the Working Families Tax Cut Act, aiming to amend the Internal Revenue Code by renaming the standard deduction to the guaranteed deduction. The proposed legislation seeks to enhance support for families by introducing a bonus deduction for the taxable years 2026 and 2027.

The Working Families Tax Cut Act is a response to the increasing economic pressures faced by families, with the intention of alleviating financial strain through tax relief. By renaming the standard deduction to a guaranteed deduction, the bill emphasizes a commitment to ensuring that tax benefits are more accessible and reliable for working families. This change not only redefines the terminology but aims to enhance the perception and utility of tax relief.

The bill outlines specific bonuses tied to the new guaranteed deduction, proposing amounts of $4,000 for those filing jointly, $3,000 for heads of household, and $2,000 for other filers. It also includes provisions for inflation adjustments in subsequent years to ensure the bonuses retain their value against rising costs. Furthermore, eligibility for the bonus is capped based on modified adjusted gross income, gradually reducing the bonus for higher earners, thereby targeting support toward lower and middle-income households.

Malliotakis's introduction of this legislation comes as a strategic move, aligning with the ongoing national discourse around support for families amidst economic challenges. It aims to strengthen fiscal security for households, encouraging more substantial consumer spending, which is vital for economic recovery. This bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it will await further consideration and discussion.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-RI, has introduced a new bill aimed at establishing Golden Sea Bream as an acceptable market name for the fish species Stenotomus chrysops. This move seeks to enhance the marketing and sales of this species, which is often referred to by its less marketable name, the scup.

The introduction of this bill is rooted in a desire to support local fishermen and the seafood industry in Rhode Island by providing a more appealing name for a fish that has gained popularity among consumers for its taste and versatility. By officially designating Golden Sea Bream as a legitimate market name, the bill aims to elevate the product's status and facilitate greater sales opportunities both locally and in national markets.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant for the fishing industry in Magaziner's district, as it opens doors to broader market accessibility. Seafood marketing experts believe that a name like Golden Sea Bream could resonate well with consumers, especially in upscale markets and restaurants, thus ensuring better price points for fishermen. This aligns with ongoing efforts to promote sustainable seafood practices and local fisheries.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. Should it pass, it may set a precedent for renaming other fish species to improve their marketability and support local economies. As the fishing industry continues to face challenges due to competition and changing consumer preferences, such legislative measures are crucial for sustaining and enhancing the viability of domestic seafood markets.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Investment Act, aimed at accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources across the United States. The bill seeks to allocate significant federal funding to clean energy projects, promote energy efficiency, and provide tax incentives for both individuals and businesses that invest in sustainable technologies.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst growing concerns about climate change and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As various studies show the increasing impact of climate change on weather patterns, public health, and the economy, the federal government recognizes the necessity of investing in clean energy solutions. The Clean Energy Investment Act is positioned as a critical step toward achieving these goals, fostering innovation, and improving energy resilience.

If passed, the bill is expected to create thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector, stimulating economic growth while addressing the rising demand for clean energy. By promoting policies that encourage solar, wind, and other renewable sources, it aims to reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, combat air pollution, and enhance energy independence. 

In addition to capital investment, the Clean Energy Investment Act proposes streamlined regulations for energy projects, making it easier for states and local governments to adopt and implement renewable energy initiatives. It also emphasizes public awareness campaigns designed to educate citizens about the benefits of energy-efficient practices.

"$H billintroh-250304-hr1822",40434,"Rep. Feenstra Introduces ACRE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-IA, has introduced the Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act of 2025, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to exclude interest received on select loans secured by rural or agricultural real property from gross income. The bill seeks to ease financial burdens for rural areas and promote sustainable agricultural practices.

This legislation responds to ongoing challenges faced by farmers and rural property owners, exacerbated by fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty. By offering tax relief on interest income from qualified real estate loans, the ACRE Act intends to incentivize lending for agricultural properties, thereby enhancing access to credit in these vital sectors.

The proposed act defines qualified real estate loans broadly, encompassing loans secured by agricultural land, forestland, and other related properties. Additionally, it stipulates that the beneficiaries of such loans must not include foreign adversaries, ensuring that American resources support American interests. This targeted exclusion aims to bolster domestic agriculture while safeguarding national economic interests.

The potential impact of this bill extends beyond mere tax relief; it could facilitate a revitalization of the agricultural sector, fostering growth and innovation. By removing the tax burden on interest income, lenders may be more inclined to extend favorable terms to farmers and ranchers, thereby lowering costs for borrowers and encouraging investment in rural infrastructure.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, stakeholders in the agricultural community are closely monitoring its progress. A report monitoring the implications of the act on lending rates and overall economic growth is mandated within five years of its enactment, promising a structured approach to evaluating its effectiveness in supporting rural economies.

"$H billintroh-250304-hr1821",40434,"Rep. Calvert Introduces HELD Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ken Calvert, R-CA, has introduced the Help Ensure Legal Detainers Act, or HELD Act, aiming to restrict federal funding to states that obstruct local law enforcement’s ability to maintain custody of undocumented immigrants under immigration detainers. This bill was introduced on March 4, 2025, and has been referred to the Judiciary Committee for further consideration.

The HELD Act emerges amid increasing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and state compliance. Proponents argue that the legislation is necessary to ensure that immigration laws are effectively implemented at local levels, as several states have adopted policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. These policies, deemed as sanctuary laws, have spurred concerns regarding public safety and the enforcement of immigration statutes. By withholding federal funds, the bill seeks to incentivize state compliance with immigration detainers issued by the Department of Homeland Security.

Should the HELD Act become law, it could significantly impact local governments that have enacted such protections for undocumented immigrants. Experts suggest that this legislation may increase strain on community resources, as states may seek to allocate additional funding to cover the loss of federal support. On the flip side, supporters of the bill argue that it promotes accountability and encourages states to assist federal agencies in managing immigration matters effectively.

As the legislative process unfolds, the HELD Act is likely to spark extensive debate in Congress regarding the balance between state rights and federal immigration enforcement. The bill highlights the ongoing national conversation about immigration policy and local sovereignty, reflecting deep divisions within the political landscape on how best to address these complex issues.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Melanie A. Stansbury, D-NM, has introduced the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act, aiming to establish an Office of Inspector General for the judicial branch to enhance accountability and oversight within the federal judiciary. This bill addresses growing concerns regarding judicial conduct and aims to restore public trust in the judicial system by ensuring ethical standards are upheld.

The bill comes in response to increasing scrutiny over judicial ethics, particularly concerning allegations of misconduct that have garnered widespread media attention. By creating an independent office to investigate potential violations, including those involving Supreme Court justices, the act seeks to mitigate perceptions of bias and ensure justice is served fairly and equitably. The new office would have the authority to conduct audits and investigations, thereby providing a critical check on judicial power.

If enacted, the legislation would empower the Inspector General to handle a variety of cases involving alleged misconduct, allowing for comprehensive reviews of judicial actions without infringing on the merits of judicial decisions. The proposed Inspector General would be appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States and report activities and findings annually to Congress, thereby promoting transparency in judicial operations.

This legislative initiative aligns with broader national conversations regarding ethics and integrity in government institutions. The potential impact of such a measure could be significant, fostering a culture of accountability within the judiciary while addressing constituents' calls for more robust oversight mechanisms.

The bill, introduced on March 3, 2025, is currently under review by the House Committee on the Judiciary, where it will undergo further scrutiny. Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, R-MP, has introduced the Employment Services and Jobs Parity Act, a significant legislative effort aimed at expanding the reach of the Wagner-Peyser Act to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa. This bill seeks to ensure that these territories receive equitable access to critical employment services and resources.

The impetus for the bill arises from a growing recognition of the unique challenges faced by these territories, particularly in the realms of unemployment and job placement services. By amending the Wagner-Peyser Act, the measure aims to provide enhanced support for job seekers in these regions, thereby promoting economic growth and workforce development. Currently, territories like Guam benefit from the provisions of the Act, while the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa do not enjoy the same level of support.

If passed, this legislation would allow for a more equitable distribution of federal resources for employment services across U.S. territories. This is especially crucial given the increasing economic pressures that these regions face, which have been exacerbated by global economic challenges and recent public health crises. By integrating these territories into existing federal employment frameworks, the bill aims to bolster the local job markets and support sustainable employment opportunities.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where it will undergo further examination and discussion. Advocates for the bill underscore its potential impact on reducing unemployment and fostering a more inclusive job market for underrepresented regions in the U.S. As it moves forward, stakeholders will closely watch its progress in Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John James, R-MI, has introduced a new bill aimed at enhancing research and treatment for sickle cell disease and other hereditary blood disorders. The Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2025 seeks to renew federal funding and boost efforts to prevent and treat these conditions, which disproportionately affect African American communities and other minority groups.

The legislation expands the existing Public Health Service Act by reauthorizing a demonstration program specifically targeting sickle cell disease. One of the key focuses of this bill is to increase funding from $4.45 million to $8.2 million annually for the years 2025 through 2029. Enhanced resources are expected to improve patient care and foster innovative research to address the underlying complexities of heritable blood disorders.

The introduction of this bill comes at a crucial time, as the impact of sickle cell disease continues to strain healthcare systems and families across America. Despite advances in treatment, individuals affected by this condition often face significant health challenges and complications, highlighting the need for ongoing investment in research. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the causes of sickle cell disease, making further research imperative to develop effective cures and treatment options.

This legislation aims not only to improve the health outcomes of those affected by sickle cell disease but also to promote awareness and education regarding hereditary blood disorders. If passed, it could mark a significant step toward equitable healthcare access and enhanced research funding essential for tackling this long-standing public health issue.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-CT, has introduced the American Apprenticeship Act, a bill aimed at enhancing workforce development through federal support for apprenticeship programs. This legislation seeks to provide financial assistance to states for pre-apprenticeship initiatives and related instruction that helps individuals enter and succeed in qualified apprenticeship programs.

The American Apprenticeship Act comes in response to the growing demand for skilled labor in various industries, including healthcare, advanced manufacturing, and information technology. With many sectors facing labor shortages, the bill aims to build a robust pipeline of talent that equips workers with the necessary skills to meet these challenges. By funding pre-apprenticeship programs, the legislation endeavors to lower barriers to entry for underrepresented groups, including minorities and veterans, thus promoting diversity in trades.

The bill mandates the establishment of a competitive grant process administered by the Secretary of Labor, aimed at supporting state initiatives that collaborate with industry partners and educational institutions. States would be required to submit strategic plans detailing how they intend to launch or expand apprenticeship programs, ensuring alignment with the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

Funding authorized by the American Apprenticeship Act amounts to $15 million annually from 2026 to 2031, underscoring the commitment to investing in workforce development. The legislation's holistic approach addresses not only the financial aspects but also emphasizes the importance of partnerships and training that meets industry standards.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kathy Castor, D-FL, has introduced a bill aimed at repealing several recent executive orders issued on January 20, 2025. The proposed legislation, if enacted, would nullify directives that Castor and supporters argue could harm both the environment and renewable energy initiatives in the United States.

The bill outlines the repeal of four specific executive orders titled Unleashing American Energy, Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements, Declaring a National Energy Emergency, and a mandate concerning offshore wind leasing practices. By targeting these orders, Castor seeks to shift the focus back to a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy policy that aligns with her constituents' interests and broader climate goals.

The introduction of this bill coincides with growing concerns among environmental advocates about the repercussions of prioritizing fossil fuel development over renewable energy resources. Advocates argue that such policies undermine international climate commitments and hinder progress towards a cleaner energy future.

This legislation has the potential to significantly impact federal energy policy by reinstating more stringent environmental protections and promoting the expansion of renewable energy projects, especially in regions like Florida that are particularly vulnerable to climate change.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-TX, has introduced the Second Chances for Rural Hospitals Act, aiming to amend the Social Security Act to broaden the criteria for rural emergency hospital designation. This legislation seeks to address the challenges faced by rural healthcare facilities, particularly those that have halted operations but previously served critical roles in their communities.

The bill was prompted by the ongoing struggle of rural hospitals to stay afloat amid financial pressures exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors. Many rural areas have seen essential healthcare services decline, which has heightened the urgency for legislative action that could revive these vital institutions. The proposed changes will allow hospitals that were previously classified as critical access hospitals or subsection (d) hospitals to regain their status, provided they fit specific criteria detailing their operations prior to their closure.

By redefining qualification parameters, the Second Chances for Rural Hospitals Act is anticipated to positively impact healthcare access for millions living in rural populations. Enhanced access to emergency services is crucial for these communities, where the nearest hospital may be several miles away. The proposed bill aims to create a more responsive healthcare infrastructure that can better cater to the unique needs of rural residents.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it has garnered attention from various stakeholders, including healthcare advocates and local governments. Their support underscores the necessity for sustainable healthcare solutions in rural regions, highlighting the potential for this bill to make a significant difference in the lives of many who depend on these services.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Troy Balderson, R-OH, has introduced the Awning Safety Act of 2025, aiming to enhance consumer safety standards for retractable awnings. This legislation will necessitate the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to develop mandatory guidelines to mitigate risks associated with these products, ensuring they are less likely to cause injury or death.

Concerns regarding retractable awnings have surged, particularly about incidents where these devices unexpectedly open, posing dangers to users and bystanders. The proposed bill responds to calls from safety advocates and consumers who have reported accidents related to the operation of these awnings. By mandating a safety standard within 18 months of the bill's enactment, the legislation seeks to address these hazardous situations proactively.

The Awning Safety Act would specifically require the CPSC to scrutinize various types of retractable awning devices, determining which fall under the new regulations. It aims to create a comprehensive framework that would not only specify safety measures but also enhance consumer awareness regarding proper usage and installation.

This legislation could have a significant impact on the awning industry, particularly for manufacturers who would need to comply with new safety requirements. Moreover, it is anticipated to foster greater consumer confidence in retractable awnings, encouraging safer purchasing practices. Crucially, the act has potential implications for future product safety regulations, highlighting a growing trend towards increased scrutiny of consumer products.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Valadao, R-CA, has introduced the Eliminating the Marriage Penalty in SSI Act, aimed at reforming Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities. This bill seeks to ensure that the marriage of these individuals will not negatively impact their SSI benefits.

The impetus for the bill stems from concerns that the current SSI structure penalizes marriage for those affected by disabilities. Under existing regulations, marriage often leads to reduced benefits due to combined incomes, discouraging individuals from pursuing personal relationships. By eliminating this penalty, the legislation hopes to foster greater independence and social integration for disabled individuals, allowing them to maintain adequate financial support without the fear of losing essential income when marrying.

The potential impact of the EMPSA Act is significant, as it targets a long-standing issue within the SSI program. Currently, many adults with disabilities face economic stresses that can hinder their ability to live autonomously. Supporters argue that this reform will provide a more equitable system that acknowledges and supports the needs of couples facing disabilities. It aims to remove financial barriers that could otherwise prevent them from establishing stable familial or marital relationships.

Valadao's introduction of the bill was complemented by the support of Rep. Susie Lee, D-NV, underlining a rare bipartisan effort to improve social welfare for individuals affected by disabilities. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, where discussions about its provisions and impacts will take place. As the legislative process unfolds, advocates for disability rights are hopeful it will gain necessary momentum to become law and positively affect the lives of countless individuals.

Marilyn Strickland, D-WA, has introduced the HEARD Act of 2025, a significant piece of legislation aimed at enhancing investment in research related to rare diseases among minority populations. This act seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act to facilitate robust research efforts and promote health equity in addressing these often-overlooked medical conditions.

The introduction of the HEARD Act is a response to ongoing disparities in healthcare outcomes for minority populations, particularly regarding rare diseases. Strickland emphasizes that these communities face unique challenges due to a lack of targeted research and resources. The bill aims to ensure that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocates resources effectively to expand research into these conditions, thereby improving the public health landscape.

One of the key provisions of the HEARD Act includes establishing a Coordinating Committee to oversee the NIH’s efforts in rare diseases health equity. This committee will involve various stakeholders, including federal health agencies and community representatives, to ensure comprehensive oversight and collaboration. The initiative highlights the importance of community engagement and public health education to raise awareness and improve understanding of these diseases.

Moreover, the bill lays out a framework for enhancing educational programs targeted at healthcare professionals. By doing so, it anticipates improving the quality of care for patients suffering from rare diseases in minority groups. The act also envisions creating mentorship and scholarship opportunities for new healthcare professionals entering this critical field.

Overall, the HEARD Act represents a pivotal moment in advancing health equity, aiming not only to bolster research but also to foster a healthcare environment that is more inclusive and responsive to the needs of minority populations affected by rare diseases.

The bill (H.R. 1750) introduced on 02/27/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Johnson, Henry C. ""Hank"" [D-GA-4]...03/26/2025; Del. Norton, Eleanor Holmes [D-DC-At Large]...03/26/2025; Rep. Thanedar, Shri [D-MI-13]...03/26/2025.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1749",40434,"Rep. Steube Introduces Safe Storage Lockers for House Office Buildings Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. W. Gregory Steube, R-FL, has introduced the Safe Storage Lockers for House Office Buildings Act, aimed at allowing House employees authorized to possess certain weapons to store them securely while working in House office buildings. The bill seeks to address growing concerns over safety amid rising crime rates in Washington, D.C.

The proposed legislation comes in response to the escalating violent crime incidents in the District, which totaled 3,469 in 2024. Many employees commute through areas that have made them potential targets for crime. While self-defense laws in D.C. allow specific weapons such as stun guns and pepper sprays, current federal law prevents their carry within federal building premises, leaving House employees with limited means of protection at work.

Under the framework of the bill, employees who are legally authorized to carry their weapons may store them in designated lockers managed by the U.S. Capitol Police when they enter the buildings. This would ensure that employees feel safer while conducting their duties in an environment that can sometimes feel insecure.

The bill outlines a clear process for compliance, requiring House employees to enter the buildings through designated entrances and to leave the premises immediately after storing their weapons. By providing this secure storage option, the legislation aims to balance the need for self-defense while respecting security protocols within federal buildings.

As the bill moves through Congress, it highlights a growing recognition of the need to adapt safety measures for personnel in the often challenging environment of the nation’s capital. If passed, it could pave the way for updated protective strategies that consider both the rights and safety of lawmakers and their staff.

The bill (H.R. 1749) was introduced on 02/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1743",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces UNITED Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adrian Smith, R-NE, has introduced the UNITED Act, which aims to grant the President authority to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement with the United Kingdom. This initiative seeks to enhance economic cooperation, streamline trade, and bolster supply chain resilience between the two nations.

The introduction of this legislation comes at a critical time as the United States aims to strengthen its international partnerships in response to evolving global trade dynamics. Supporters believe that a renewed trade agreement with the UK could lead to significant economic benefits for American workers, farmers, and businesses by reducing trade barriers and opening new markets.

The legislative intent behind the UNITED Act emphasizes the importance of fostering a robust economic relationship with the UK, drawing on the historical “special relationship” that both countries have shared. The bill highlights the need to establish a high-standard agreement that not only facilitates trade but also incorporates labor and environmental protections, further mitigating concerns over regulatory arbitrage.

This initiative is timely, as the UK is actively pursuing expanded market access globally. The UNITED Act aims to empower the President with the necessary authority to engage swiftly in negotiations, ensuring that American interests are represented and that the U.S. remains competitive in international commerce. If the agreement is enacted, it would require Congress’s approval for any modifications or extensions beyond its initial duration, thereby maintaining legislative oversight.

The proposed legislation reflects a broad bipartisan acknowledgment of the strategic benefits that a revived trade relationship with the UK could bring, paving the way for a dynamic economic partnership that aligns with modern trade principles. The bill has been referred to the House Ways and Means and Rules Committees for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1739",40434,"Rep. Roy Introduces Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act, aimed at amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to enhance fiscal accountability, bolster school accountability for student loans, and improve transparency within higher education institutions.

The legislation responds to increasing concerns over student debt and the overall efficacy of educational outcomes in higher education. By establishing stricter accountability measures, the bill seeks to hold educational institutions accountable for loan default rates and enhance the dissemination of critical information regarding student success rates and financial aid usage. This approach is poised to empower prospective students to make more informed choices while navigating their education and financing options.

One key provision requires institutions to publish detailed metrics including enrollment statuses, graduation rates, and employment outcomes for graduates. Proponents argue that such transparency will incentivize institutions to improve educational quality and outcomes, thereby fostering a more competitive educational environment.

The act introduces a new category of loans known as Federal Direct simplification loans, which would operate under revised interest rates and streamlined repayment schedules. This is intended to simplify the borrowing process and reduce the financial burden on students. Additionally, the bill proposes phasing out certain loan forgiveness programs, emphasizing personal accountability and balance repayment, which aligns with a broader trend of reforming federal student loan policies.

By facilitating alternative methods of accreditation through state-led frameworks, the bill also aims to expand educational opportunities and enhance access to various educational programs, including apprenticeships. This approach reflects a movement toward diversifying pathways to higher education credentials.

With the introduction of this legislation, Rep. Roy seeks to address persistent challenges in the higher educational landscape while promoting opportunity and accountability. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 1739) was introduced on 02/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1733",40434,"Rep. Perez Introduces Rural Veterans Transportation to Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-WA, has introduced the Rural Veterans Transportation to Care Act, a bill designed to enhance transportation accessibility for veterans residing in remote areas. The legislation seeks to modify the existing grant program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide innovative transportation solutions specifically tailored for veterans in highly rural regions.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to persistent challenges faced by veterans in accessing healthcare services. Many veterans live in rural areas far from medical facilities, making travel a significant barrier to receiving timely care. The Transportation to Care Act aims not only to streamline transportation services but also to widen eligibility for funding to include county veterans service organizations and tribal organizations, thereby fostering greater inclusivity.

Should the bill be enacted, it is projected to impact thousands of veterans, improving their access to vital medical appointments and services. The proposed changes include increasing the maximum grant amount from $60,000 to $80,000 for recipients required to purchase vehicles compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This adjustment recognizes the complex needs of veterans who may require specialized transportation to facilitate their care.

The legislation builds upon previous efforts to support veterans, particularly those living in underserved areas. By expanding the scope and funding of transportation services, the Rural Veterans Transportation to Care Act highlights the commitment to ensuring that no veteran is left behind due to geographical limitations. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and awaits further consideration as Congress documents ongoing efforts to improve veterans’ health services.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1732",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces Clean Energy Expansion Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jane Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Expansion Act, aimed at significantly increasing investments in renewable energy sources and promoting sustainability efforts across the nation. This legislation seeks to enhance the transition from fossil fuels to green energy, thereby addressing climate change and boosting the American economy.

The Clean Energy Expansion Act was introduced in response to the increasing urgency of climate-related challenges, as scientists warn of the detrimental impacts of climate change on the environment and public health. By facilitating the adoption of solar, wind, and other renewable energy technologies, the bill aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy independence. It comes at a time when many states are facing escalating costs from traditional energy sources and a growing demand for cleaner alternatives.

If passed, the Act is expected to create thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector, providing a substantial boost to local economies. The bill includes provisions for financial incentives for businesses and homeowners to install renewable energy systems, as well as funding for research and development of innovative energy technologies. This comprehensive approach not only aims to increase energy efficiency but also seeks to ensure that marginalized communities have access to green technology and resources.

Furthermore, the Clean Energy Expansion Act seeks to position the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change.

"$H billintroh-250115-hr435",40434,"Rep. Issa Introduces Direct Hire To Fight Fires","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, has introduced a new bill aimed at addressing the urgent need for wildland firefighters in the United States. The Direct Hire To Fight Fires bill seeks to expedite the hiring process for federal wildland firefighters and related support roles within the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. 

The bill was prompted by the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires across the country, which have stressed existing resources and personnel. Current hiring practices can delay the onboarding of qualified candidates, leaving critical gaps in firefighting capabilities during peak wildfire seasons. By implementing direct hire authority, this legislation would allow for faster appointments of qualified individuals, streamlining the hiring process and reducing bureaucratic obstacles. 

The bill proposes a systematic approach to enhance recruitment and retention of wildland firefighters. It mandates the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to develop policies that minimize hiring delays and address procedural redundancies in federal hiring for wildfire-related positions. Additionally, annual reports on hiring needs and progress towards meeting those needs will enhance transparency and accountability within the agencies.

Contextually, this initiative reflects a broader recognition of the escalating wildfire crisis, exacerbated by climate change and increasing land management challenges. By facilitating quicker access to critical firefighting personnel, the bill aims to strengthen national preparedness and response capabilities. 

As wildfires continue to threaten communities and ecosystems alike, the passage of the Direct Hire To Fight Fires bill could mark a significant step toward more robust wildfire management and disaster response strategies, ensuring that qualified personnel are available when disaster strikes.

The bill (H.R. 435) introduced on 01/15/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Kiley, Kevin [R-CA-3]...01/15/2025; Rep. Obernolte, Jay [R-CA-23]...01/15/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-NY, has introduced the No Russian Tunnel to Crimea Act, aimed at imposing sanctions on any foreign person involved in the construction or maintenance of tunnels or bridges connecting the Russian mainland to the illegally occupied Crimean peninsula. This bill, introduced on January 16, 2025, seeks to deter any actions that would reinforce Russia's hold on Crimea, which has been internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory since its annexation in 2014.

The bill comes amid rising concerns over Russia's military aggression in Ukraine, particularly its use of Crimea as a strategic base for operations. The construction of a tunnel to Crimea has been reported as a potential collaboration between Russian and Chinese officials, raising alarm among U.S. lawmakers. By targeting individuals or companies involved in these projects, the legislation aims to apply economic pressure on Russia and its allies, signaling that the U.S. remains committed to upholding Ukraine's territorial integrity.

The sanctions outlined in the bill would include asset blocking and visa restrictions for anyone knowingly participating in these construction efforts. This approach reflects a broader strategy by the Biden administration to counteract Russian aggression through economic and diplomatic means. Meeks supports a robust response, insisting that such infrastructure projects only serve to bolster the Russian military's capabilities in the region.

As tensions escalate, this legislation not only addresses immediate threats but also sets an important precedent for U.S. foreign policy, emphasizing that cooperation with hostile nations will not be tolerated. It has been sent to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Judiciary for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced a new bill aimed at prohibiting the use of federal funds for properties owned by former President Donald J. Trump. Dubbed the Constitutional Emoluments Protection of American Interests Act of 2025, this legislation seeks to address concerns surrounding conflicts of interest related to Trump's business holdings.

The bill was motivated by ongoing debates about the potential for foreign influence over U.S. politics and the appropriateness of public funds flowing into the private businesses of individuals in power. Proponents argue that allowing taxpayer money to support Trump's entities undermines the integrity of American democracy, particularly given the previous findings of emoluments-related issues during his presidency.

Key provisions of the bill explicitly ban federal funds from being allocated to any property or entity under Trump's control. This includes a comprehensive list of establishments like Trump International Hotels and various golf clubs. The intention is to safeguard American interests by ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not inadvertently enhance Trump's financial portfolio or facilitate foreign relations that may conflict with U.S. policy.

The legislation follows similar efforts in past sessions of Congress and reflects a growing movement among some lawmakers to hold former presidents accountable regarding their financial dealings post-White House. Analysts predict that, if passed, the bill could set a significant precedent for how public funds are managed and monitored in relation to former officeholders.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration, where it will face scrutiny and debate before potentially moving forward in the legislative process.

"$H billintroh-250121-hr571",40434,"Rep. Griffith Introduces Child Insurance Benefits Means-Testing Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-VA, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at reforming child insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. The proposed bill seeks to implement means testing for certain child insurance benefits to better allocate government resources.

The legislation, known as the Child Insurance Benefits Means-Testing Act, comes in response to ongoing concerns regarding the equity and sustainability of social welfare programs. As concerns grow over the increasing federal debt and budget deficits, lawmakers in both parties are searching for ways to ensure that government assistance targets those most in need. By means-testing these benefits, the bill aims to limit eligibility primarily to families with lower incomes, while reducing payouts to higher-earning families.

If passed, the legislation would amend Section 202(d)(7) of the Social Security Act, specifying that children aged 18 years or older who are considered full-time students will no longer be eligible for certain benefits if they have a parent earning over $125,000. This change is expected to streamline the benefits system, making it less of a financial burden on taxpayers while still providing crucial support for those in more dire circumstances.

The conversation around means-testing child insurance benefits reflects broader trends in fiscal policy discussions, where efficiency and targeted support are paramount. Supporters of the bill argue it helps safeguard essential resources for families who genuinely require assistance, while critics express concerns about potential disruptions to the safety net for low-income families.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, stakeholders will be closely monitoring its implications for families and the overall social safety net system in the U.S.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-NJ, has introduced the ____ Act of 2024, aimed at clarifying limitations surrounding full-time National Guard duty performed within States, Territories, or the District of Columbia. This legislation is seen as a necessary step towards ensuring that proper protocols are followed regarding the mobilization of National Guard members.

The backdrop for this bill includes ongoing discussions about the National Guard's role in civil affairs and its deployment in domestic operations. Recently, concerns have arisen regarding the implications of deploying National Guard units without the express consent of state governors or local leaders. The proposed act seeks to amend Title 32 of the United States Code to ensure clearer regulations around this issue.

Specifically, the bill stipulates that National Guard actions at the request of federal authorities—such as the President or the Secretary of Defense—must receive consent from both the governor of the state involved and, if applicable, the Mayor of the District of Columbia. This requirement not only emphasizes local authority in national security matters but also reinforces the principles outlined in the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of federal military personnel in civilian law enforcement scenarios.

The potential impact of the ____ Act of 2024 is significant as it underscores the ongoing dialogue about state versus federal control in military matters; it aims to foster a cooperative framework that respects both levels of governance. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will likely face scrutiny and debate regarding its implications for the National Guard's operational effectiveness and the balance of power between state and federal entities. Rep. Sherrill's initiative signals a commitment to strengthening oversight in matters pertaining to National Guard deployments.

"$H billintroh-250121-hr593",40434,"Rep. Tokuda Introduces Strengthening Pathways to Health Professions Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jill Tokuda, D-HI, has introduced the Strengthening Pathways to Health Professions Act aimed at enhancing the career pathways for healthcare professionals in underserved areas. This bill proposes significant tax reforms that would exclude specific health professions education scholarship and loan repayment payments from gross income, thereby incentivizing education and service in critical fields.

The initiative comes in response to ongoing challenges in the healthcare sector, particularly the shortage of professionals in rural and underserved communities. By easing the financial burden of student loans through tax exemptions, the bill aims to attract more individuals to pursue careers in health professions, especially in high-need areas. This legislative effort is also crucial given escalating concerns about healthcare accessibility amid a rising patient population and existing workforce limitations.

If enacted, the legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code, ensuring that income received from various public health service loan repayment programs, as well as state programs designed to boost healthcare availability in scarcity zones, would not be counted as taxable income. Such a financial incentive is expected to encourage healthcare graduates to serve where they are needed most, thus addressing critical gaps in healthcare provision.

Tokuda is backed by several co-sponsors, including representatives from West Virginia and California, indicating a bipartisan acknowledgment of the importance of this matter.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Terri Sewell, D-AL, has introduced the Rosa Parks Day Act, which proposes to establish Rosa Parks Day as a federal holiday. This initiative seeks to honor the enduring legacy of Rosa Parks, an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, by recognizing her contributions to social justice and human rights in the United States.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about the importance of acknowledging historical figures who have played pivotal roles in advancing civil rights. By designating a federal holiday in her name, advocates believe it will inspire future generations to understand and appreciate the struggles for equality. The establishment of Rosa Parks Day would serve as an opportunity for educational initiatives nationwide, promoting awareness of Parks' commitment to justice and the ongoing fight against racial inequalities.

Should the bill pass, it would mark a significant cultural moment in American history, adding to the list of federal holidays that already celebrate pivotal events and figures in the nation’s past. The recognition could enhance community engagement through events and programs highlighting Parks' life and the broader context of the Civil Rights Movement.

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It has garnered support from a diverse group of co-sponsors, including several prominent Democratic legislators. This support reflects the increasing recognition of the need to celebrate and commemorate the contributions of civil rights leaders in American history. The proposal emphasizes a commitment to ensuring that the legacy of Rosa Parks remains integral to national conversations about freedom, equality, and justice.

"$H billintroh-250205-hr1006",40434,"Rep. Joyce Introduces Higher Education Accountability Tax Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Joyce, R-OH, has introduced the Higher Education Accountability Tax Act, which aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to increase the excise tax on investment income for private colleges and universities. The bill, introduced on February 5, 2025, proposes a rise in the current tax rate from 1.4% to 10%, with additional penalties for institutions that raise tuition fees above inflation rates.

This legislation comes in response to growing concerns about rising higher education costs and the financial sustainability of educational institutions. The intent is to encourage colleges to maintain affordable tuition rates while generating additional tax revenue that can be redirected to student aid programs. By increasing the tax burden on wealthier institutions that fail to control costs, the bill seeks to promote a more equitable educational landscape.

The act also defines “net-price-increase institutions,” which are those whose net prices exceed the rate of inflation over a three-year period, imposing a steeper 20% tax on these entities. Furthermore, it reduces the threshold for colleges subject to this excise tax from $500,000 to $250,000 in investment income, expanding the net of institutions accountable under this law.

The potential impact of the Higher Education Accountability Tax Act is significant, as it could lead to increased scrutiny of private college tuition costs and push for more transparent pricing models. Critics of rising tuition point to the financial strain on families and students, which has prompted this legislative action. This bill aims to address those concerns while adapting the tax framework to reflect the realities of modern higher education. As the legislation progresses through the House Committee on Ways and Means, education advocates will be watching closely for its implications on student affordability and institutional accountability.

The bill (H.R. 1006) introduced on 02/05/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. Malliotakis, Nicole [R-NY-11]...02/05/2025.

"$H billintroh-250305-hr1868",40434,"Rep. Hill Introduces Stop Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. J. French Hill, R-AR, recently introduced the Stop Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, aimed at reforming tax obligations for U.S. nationals unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad. The legislation seeks to postpone tax payment deadlines and reimburse any late fees incurred during their captivity.

The bill's introduction comes in response to growing concerns about the financial burdens faced by American hostages. These individuals may struggle to meet tax obligations while being detained, leading to penalties that could exacerbate their already challenging situations. The legislation aims to alleviate this financial strain by ensuring that the period of unlawful confinement is disregarded when assessing tax liabilities.

If enacted, the bill will amend the Internal Revenue Code to define those eligible for relief and establish a process for tax treatment during their time as hostages. The legislation includes provisions for identifying and compensating individuals for penalties and interest accrued due to their detention, intending to provide both immediate and ongoing relief.

Background on hostage situations highlights the need for legislative support for affected Americans. The integration of this act into the existing tax framework could significantly impact detainees and their families, offering them peace of mind during an already traumatic experience. The bill emphasizes the importance of supporting citizens facing extraordinary circumstances while abroad.

This legislation arrives at a pivotal time as the U.S. government continues to address the complexities surrounding national security and American citizens' safety overseas. With bipartisan support noted among several co-sponsors of the bill, it reflects a collective acknowledgment of the rights and protections needed for Americans who endure the hardships of wrongful detention.

The bill (H.R. 1868) introduced on 03/05/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Titus, Dina [D-NV-1]...03/05/2025; Rep. Tenney, Claudia [R-NY-24]...03/05/2025; Rep. Beyer, Donald S. [D-VA-8]...03/05/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-WA, has introduced the Flight 293 Remembrance Act, aimed at creating a comprehensive database of Armed Forces members who have died in non-combat military plane crashes. The bill seeks to enhance support for families affected by these tragedies, addressing a critical gap in recognition and assistance.

This legislation was prompted by the need to honor the sacrifices of service members who lost their lives during training missions or operational losses, separate from combat-related incidents. Strickland highlighted that these individuals, often facing dangerous circumstances while serving their country, deserve recognition and support. 

If passed, the Flight 293 Remembrance Act will require the Department of Defense to develop a publicly accessible database listing the names, ranks, and service details of those who have perished in such crashes. Additionally, the Act mandates a thorough identification process of these incidents from 1984 onwards, aiming to facilitate detailed record-keeping and remembrance.

The Act is poised to have a significant impact on families of the deceased service members by providing necessary resources and support. It would ensure that families are informed of and have access to benefits, including financial assistance, counseling services, and survivor support specifically tailored to non-combat losses. By establishing a designated point of contact within the Department of Defense, the Act aims to streamline assistance and communications for these families.

As military flight losses continue to be a poignant issue, the Flight 293 Remembrance Act represents a step towards honoring the legacy of the fallen while providing substantial resources to their families in their time of need. Following its introduction, the bill has been referred to the Committees on Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Transition Act aimed at accelerating the United States' shift toward renewable energy sources. The bill proposes significant investment in solar and wind energy infrastructure, along with incentives for businesses and consumers to adopt green technologies.

The Clean Energy Transition Act was introduced in response to growing concerns about climate change and the need for sustainable energy practices. With the scientific consensus highlighting the urgency of reducing carbon emissions, Smith's bill seeks to address both environmental and economic challenges by creating jobs in the clean energy sector while promoting sustainable practices nationwide.

If passed, the legislation is expected to spur considerable advancements in renewable energy technologies. The bill includes provisions for funding research and development of innovative energy solutions, as well as tax breaks for companies that invest in green energy initiatives. This could potentially lead to a reduction in energy costs for consumers, as competition increases within the renewable energy market.

Historically, the U.S. has relied heavily on fossil fuels, which significantly contribute to global warming and air pollution. The transition to clean energy not only aligns with international climate agreements but also supports a growing movement among states and cities adopting aggressive clean energy goals. By facilitating a shift to renewable resources, the Clean Energy Transition Act is positioned to play a pivotal role in reshaping the nation's energy landscape.

Moreover, the legislation is expected to create numerous job opportunities in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems, targeting communities affected by the decline of fossil fuel industries. As the nation grapples with climate-related challenges, Representative Smith's bill presents a proactive approach to building a sustainable future while boosting the economy.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-OR, introduced the Gambling Addiction Recovery, Investment, and Treatment Act aimed at addressing the growing issue of gambling addiction in the United States. This legislation proposes to establish a grant program that allocates federal funds to states for initiatives focused on preventing and treating gambling addiction.

The bill acknowledges the alarming rise in gambling-related harm, exacerbated by the increasing legalization of sports betting and online gambling across various states. Rep. Salinas noted the need for a coordinated response to provide essential support and treatment for those affected by gambling addiction. By providing states with federal assistance, the measure aims to enhance local programs and initiatives designed to combat the detrimental effects of gambling.

Under the proposed act, the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use would oversee the allocation of grants to states. These grants will be distributed in proportions similar to existing federal funding for substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) would be authorized to facilitate research efforts aimed at better understanding gambling addiction.

The act mandates a report three years post-enactment to assess the effectiveness of these programs. Financially, it sets forth an authorization for appropriations over the next decade, with funding sourced from taxes generated by gambling activities, ensuring that the initiative is sustained by the industry directly associated with gambling.

Salinas emphasized that this legislative effort not only seeks to provide immediate relief and recovery options for affected individuals but also aims to educate and prevent future incidents of gambling addiction in American society. As more states explore gambling expansion, the urgency for proactive measures has never been clearer.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tracey Mann, R-KS, has introduced legislation aimed at transferring the responsibilities of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) related to the Food for Peace Act to the Department of Agriculture. This move, outlined in H.R. 1207, seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of food aid in the U.S. and improve coordination among federal agencies.

The Food for Peace Act, established to alleviate hunger and enhance food security on a global scale, has been managed by USAID for decades. Advocates for the bill argue that the oversight and implementation of this program would be more effectively managed within the Department of Agriculture, which has extensive experience in agricultural development and food distribution. By consolidating these functions, the legislation aims to streamline processes and better respond to food assistance needs.

This transition comes in response to ongoing challenges in global food security exacerbated by conflicts, climate change, and economic instability. The proposed shift seeks to reinforce the U.S. government's ability to respond to such crises quickly and effectively, ultimately aiming to improve humanitarian outcomes in affected regions. The bill would allow the Department of Agriculture to take on the existing statutory authorities previously held by USAID, including rules, regulations, and funding mechanisms that support food assistance.

Furthermore, Rep. Mann's initiative signals a strategic pivot toward a more integrated approach to food aid, aligning food production strategies and humanitarian efforts. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture for further consideration. As debates surrounding food security and international aid intensify, stakeholders will closely follow the bill's trajectory through Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kim Schrier, D-WA, has introduced the Forest Data Modernization Act aimed at enhancing the United States' forest inventory and analysis program. This legislation is designed to update the methods and technologies used for collecting and analyzing forest data, with a strong emphasis on carbon metrics, ultimately fostering more sustainable forest management practices.

The Forest Data Modernization Act comes in response to growing concerns about climate change and the critical role forests play in carbon sequestration. By improving the accuracy and accessibility of forest data, the bill seeks to strengthen efforts in managing forest resources effectively. It mandates updates to the existing inventory systems, incorporating advanced remote sensing technologies and new data collection methods such as timber products output studies and national woodland owner surveys.

The legislation proposes a strategic plan that will enhance data collection processes, ensuring they are consistent at the national level. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for collaboration with federal agencies and private sectors to leverage existing data sets and technologies. Such improvements are expected to increase efficiency, transparency, and precision in forest management, ultimately benefitting environmental sustainability efforts nationwide.

Historically, the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 provided a foundational framework for forest data analysis. However, as the landscape of environmental science progresses, so too must the methodologies used to understand and report on forest health and sustainability. The Forest Data Modernization Act aligns with these evolving needs, striving to ensure data accuracy that supports effective policy-making for forest conservation.

This bill has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture, where it will undergo further scrutiny and discussion to address its potential impact on forestry and environmental management in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act, a legislative measure aimed at halting federal funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). The bill proposes that funds typically allocated to these organizations be redirected to reduce the national public debt.

The measure responds to ongoing debates regarding the efficiency and necessity of taxpayer funding for public broadcasting entities. Advocates of the bill argue that such funding represents a misuse of public resources, as they believe these organizations often exhibit a partisan bias. By abolishing federal support, the bill seeks to encourage these media outlets to rely on voluntary subscriptions and donations, thereby promoting financial independence.

Should this bill pass into law, it aims to enforce restrictions on federal funding immediately, prohibiting any direct or indirect financial support for PBS and NPR. Furthermore, any funds that would have been allocated to these organizations over the next three fiscal years would instead be transferred to a designated account intended to alleviate the public debt. Proponents argue this could significantly reduce the fiscal burden on taxpayers.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. If enacted, it could mark a significant shift in how public media is funded and may lead to broader discussions on the role of government in media financing. Supporters of public broadcasting, however, may contend that this move undermines essential media services that inform and connect communities. As the legislative process unfolds, the implications of the Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act are likely to be a focal point in ongoing debates about media funding and accountability in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Julia Brownley, D-CA, has introduced the DRIVE Act of 2025, which seeks to increase the mileage reimbursement rate provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans' health-related travel. This legislative initiative aims to address the financial burdens faced by veterans who travel long distances for healthcare services.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when veterans across the country are struggling with rising transportation costs. Current reimbursement rates, which have remained stagnant for years, do not adequately cover the expenses of fuel and vehicle maintenance. The DRIVE Act proposes to align the VA's mileage rate with that of government employees, ensuring that veterans are compensated fairly for their travel expenses.

If enacted, the DRIVE Act will significantly impact many veterans, particularly those who live in rural areas where accessing medical facilities can require extensive travel. By enhancing financial support for transportation, the bill helps ensure that veterans can seek necessary care without the added stress of financial strain. The proposed legislation also emphasizes timely processing of travel allowances, mandating that reimbursements be issued within 90 days of a claim submission, a move aimed at improving the overall efficiency of the VA's support systems.

The DRIVE Act of 2025 has garnered broad support, with a number of co-sponsors from both parties, reflecting a unified commitment to addressing the needs of veterans. As the legislative session progresses, the bill will be reviewed by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where advocates hope it will pave the way for meaningful reforms in how the VA compensates veterans for their travel.

Michelle Fischbach, R-MN, has introduced the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act, a bill aimed at preventing the Secretary of Health and Human Services from enforcing new minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities.

The bill seeks to address what supporters claim are overly stringent requirements that could negatively impact the availability and quality of care for seniors. Proponents argue that the proposed staffing regulations could lead to increased operational costs for care facilities, potentially leading some to close their doors or limit services. Fischbach's legislation is designed to protect those facilities from what she describes as unnecessary regulatory burdens that might compromise care availability.

The context behind this bill stems from ongoing debates about the adequacy of care in long-term facilities and the balance between regulatory oversight and operational feasibility. Advocates for senior citizens argue that while staffing is crucial for high-quality care, regulations must also consider the practical realities that facilities face daily. There is significant concern among some lawmakers and stakeholders that excessive regulations may inadvertently harm seniors' access to necessary services instead of improving care standards.

If passed, the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act would provide immediate relief to long-term care facilities by halting the enforcement of the contested rule. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce for further review. As the legislative process unfolds, the bill is expected to prompt discussions on how best to balance the needs of seniors with the operational realities of care facilities.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1317",40434,"Rep. Joyce Introduces I CAN Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David P. Joyce, R-OH, has introduced the I CAN Act, aimed at increasing access to healthcare services provided by advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) under Medicare and Medicaid programs. The legislation seeks to remove existing barriers that limit these healthcare providers’ ability to deliver essential care, particularly in underserved communities.

This bill responds to a growing recognition of the vital role APRNs play in the healthcare system, especially as the U.S. grapples with a shortage of primary care physicians. By enhancing the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives, the I CAN Act aims to improve patient outcomes and expand healthcare access nationwide. The legislation encompasses provisions for a range of services, including hospice care, cardiac rehabilitation, and home health services, allowing APRNs to operate with greater autonomy and efficiency.

The potential impact of the I CAN Act is significant, particularly in rural and low-income areas where healthcare resources are often scarce. By empowering APRNs, the bill is designed to bridge the gaps in care, ensuring that patients have timely access to critical health services. Supporters argue that this approach not only enhances patient care but also alleviates pressure on the healthcare system as it shifts towards a more integrated and collaborative model.

The I CAN Act has garnered bipartisan support, with several co-sponsors joining Rep. Joyce in recognizing the urgent need for policy changes that reflect the evolving landscape of healthcare delivery. By facilitating a more inclusive environment for APRNs, the bill is expected to foster innovation and improve healthcare efficiency, ultimately working towards better healthcare for all Americans.

The bill (H.R. 1317) introduced on 02/13/2025 has 8 co-sponsors: Rep. Bonamici, Suzanne [D-OR-1]...02/13/2025; Rep. Kiggans, Jennifer A. [R-VA-2]...02/13/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250218-hr1401",40434,"Rep. Biggs Introduces Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act, aiming to enhance the efficiency of coin production while saving taxpayers money. The legislation seeks to suspend the production of the penny for a decade, arguing that sufficient coins already exist to meet current demand.

The bill responds to ongoing concerns about the financial viability of minting the one-cent coin, which has been deemed costly for taxpayers. By temporarily halting its production, supporters believe substantial savings can be achieved, reallocating those resources toward more pressing financial needs. The legislation stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury will cease minting new one-cent coins, with an exception made solely for numismatic purposes, ensuring collectors can still acquire these coins.

Additionally, this initiative places a spotlight on broader issues within the U.S. financial system, advocating for modernizing currency management. With inflation consistently impacting small denominations like the penny, the bill prompts a reevaluation of outdated monetary practices. By reducing unnecessary production costs, the proposal not only seeks to save taxpayers money but also encourages more efficient governmental resource allocation.

The timing of this bill comes amid persistent debates over the role of physical currency in an increasingly digital economy. Many argue that the penny's diminishing purchasing power contributes to its obsolescence, sparking discussions around currency optimization. Should the Currency Optimization Act go into effect, it could reflect a significant shift in monetary policy, resonating with both fiscal conservatives seeking accountability and progressives advocating for sustainable economic practices.

Rep. Biggs has garnered support from several co-sponsors, indicating a growing consensus around the necessity for change within the U.S. financial landscape. The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on Financial Services.

The bill (H.R. 1401) introduced on 02/18/2025 has 5 co-sponsors: Rep. Ciscomani, Juan [R-AZ-6]...02/18/2025; Rep. Moore, Barry [R-AL-1]...02/18/2025; Rep. Weber, Randy K. Sr. [R-TX-14]...02/18/2025; Rep. Boebert, Lauren [R-CO-4]...02/18/2025; Rep. Biggs, Sheri [R-SC-3]...03/11/2025.

"$H billintroh-250218-hr1426",40434,"Rep. Mackenzie Introduces Child Care Credit Enhancement Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-PA, has introduced legislation aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to enhance the financial support available for household and dependent care services. This move is designed to increase the tax credits available for child care services, thereby easing the financial burden on families.

The bill proposes doubling the current credit limits under Section 21, which pertains to household and dependent care expenses, raising the maximum allowable from $3,000 to $6,000 for one qualifying individual, and from $6,000 to $12,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. Additionally, the bill aims to substantially increase the cap on the employer-provided child care credit from $150,000 to $400,000. This measure seeks to incentivize businesses to offer child care benefits to their employees, a pressing need amid rising child care costs.

Mackenzie’s proposal comes as families continue to face significant financial challenges, particularly in the post-COVID economic landscape. Many parents struggle to balance work obligations with the responsibilities of child care, making affordable options vital to workforce participation. By enhancing these tax credits, the bill aims to provide much-needed relief to families while potentially boosting workplace productivity through improved employee satisfaction.

This initiative reflects a broader recognition among lawmakers of the critical role that accessible and affordable child care plays in fostering a strong economy. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, and its passage could significantly impact the financial capabilities of working families in Pennsylvania and across the nation.

The bill (H.R. 1426) was introduced on 02/18/2025.

"$H billintroh-250224-hr1522",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Federal Retirement Fairness Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Federal Retirement Fairness Act, aimed at amending the United States Code to allow temporary civilian service performed after December 31, 1988, to be credited under the Federal Employees Retirement System. This bill, introduced on February 24, 2025, seeks to rectify an inconsistency in retirement benefits that has impacted many federal employees.

The primary motivation for the bill arises from the recognition that temporary workers contribute significantly to government operations, often serving in critical roles without receiving the same retirement credit as permanent employees. By permitting credit for temporary service after 1988, the legislation aims to offer greater equity in federal retirement benefits. This change could affect numerous employees, particularly those in the U.S. Postal Service and other federal agencies who have served in temporary capacities.

The potential impact of the Federal Retirement Fairness Act is substantial. By extending retirement credit, the bill not only recognizes the valuable contributions of temporary workers but may also enhance recruitment and retention within the federal workforce. Enabling a broader range of employees to qualify for retirement benefits could help attract qualified individuals in a competitive job market.

The legislation has garnered initial support, with cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, illustrating a bipartisan acknowledgment of the need for reform in federal retirement policies. If passed, the Act would empower the Office of Personnel Management to notify eligible employees and implement necessary regulations to ensure smooth access to these benefits.

As Congress reviews the bill, discussions around improving the fairness and inclusivity of federal retirement systems are expected to continue, reflecting a growing commitment to support the diverse workforce serving the nation.

"$H billintroh-250224-hr1532",40434,"Rep. Matsui Introduces Scientific EXPERT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Doris Matsui, D-CA, has introduced the Scientific External Process for Educated Review of Therapeutics Act of 2025, commonly referred to as the Scientific EXPERT Act. The bill aims to enhance the drug development process by establishing externally led, science-focused meetings to address the challenges faced by developers of treatments for rare diseases and conditions.

The introduction of this bill is in response to the significant hurdles encountered in bringing therapies for rare conditions to market. These challenges often stem from inconsistent regulatory guidance, a lack of alignment among stakeholders, and limited understanding of the unique scientific issues involved in rare disease drug development. The proposed Act seeks to create a structured forum for collaboration between medical experts, drug sponsors, and patient representatives to facilitate discussions on critical scientific approaches that can expedite drug approval processes.

One of the central features of the bill is the requirement for at least four external, science-focused drug development meetings each year, organized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation in partnership with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These meetings will focus on identifying scientific strategies to tackle development problems and ensure that novel treatments are brought to patients as quickly as possible. By creating a multidisciplinary steering committee, the act endeavors to bring diverse perspectives to drug development discussions, ultimately aiming to align scientific approaches across the board.

The act also includes provisions for transparency, mandating public reports on meeting outcomes and how participant feedback influences FDA decision-making. With an authorized budget of $1 million each year until 2030, this initiative underscores a commitment to addressing unmet medical needs and improving health outcomes for patients with rare diseases.

The bill (H.R. 1532) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1559",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act aimed at extending the right of appeal to certain United States Postal Service (USPS) employees. This bill specifically targets those employees not represented by bargaining representatives, allowing them to appeal disciplinary actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The introduction of this bill stems from ongoing concerns regarding employee rights within the USPS. Many employees feel vulnerable in their positions due to a lack of recourse against management decisions. By granting these individuals access to an appeal process, the proposed legislation seeks to enhance job security and fairness in disciplinary matters for USPS employees.

This amendment would deepen protections for supervisory, professional, technical, clerical, administrative, or managerial roles not covered by existing bargaining agreements. By broadening appeal rights, the bill could potentially influence workplace morale and productivity, reassuring employees that their concerns will be heard and addressed.

Historically, USPS employees have had limited avenues for contesting actions taken against them, often resulting in a perceived imbalance of power between management and staff. The new measure is positioned as a corrective step in promoting equitable treatment within federal employment structures.

Rep. Connolly's initiative responds to calls from various employee advocacy groups and reflects a growing awareness of the necessity for robust protections for federal workers' rights. As this legislation makes its way through the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, its eventual outcome could set a precedent for enhancing employee relations across federal agencies. If passed, the amendment could fortify a more transparent and equitable work environment within the USPS.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Postal Supervisors and Managers Fairness Act, aimed at reforming the negotiation procedures for pay and benefits of supervisory and managerial personnel within the United States Postal Service (USPS). This legislation seeks to enhance fairness and transparency in these critical negotiations.

The need for this legislation arises from ongoing concerns regarding the pay structures and benefits available to postal supervisors and managers. Currently, the process lacks clarity and effectiveness, which can lead to dissatisfaction among employees and may impact service quality. By establishing more formal protocols for negotiation and communication, the act seeks to ensure that postal managers receive equitable compensation relative to their responsibilities.

If enacted, the bill will mandate that the USPS provide proposals for changes in pay policies and fringe benefits to supervisors' organizations at least 60 days before any existing agreements expire. This ensures timely communication and gives supervisors the opportunity to address any grievances or requests effectively. Additionally, the bill proposes a streamlined dispute resolution process, requiring that any recommendations made by the negotiation panel be finalized within 15 days, thus promoting efficiency.

This legislation comes amidst broader discussions surrounding postal service reform and budget considerations. It highlights the importance of adequately compensating leadership roles within USPS to retain talent and maintain operational integrity. Enhancing the negotiation framework is expected to bolster workforce morale and, in turn, improve service delivery to the public.

The Postal Supervisors and Managers Fairness Act was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. Its advancement will be closely monitored as part of the ongoing dialogue about the future of the USPS.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-CT, has introduced Ethan's Law, a bill aimed at enhancing firearm safety by mandating secure storage for firearms in households, particularly where minors reside. This legislation seeks to mitigate the alarming rates of gun-related incidents among children, including accidental shootings and youth suicides.

The introduction of Ethan's Law comes in response to concerning statistics indicating that millions of minors live in homes with unsecured firearms. According to recent studies, nearly 4.6 million children have access to unsecured firearms, heightening the risk of both unintentional shootings and deliberate self-harm. The bill aligns with growing calls for stricter gun safety measures in light of numerous tragic incidents and public sentiment advocating for the protection of children.

If enacted, the legislation would require firearm owners to store their weapons securely to prevent access by minors or individuals legally prohibited from possessing firearms. Violators could face fines and penalties, and firearms found to be improperly stored would be subject to seizure. Ethan's Law also allocates funding for states that implement similar safe storage laws, encouraging local governments to adopt measures that reflect its provisions.

As the bill progresses through Congress, its proponents emphasize the critical necessity of secure firearm storage to protect children and communities from the consequences of preventable gun violence. By addressing this pressing issue, Ethan's Law aims not only to enhance public safety but also to cultivate responsible gun ownership practices across the nation. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the Empowering Families in Special Education Act to enhance the rights of parents in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process for children with disabilities. This legislation aims to ensure that parents are adequately notified of their ability to include knowledgeable individuals in IEP meetings, fostering a more collaborative and informed approach to special education.

The need for this bill arises from longstanding concerns among parents and educational advocates regarding inefficiencies in the current IEP process. Many parents report feeling excluded and unaware of their rights during crucial discussions that impact their children's education. By mandating notification about participation rights, this bill seeks to empower families and ensure that their voices are heard in the decision-making process.

Should this bill pass, it has the potential to transform the IEP meetings, making them more inclusive and effective. With clearer communication and increased participation, parents will be better equipped to advocate for their children's needs, ultimately leading to improved educational outcomes. This aligns with the broader direction of recent educational reforms aimed at increasing parental involvement in special education.

Currently, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further deliberation. Educational advocates are hopeful for bipartisan support on this measure, which reflects a growing recognition of the importance of parental engagement in fostering better educational environments for children with disabilities. The Empowering Families in Special Education Act represents a step forward in fostering inclusive educational practices and ensuring that all children receive the support they deserve.

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1574",40434,"Rep. Moran Introduces RESTORE Patent Rights Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nathaniel Moran, R-TX, has introduced the RESTORE Patent Rights Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at strengthening patent protections in the United States. This bill aims to establish a rebuttable presumption that permanent injunctions should be granted in patent infringement cases, thereby enhancing the ability of patent owners to protect their innovations from unauthorized use.

The RESTORE Patent Rights Act responds to concerns that recent court decisions have weakened the traditional equitable practice of granting injunctions against patent infringement. Proponents argue that the inability to secure such injunctions has disproportionately affected inventors, startups, and smaller enterprises, creating an environment where large corporations can infringe on patents without significant consequences. By reinstating this presumption, the bill seeks to maintain competitive advantages for American innovation in the global economy.

The legislation highlights the Founding Fathers’ intent to secure exclusive rights for inventors as a means to promote scientific progress. With the current legal landscape making it difficult to enforce patent rights, Moran's bill emphasizes the necessity for robust protections to incentivize innovation and entrepreneurial investment. It asserts that reclaiming the traditional rights of patent holders not only protects individual inventors but ensures fair competition in the marketplace.

In a climate where intellectual property theft can undermine emerging technology sectors, the RESTORE Patent Rights Act stands to reinvigorate the patent system. If enacted, this legislation would align the U.S. judiciary with historical practices, allowing inventors to efficiently seek legal remedies against infringement. The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it is expected to undergo further scrutiny and debate ahead of potential approval.

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1575",40434,"Rep. Newhouse Introduces No American Land for Communist China Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-WA, has introduced the No American Land for Communist China Act, which aims to prohibit the purchase of real estate near federal lands by nationals and entities associated with the People's Republic of China. This legislation responds to growing concerns about national security and foreign influence on American land ownership.

The key intention behind the bill is to safeguard U.S. interests by preventing potential adversarial control over strategically located properties. Lawmakers believe that limiting Chinese ownership could mitigate risks associated with espionage and foreign interference, especially in sensitive areas adjacent to military and federally managed lands. 

This introduction comes amid rising tensions between the United States and China, particularly concerning trade relations and security threats. The increasing scrutiny of foreign investments, particularly from state-affiliated enterprises, reflects a broader push among lawmakers to bolster national security protocols. 

The proposed measure would grant the President authority to take necessary actions to enforce these prohibitions, particularly against any Chinese government agents or businesses with significant Chinese governmental ownership. This includes firms where the Chinese government holds 25% or more equity interest. 

The bill has garnered considerable attention, with bipartisan support highlighting the urgency of addressing foreign ownership of American resources. Lawmakers assert that failure to act could lead to compromised national interests and increased vulnerability to foreign influence.

As the bill proceeds through the legislative process, its implications for foreign investments in real estate will be closely examined. If enacted, it represents a significant shift in how the U.S. manages land ownership and foreign investments, placing national security at the forefront of real estate policy.

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1583",40434,"Rep. Tenney Introduces PAR Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Parity for Athletic Recreation Act (PAR Act) to amend the Internal Revenue Code, specifically aimed at removing restrictions on funding for certain private and commercial golf courses and country clubs. The proposed legislation intends to allow proceeds from various obligations to support these recreational facilities, which have thus far been excluded under current guidelines.

The introduction of the PAR Act comes as lawmakers seek to level the playing field for recreational venues, particularly following the growing interest in golf and similar activities post-pandemic. By lifting these restrictions, the bill aims to enhance funding opportunities for private and commercial golf facilities, potentially leading to increased investment in community sports and recreation.

Advocates for the bill argue that the current limitations hinder the ability of these venues to thrive financially, thereby affecting local economies and limiting access to outdoor recreational activities. Golf courses and country clubs often serve as community hubs, providing not just sports facilities but also social and networking opportunities for residents.

Moreover, the proposed changes are seen as a step toward promoting healthy lifestyles through athletic engagement. By making it easier to fund and maintain these infrastructures, the PAR Act could encourage communities to prioritize recreational activities, which in turn supports public health initiatives.

Should this bill advance through Congress, it is predicted to have wide-ranging implications for both the economy and community health through the revitalization of local golf and recreational facilities. For now, the PAR Act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation.

The bill (H.R. 1583) introduced on 02/25/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Panetta, Jimmy [D-CA-19]...02/25/2025; Rep. Hudson, Richard [R-NC-9]...02/25/2025.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1589",40434,"Rep. Garcia Introduces American Dream and Promise Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-TX, has introduced the American Dream and Promise Act, a legislative effort aimed at providing a pathway to permanent residency for certain undocumented immigrants, particularly those who arrived in the U.S. as children and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The bill seeks to address immigration reform by enabling eligible individuals to apply for conditional permanent resident status, increasing much-needed stability within these communities.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to ongoing discussions about immigration policy and the need for more humane and productive measures. The American Dream and Promise Act is designed to protect the rights of individuals who have built their lives in the U.S. and contribute to society while aiding in family reunification efforts and enhancing educational opportunities. 

If passed, the legislation would allow recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others meeting specific criteria to gain conditional permanent residency. This act differentiates itself from previous proposals by identifying distinct pathways for long-term residents and TPS holders, thereby addressing varying immigration circumstances with tailored solutions.

Proponents argue that the bill's successful enactment could have a significant economic impact, as it may allow thousands of individuals to work legally in the U.S. and contribute tax revenue, subsequently benefiting the economy. They emphasize that these immigrants have become integral community members, and their stories reflect a commitment to the values embedded in American society. 

The American Dream and Promise Act highlights the continued challenges of immigration reform in the U.S., representing a potential bipartisan opportunity to create a more inclusive immigration framework. The bill has been referred to the Judiciary and Education and Workforce committees for further consideration and debate.

The bill (H.R. 1589) introduced on 02/26/2025 has 202 co-sponsors.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1600",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Crimea Annexation Non-Recognition Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Crimea Annexation Non-Recognition Act, aiming to reinforce U.S. non-recognition of Russia's sovereignty claims over Crimea. This landmark legislation is designed to explicitly prohibit any federal acknowledgment of Russia's hold over the region, including its airspace and territorial waters.

The bill responds to ongoing concerns about Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which has been widely condemned by the international community. Following this annexation, Ukraine and its allies have faced significant geopolitical challenges, and the act seeks to solidify a strong stance against what is viewed as illegal occupation. By formally codifying this policy, the legislation aims to ensure that no federal department or agency may take actions that could imply U.S. recognition of Russia's claim.

This bill has the potential to influence U.S. diplomatic and economic relations with Russia. It underlines a commitment to maintaining international norms and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The non-recognition policy also serves as a reminder to the international community about the importance of collective responses to violations of international law.

Rep. Connolly is joined by several co-sponsors, including Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), indicating bipartisan support for the initiative. Supporters argue that failing to address Russia's actions could embolden further aggression in the region, destabilizing Eastern Europe and beyond. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration, its enactment would represent a critical reaffirmation of U.S. policy regarding Crimea and Russian intervention in Ukrainian sovereignty.

The bill (H.R. 1600) introduced on 02/26/2025 has 11 co-sponsors: Rep. Wilson, Joe [R-SC-2]...02/26/2025; Rep. Goldman, Daniel S. [D-NY-10]...02/26/2025; Rep. Fitzpatrick, Brian K.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1602",40434,"Rep. Davidson Introduces Financial Privacy Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, has introduced the Financial Privacy Act of 2025, aiming to enhance transparency and protections regarding Bank Secrecy Act reports. This legislation is designed to address growing concerns about the vast amounts of personal financial data collected by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and ensure the confidential handling of sensitive information about ordinary Americans.

The introduction of this bill follows heightened scrutiny of how the Bank Secrecy Act has been applied over the years. The law currently mandates the collection of millions of reports, including suspicious activity reports that capture personal information primarily with the intention of combating illicit finance. However, critics argue that much of this data lacks a legitimate connection to law enforcement objectives, potentially compromising individuals' privacy rights.

The Financial Privacy Act seeks to rectify these concerns by necessitating annual reports from the Secretary of the Treasury to Congress, detailing the types and volumes of reports filed. The proposed legislation also calls for a review of existing protocols to ensure that data handling aligns with national security and law enforcement needs while safeguarding civil liberties.

Should this bill progress, it could mandate crucial changes in how agencies access and retain financial information, providing more robust safeguards against unauthorized disclosures. By focusing on transparency, the legislation emphasizes balancing the fight against financial crime with the privacy rights of individuals, a topic of increasing relevance in today’s data-driven society.

This bill has been referred to the House Financial Services Committee, where it will undergo further examination and amendment before being put to a vote. If enacted, the Financial Privacy Act of 2025 would mark a significant shift toward protecting financial privacy for Americans across the nation.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1613",40434,"Rep. Houlahan Introduces Protecting Mushroom Farmers Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-PA, has introduced the Protecting Mushroom Farmers Act, aimed at establishing a framework for federal crop insurance specifically designed to protect mushroom producers. This initiative seeks to enhance the economic stability of mushroom farming, a significant agricultural sector in Pennsylvania and across the nation.

The bill was prompted by growing concerns among mushroom farmers about the unique vulnerabilities they face, including threats from pests, fungal pathogens, and severe weather conditions. By requiring the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to research and develop comprehensive insurance policies for mushroom production, the bill aims to provide financial security and support to these farmers who contribute substantially to local economies.

If passed, the legislation will direct the Corporation to not only investigate various insurance options but also assess the applicability of policy measures that consider risks associated with mushroom growing media. The need for tailored insurance has been underscored by anecdotal evidence that current policies often overlook the specific needs of mushroom growers, leaving them at financial risk during adverse conditions.

The potential positive impact of this legislation could be significant, as it seeks to protect revenue streams for mushroom farmers in the face of unpredictable agricultural challenges. The research mandated by the bill will explore streamlined reporting processes, loss mitigation strategies, and the prospective bundling of coverage for different stages of mushroom production.

Mushroom farming plays a vital role in securing jobs and sustaining rural communities, and this legislative proposal has garnered attention for recognizing and addressing the unique hurdles faced by this sector. The Protecting Mushroom Farmers Act represents a proactive step toward safeguarding an essential part of the agricultural landscape.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1619",40434,"Rep. Mace Introduces No Funds for Fascists Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, introduced the No Funds for Fascists Act on February 26, 2025, aimed at prohibiting U.S. foreign assistance to governments that infringe upon free speech rights protected by the U.S. Constitution. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

The new legislative initiative responds to growing concerns regarding international censorship and human rights abuses. Recent global events have highlighted instances where foreign governments have suppressed free expression, an action the proposed law seeks to counteract through financial measures. By restricting U.S. aid, the bill aims to pressure foreign entities into aligning with democratic principles, specifically protecting individual rights to free speech.

Under this legislation, if the Secretary of State determines that any foreign government censors or abridges free speech, no U.S. assistance can be provided to that government. This encompasses any form of communication aimed at coercing media platforms into censorship. An exception would exist for national security interests, requiring presidential approval and congressional briefing before any waiver of this funding prohibition is enacted.

The introduction of the No Funds for Fascists Act stems from a wider movement among lawmakers advocating for accountability in nations that violate fundamental rights. Its supporters believe that U.S. resources should not be allocated to regimes that fail to uphold basic democratic values. The potential impact of this measure includes reinforcing U.S. foreign policy focused on human rights, encouraging countries to improve their treatment of free speech, and resetting American diplomacy to prioritize democratic standards.

As the bill goes through the legislative process, it reflects an assertive stance against oppression globally and signals a pivotal shift in the U.S. approach to international aid.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1627",40434,"Rep. Norcross Introduces TREATS Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Donald Norcross, D-NJ, has introduced the TREATS Act, aimed at expanding telehealth services in the treatment of substance use disorders. This legislation seeks to amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow practitioners to conduct telehealth evaluations for patients requiring controlled substances for addiction therapy.

The urgency for the TREATS Act arises from the ongoing opioid crisis and the challenges faced by patients seeking treatment. Many individuals encounter barriers like transportation issues or lack of access to in-person healthcare. By enabling telehealth evaluations, the bill aims to provide a more accessible route for patients to receive necessary prescriptions, especially for those in underserved areas. The introduction of this bill follows a growing consensus on the efficacy of telehealth, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted its potential to connect patients with healthcare providers remotely.

Should the TREATS Act pass, it could dramatically increase the availability of treatment options for those struggling with substance use disorders. Allowing telehealth evaluations is expected to streamline the process, making it easier for practitioners to prescribe medications while ensuring compliance with federal regulations. Furthermore, the definition of telehealth evaluation included in the bill emphasizes the use of reliable telecommunications systems for real-time interaction, ensuring that patients receive high-quality care despite geographical limitations.

The TREATS Act has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Judiciary. As the legislation moves forward, it has garnered attention from various stakeholders in the healthcare community, who advocate for policies that facilitate timely and effective treatment for addiction.

"$H billintroh-250226-hr1628",40434,"Rep. Palmer Introduces 761st Tank Battalion Congressional Gold Medal Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gary J. Palmer, R-AL, has introduced the 761st Tank Battalion Congressional Gold Medal Act to honor the contributions of the 761st Tank Battalion during World War II. This legislation seeks to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the unit, recognizing their pivotal role in the success of Allied forces in Europe and their distinction as the first predominantly Black armored battalion in U.S. military history.

Established in 1942, the 761st Tank Battalion, known as the “Black Panthers,” fought valiantly in several key battles, including the Battle of the Bulge. Their efforts helped secure victories that were instrumental to the success of the Allies. However, racism was pervasive, and members faced significant prejudice both during and after their service. Despite the challenges, the battalion demonstrated exceptional bravery, engaging in 183 days of continuous combat without a break, ultimately inflicting approximately 130,000 casualties on enemy forces.

The introduction of this bill underscores a growing recognition of the need to acknowledge the contributions of marginalized groups in military history. Previous honors for the battalion included a Presidential Unit Citation in 1978, which came more than three decades after their deactivation. The proposed medal serves as further recognition for their courageous service and sacrifices during a time of widespread segregation.

If passed, this measure will allow the medal to be presented in a ceremony arranged by Congress and subsequently displayed at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The bill reflects efforts not only to celebrate the battalion’s historic role but also to address past injustices faced by Black veterans returning home.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Innovation Act, a legislative initiative aimed at accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources across the United States. The bill seeks to provide tax incentives for companies investing in clean energy technologies and to enhance funding for research and development in this vital sector.

The Clean Energy Innovation Act comes in response to growing concerns about climate change and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As extreme weather events increase in frequency and severity, the bill emphasizes the importance of shifting away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. By stimulating innovation, the legislation aims to create jobs and promote economic growth while also addressing environmental challenges.

If enacted, the bill is expected to significantly boost the development of renewable energy projects nationwide. Supporters argue that by making clean energy more financially viable, the U.S. can lead in global efforts to combat climate change, reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels, and enhance energy security. This initiative aligns with President Biden's broader climate goals and helps meet international commitments under various climate accords.

In addition to providing tax credits, the Clean Energy Innovation Act proposes grants for universities and research institutions focused on developing cutting-edge technologies that improve energy efficiency. This move highlights the growing intersection between education, research, and sustainable development in the pursuit of a greener economy.

The introduction of this bill marks a critical step by lawmakers to confront the pressing environmental issues facing the nation and demonstrates a commitment to fostering a sustainable energy future while encouraging economic opportunities across various sectors.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1661",40434,"Rep. Buchanan Introduces SAFE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-FL, has introduced the SAFE Act of 2025, legislation aimed at prohibiting the slaughter of horses for human consumption in the United States. This bill seeks to amend the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, extending existing protections that already cover dogs and cats to include equines.

The motivation behind this legislation stems from mounting concerns about the welfare of horses, particularly those abandoned or in crisis situations. Advocates argue that horses, regarded as companions and athletes, deserve humane treatment and protection against slaughter for consumption. Currently, the U.S. has no operational horse slaughterhouses, but advocates wish to prevent any potential resurgence of such practices. 

With public sentiment increasingly shifting against horse slaughter, the SAFE Act aligns with broader animal rights movements advocating legislative changes for better treatment of equines. If passed, the bill could signify a profound shift in policy, establishing stronger protective measures for horses across the nation.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, not only for animal welfare advocates but also for equine owners and organizations dedicated to horse care. By ensuring horses are treated as companions rather than commodities, the act promotes a cultural transition toward viewing horses in the context of companionship and partnership. 

Additionally, the bill has already garnered bipartisan support, with a wide array of co-sponsors from various states, indicating a strong coalition ready to advocate for equine welfare. As the bill moves through Congress, many will be watching its progress to ensure a future that prioritizes the humane treatment of these beloved animals.

"$H billintroh-250227-hr1678",40434,"Rep. Escobar Introduces Homeland Security Improvement Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-TX, has introduced the Homeland Security Improvement Act, aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bill seeks to establish an independent oversight commission to monitor border security activities and improve training for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to ongoing concerns regarding the treatment of individuals at the U.S.-Mexico border, which has faced increased scrutiny due to reports of human rights violations. The Homeland Security Improvement Act aims to address these issues by creating a Department of Homeland Security Border Oversight Commission. This commission, comprising individuals with expertise in migration, civil rights, and community relations, will review border enforcement policies and training programs to safeguard the rights of those affected by immigration enforcement.

One of the key components of the act is the establishment of an Ombudsman for Border and Immigration-Related Concerns. This office will provide a neutral channel for complaints regarding DHS’s activities and ensure thorough investigations are conducted. It is also designed to enhance communication between border communities and enforcement agencies, fostering cooperation and trust.

By requiring enhanced training for CBP agents, the bill intends to focus on improving professional conduct and de-escalation practices to minimize conflict. Reports of migrant deaths and the impact of enforcement strategies on border communities will also be evaluated, aiming to create safer environments.

In addition to increasing accountability, the legislation seeks to develop a standardized complaint process that protects individuals from retaliation and ensures their grievances are adequately addressed. This comprehensive approach signals a significant shift towards prioritizing civil rights and community engagement in U.S. border security policies.

The bill (H.R. 1678) was introduced on 02/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250103-hr168",40434,"Rep. Wilson Introduces Comprehensive Mental Health Support Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Wilson, D-CA, has introduced the Comprehensive Mental Health Support Act, aimed at expanding mental health resources for underserved communities across the nation. This legislative initiative seeks to allocate federal funds to enhance mental health services, improve access to care, and promote awareness of mental health issues.

The need for this bill arises from a mounting mental health crisis in the United States, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports indicate a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders, particularly among vulnerable populations. Wilson's bill proposes establishing community-based mental health clinics, which would serve low-income regions lacking adequate mental health support. The initiative includes training programs for health professionals, ensuring they are equipped to address diverse mental health challenges effectively.

The Comprehensive Mental Health Support Act is also designed to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health. By promoting public education campaigns, the bill intends to foster an environment where individuals feel safe seeking help and discussing mental health openly. The integration of mental health education into school curriculums and workplace training programs is also a critical aspect of the proposed legislation.

Furthermore, the bill outlines provisions for telehealth services, enabling patients to receive care remotely. This component is particularly vital in light of the continuing challenges posed by the pandemic and aligns with the ongoing shift toward digital healthcare.

If passed, the Comprehensive Mental Health Support Act is expected to significantly improve mental health outcomes across the country, particularly for marginalized communities. Wilson's efforts reflect a growing recognition of the importance of mental health as an integral part of overall well-being and healthcare policy. This bill represents a crucial step in addressing disparities in mental health services and ensuring that all Americans have access to the care they need.

"$H billintroh-250113-hr356",40434,"Rep. Norton Introduces District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act, aiming to transfer prosecution authority for local law violations from federal oversight to local prosecutor’s office. The bill, presented on January 13, 2025, seeks to enhance the autonomy of D.C.’s legal system by allowing a designated local prosecutor to manage prosecutions under local laws.

The legislation stems from longstanding discussions regarding the governance of the District of Columbia, which lacks full congressional voting representation. By empowering a local prosecutor to handle prosecutions, the bill addresses concerns about federal interference in local matters and promotes a more localized approach to law enforcement. Advocates argue that this shift will improve accountability and responsiveness to the community's needs.

If passed, the act would amend the D.C. Official Code, enabling the local prosecutor’s office to conduct prosecutions for various ordinances and regulations. While the bill does not remove the federal government's authority in certain matters, it significantly reduces its role in local prosecutions, a change that supporters believe will foster greater effectiveness and efficiency in the legal process.

The potential impact of this bill is considerable, as D.C. residents would gain more control over their judicial system. This legislative move signifies a recognition of the unique status of the District and its citizens' desire for local governance. The bill is currently pending review by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with significant implications for D.C.’s legal framework awaiting further legislative action.

"$H billintroh-250113-hr374",40434,"Rep. Tenney Introduces DIRECT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the DIRECT Act, legislation aimed at redirecting funds originally allocated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) towards enhancing border security through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This bill seeks to rescind unobligated balances previously granted for IRS enforcement activities under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The introduction of the DIRECT Act comes at a time when border security remains a major national concern. With increasing calls for a focus on immigration enforcement, Tenney’s initiative appears designed to reallocate resources to bolster border protection through the hiring of new agents and officers. By shifting these funds from the IRS to the CBP, the bill highlights an ongoing debate over the government's priorities in economic and national security.

If enacted, the bill would specifically retro-allocate the unobligated funds for IRS enforcement activities to support the recruitment of additional personnel for securing the U.S. southern border. This move underscores the urgency perceived by some lawmakers regarding the current state of border security and the perceived need for increased manpower at CBP.

The DIRECT Act has been referred to both the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. If successful, it may set a precedent for future budget reallocations within the federal government as discussions surrounding the management of taxpayer funds continue.

With public interest in immigration policy at an all-time high, the implications of this bill will likely resonate through discussions in Congress as it navigates through committee reviews and potential debates on the House floor. The outcome of this legislation could have significant impacts on how resources are allocated to federal agencies in response to pressing national issues.

"$H billintroh-250103-hr179",40434,"Rep. McClintock Introduces Proven Forest Management Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, has introduced the Proven Forest Management Act of 2025, aiming to enhance forest management practices on National Forest System lands. This initiative is designed to improve coordination among stakeholders during forest management activities to achieve sustainable ecological benefits.

Aimed primarily at addressing pressing environmental challenges, the bill emphasizes reducing forest fuels, maintaining biodiversity, and improving water quality in vulnerable regions. With increasing forest fire incidents and rising concerns about climate change, the legislation seeks to implement comprehensive forest management strategies that are both efficient and effective. The act mandates that relevant parties be consulted in forest management decisions, ensuring that local and state governments, as well as community representatives, play an integral role in ecological stewardship.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, promoting not only healthier forest ecosystems but also fostering collaboration among various stakeholders. It aims to reduce the costs associated with forest management while simultaneously enhancing the resilience of forests to climate change. The act will allow for specific management practices to be categorically excluded from extensive environmental assessment processes, streamlining operations that are deemed crucial for immediate ecological benefits.

Historically, U.S. forest management policies have shifted towards ensuring more robust collaborations between agencies and local entities. The Proven Forest Management Act reflects these ongoing trends by reinforcing the importance of collective action in natural resource management. McClintock's proposed legislation is expected to generate dialogue and engagement among diverse stakeholders, ultimately aiming to create a sustainable future for national forests. As the bill moves through Congress, its reception will likely hinge on balancing ecological health with resource management efficiency.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-CA, has introduced the Targeted Operations to Remove Catastrophic Hazards Act (TORCH Act), aimed at enhancing forest management strategies to mitigate the growing risks of catastrophic wildfires across the United States. This legislation seeks to empower the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior in implementing comprehensive measures designed to reduce wildfire hazards effectively.

The TORCH Act comes in response to the alarming increase in wildfire occurrences and intensity in recent years, which have devastated ecosystems, communities, and wildlife. By streamlining forest management practices, this bill intends to facilitate timely and effective action in combating the threat of wildfires. Key provisions include the ability to remove hazardous trees and increase the use of grazing as a strategy for fuel reduction.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, particularly in regions prone to extreme fire hazards. It allows for categorical exclusions of certain environmental assessments, expediting the process for high-priority activities without sacrificing environmental protections. Through these amendments, the bill aims to improve response times to wildfire risks while allowing for collaboration with states and local authorities to maximize effectiveness.

Prior legislation, such as the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, highlighted the need for comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategies. The TORCH Act builds upon these efforts by increasing acreage limits for restoration projects and integrating new methods for managing utility vegetation near fire-prone areas. As wildfires continue to pose significant threats to both human life and ecological balance, this legislation signals a proactive approach to forest management amid a changing climate, prioritizing community safety and environmental resilience.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act, a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at transferring prosecutorial powers for local violations in the District of Columbia to a designated local prosecutor’s office. The bill, presented on January 13, 2025, seeks to streamline the prosecution of municipal crimes and enable local authorities to manage these cases without dependence on federal oversight.

The impetus for this legislation stems from a growing sentiment among residents and local leaders advocating for greater home-rule authority in D.C. Currently, the U.S. Attorney's Office oversees prosecutorial duties for local laws, a scenario seen as an impediment to effective governance. Proponents argue that allowing a local prosecutor to handle these cases will lead to more efficient adjudication and a stronger connection between local laws and the community.

If enacted, this act will significantly alter the structure of legal authority in the District. It would empower the designated local prosecutor’s office to handle all police or municipal ordinance violations, thereby localizing the decision-making process within D.C.'s justice system. Additionally, the bill maintains the authority of the federal government and U.S. Attorney for serious offenses, ensuring a continued balance of powers.

This initiative marks a substantial step towards enhancing the autonomy of local governance in Washington, D.C., which has historically been shaped by federal oversight. As the city continues to navigate its unique identity and challenges, the proposed legislation represents a critical move towards a more locally oriented legal framework that could redefine the role of public safety and justice in the nation’s capital.

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1559",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act, a legislative measure aimed at extending the right of appeal to certain employees of the United States Postal Service (USPS) to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This act intends to provide additional protections and avenues for these employees to contest adverse employment actions.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst growing concerns over the treatment of USPS employees, particularly those in supervisory and managerial positions who are not represented by a bargaining unit. Currently, these employees lack robust appeal rights, which has led to calls for reform to ensure fair treatment and due process in the workplace. The proposed legislation seeks to address this gap by allowing non-represented USPS employees to appeal their cases to the MSPB, thereby aligning their rights more closely with those of other federal employees.

The impact of this bill could be significant, potentially improving job satisfaction and morale among USPS employees by empowering them with the right to challenge unfavorable decisions. This amendment acknowledges the unique employment situation within USPS, where many employees face challenges distinct from those in other government sectors.

Rep. Connolly's initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance employee rights and welfare across federal agencies. By strengthening protections for postal workers, the bill aims to foster a more equitable workplace, underscoring the importance of accountability and transparency in federal employment practices. As the legislation progresses, it will be scrutinized by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where its implications for federal workforce management will be thoroughly evaluated.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-VA, has introduced the LEASH DOGE Act, a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability within the Department of Government Efficiency, commonly referred to as DOGE. This bill mandates the department to deliver detailed reports concerning its personnel and activities, addressing a growing concern regarding government operation efficiency.

The introduction of the LEASH DOGE Act follows increasing calls from both constituents and lawmakers for greater oversight of government operations. The legislation aims not only to provide a comprehensive roster of DOGE employees but also to ensure that the public can access information about their roles, security clearances, and any potential conflicts of interest. By establishing a public website with this data, the act seeks to foster a culture of transparency and rebuild trust between the government and the citizens it serves.

Under the provisions of the LEASH DOGE Act, the head of DOGE will be required to present a report to Congress detailing the qualifications and backgrounds of employees. This report will also include statements about the accessibility of personally identifiable information within the agency and whether background checks were performed for its staff. Moreover, the act stipulates that DOGE’s leadership must appear before congressional committees to discuss past and future departmental activities, reinforcing legislative oversight.

The implications of this legislation are substantial. By promoting transparency, the LEASH DOGE Act strives to mitigate public concerns over government efficacy and promote informed citizen engagement. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be categorized under the oversight committee, where it can be further evaluated for its potential impact on government efficiency and accountability.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Doris O. Matsui, D-CA, has introduced the “Scientific External Process for Educated Review of Therapeutics Act of 2025,” commonly known as the Scientific EXPERT Act. This legislative proposal aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by establishing a structured process for externally led, science-focused drug development meetings to enhance collaboration between medical experts, drug sponsors, and patient organizations regarding rare diseases.

The Scientific EXPERT Act was introduced in response to the growing need for effective drug development processes addressing rare diseases, conditions often overlooked due to limited patient populations. By facilitating discussions on scientific challenges and innovative solutions, the bill seeks to streamline the drug approval process, ultimately increasing treatment options for patients facing unmet medical needs.

Under this proposed act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services would create a systematic approach for annual science-focused drug meetings, with at least four convened each year addressing various rare diseases. This initiative will be supported by a permanent steering committee comprising representatives from the FDA, medical experts, industry leaders, and patient advocates to ensure diverse input and guidance throughout the process.

The bill could significantly impact drug development timelines, helping align clinical trial designs and metrics while incorporating stakeholder feedback directly into regulatory decision-making. By mandating the publication of meeting outcomes, the EXPERT Act promotes transparency and encourages ongoing dialogue among all parties involved in drug development.

With a proposed budget of $1 million annually from 2026 to 2030, the Scientific EXPERT Act emphasizes the necessity for strategic investment in innovative therapeutic solutions, aiming to foster advancements in the fight against rare diseases.

"$H billintroh-250224-hr1522",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Federal Retirement Fairness Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Federal Retirement Fairness Act, a legislative measure aimed at amending Title 5 of the United States Code. This bill seeks to allow federal employees who previously served in temporary positions after December 31, 1988, to count this service toward their creditable service benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns among federal workers who have long felt disadvantaged by the existing retirement regulations, which have excluded temporary service from their retirement calculations. Proponents argue that recognizing temporary employment as creditable service reflects the commitment and contribution those workers have made to federal service and ensures fair treatment within the retirement system.

Should this bill become law, it would significantly impact federal workers, potentially benefiting thousands who previously served in temporary roles that did not offer retirement credit. The bill calls for the Office of Personnel Management to notify eligible employees and establishes a framework for appropriate regulatory adjustments. By removing the previous cutoff date, Connolly's initiative provides a pathway for equity within federal retirement benefits, a key issue for many government employees.

The Federal Retirement Fairness Act has garnered bipartisan support since its introduction, with co-sponsors from both parties recognizing the need for reform to better serve the interests of federal workers. Standing on the principles of fairness and recognition, this bill aims to address deficiencies in the current retirement system, aligning it more closely with the realities faced by many federal employees today. If passed, federal agencies may soon see a new wave of eligible participants seeking to secure their retirement futures.

The bill (H.R. 1522) introduced on 02/24/2025 has 76 co-sponsors: Rep. Valadao, David G. [R-CA-22]...02/24/2025; Rep. Budzinski, Nikki [D-IL-13]...02/24/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250218-hr1401",40434,"Rep. Biggs Introduces Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Biggs, R-AZ, has introduced the Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act of 2025, a bill aimed at suspending the production of one-cent coins in a bid to reduce taxpayer costs and optimize the manufacturing and distribution of currency.

The proposed legislation highlights the financial drain of producing pennies, asserting that sufficient quantities already exist to meet demand for the next decade. By halting production, the bill aims to save taxpayers from unnecessary expenses associated with the minting of these coins, which have become increasingly costly to produce relative to their face value. The bill also includes provisions for the ongoing production of pennies solely for numismatic collectors, ensuring that the needs of collectors are met without burdening taxpayers further.

If passed, the act would implement a ten-year suspension of one-cent coin production, underscoring the need for a more efficient approach to coin currency in the United States. This move comes amid growing discussions about the practicality of maintaining lower denomination coins in a digital and cashless society. 

Proponents of the bill argue that consumers and businesses alike would benefit from the proposed changes, as it would streamline transactions and encourage the use of electronic payment methods over physical coins. The potential impacts of this bill resonate particularly in an age where many transactions are conducted digitally, making pennies less relevant.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further review. As Congress grapples with various financial challenges, this legislation may serve as a critical step toward modernizing the nation’s currency approach while fostering national savings.

The bill (H.R. 1401) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1317",40434,"Rep. Joyce Introduces I CAN Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David P. Joyce, R-OH, has introduced the Improving Care and Access to Nurses Act, commonly referred to as the I CAN Act, aimed at enhancing healthcare access by removing barriers for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) within the Medicare and Medicaid frameworks. The bill seeks to streamline practices, expand access to essential health services, and empower nurse practitioners (NPs), certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) to perform their functions with fewer restrictions.

The I CAN Act comes in response to ongoing challenges faced by healthcare specialists, particularly in rural and underserved areas, where access to qualified medical professionals is crucial. By broadening the scope of practice for APRNs, proponents believe that patient outcomes can significantly improve, especially among vulnerable populations requiring timely medical attention. The reforms stipulated in the bill would authorize NPs, CRNAs, and CNMs to offer a wider array of services, including managing chronic conditions, prescriptive authority, and facilitating smoother transitions of care in various healthcare settings.

The bill is structured to dismantle outdated supervisory requirements and payment barriers that currently limit the practice capabilities of these healthcare providers. For instance, it includes adjustments that allow NPs to certify patient eligibility for Medicare services and permits CRNAs to bill for evaluation and management services directly. Additionally, provisions aimed at increasing access to hospice care services and enhancing the availability of home health options reflect an evolving healthcare landscape that values the versatility and training of advanced practice nurses.

By advancing the I CAN Act, Rep. Joyce and supporting legislators aim not only to improve healthcare delivery in Ohio but to set a precedent for similar legislative efforts nationwide, reinforcing the critical role of APRNs in the American healthcare system.

The bill (H.R. 1317) introduced on 02/13/2025 has 8 co-sponsors: Rep. Bonamici, Suzanne [D-OR-1]...02/13/2025; Rep. Kiggans, Jennifer A. [R-VA-2]...02/13/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1303",40434,"Rep. Fischbach Introduces Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-MN, has introduced the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act, aimed at preventing the Secretary of Health and Human Services from enforcing new minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities. The legislation, introduced on February 13, 2025, seeks to address concerns raised by the long-term care community about the proposed regulations and their implications for service delivery.

This bill was prompted by the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on May 10, 2024, which outlined minimum staffing requirements that many argue could lead to significant operational challenges within long-term care settings. Critics of the new regulations contend that the staffing mandates could force facilities to reduce services or close altogether, directly impacting the accessibility of care for seniors. Rep. Fischbach's legislation reflects a growing worry among lawmakers that these requirements may compromise the quality of care rather than enhance it.

The potential impact of this bill is substantial, particularly for older adults relying on long-term care services. By prohibiting the enforcement of these staffing standards, the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act aims to ensure that facilities can maintain their current staffing practices, which supporters argue better aligns with patient needs and operational realities.

The bill has been referred to both the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee for further consideration. Its introduction highlights a critical debate in U.S. healthcare policy regarding the balance between regulatory oversight and the practical challenges faced by healthcare providers. As discussions progress, stakeholders from various sectors will be closely monitoring the implications of this legislative effort on care standards for the nation’s seniors.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1288",40434,"Rep. Brownley Introduces DRIVE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Julia Brownley, D-CA, has introduced the Driver Reimbursement Increase for Veteran Equity Act of 2025 (commonly referred to as the DRIVE Act). This legislation aims to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to increase the mileage reimbursement rate for veterans traveling for health-related purposes through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The DRIVE Act comes at a critical time as veterans continue to face rising costs associated with travel, particularly those journeying to receive medical care. Currently, the reimbursement rate for mileage under the VA's Beneficiary Travel program does not adequately reflect the expenses incurred by veterans. The proposed legislation seeks to align this rate with the mileage reimbursement for government employees using their personal vehicles for official duties. By doing so, it aims to reduce the financial burden on veterans, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their travel.

The legislation is expected to have a significant positive impact on veterans who often travel long distances to access necessary health services. Travel reimbursement is a crucial support mechanism that allows veterans to seek care without having to worry about the costs. As healthcare becomes increasingly integral to veteran wellbeing, ensuring adequate travel reimbursements can improve access and overall health outcomes.

In addition to raising the reimbursement rate, the DRIVE Act mandates timely processing of allowances, requiring the VA to issue payments within 90 days of a veteran submitting a proper request. This provision aims to enhance efficiency within the department, ensuring veterans do not experience unnecessary delays in receiving their owed reimbursements.

The DRIVE Act has garnered bipartisan support, indicating a collective commitment to improving the quality of life for veterans. As the bill moves through the legislative process, its success will be closely watched by veteran support groups and advocates working tirelessly to address the needs of this essential community.

The bill (H.R. 1288) introduced on 02/13/2025 has 20 co-sponsors: Rep. Tlaib, Rashida [D-MI-12]...02/13/2025; Rep. Crenshaw, Dan [R-TX-2]...02/13/2025; Rep. Vargas, Juan [D-CA-52]...02/13/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250211-hr1216",40434,"Rep. Tenney Introduces Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced a new piece of legislation aimed at halting federal funding for public broadcasting entities, namely the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). The proposed bill seeks to repurpose the allocated funds to reduce the national debt, marking a significant shift in federal media financing.

The Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act emerges amid ongoing debates surrounding the role of public media in the U.S. Critics argue that federally funded outlets like PBS and NPR produce biased content, while supporters contend these platforms provide essential educational programming that serves diverse communities. Tenney’s initiative reflects a growing sentiment among certain lawmakers to eliminate what they view as government overreach into media that influences public opinion.

This bill's impact could be substantial, as it would not only cut off federal financial support for these organizations but also redirect millions in federal funding—estimated from allocations traditionally given to PBS and NPR—toward addressing public debt. If enacted, it would affect budgets and operations, potentially leading to programming cuts and job losses within these institutions.

Historically, public broadcasting has relied heavily on federal grants, citing the need for sustainability in delivering quality content. Critics of the bill argue that defunding could undermine the journalistic integrity of public media, reducing the availability of unbiased news. As the legislation proceeds through the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, it is likely to provoke intense discussions, with advocates on both sides preparing to voice their concerns.

The introduction of this bill underscores the divisive landscape of media funding in America, as lawmakers grapple with balancing fiscal responsibility and the preservation of public service media. As the 119th Congress continues, the outcomes of such legislation remain uncertain.

The bill (H.R. 1216) introduced on 02/11/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Biggs, Andy [R-AZ-5]...02/12/2025; Rep. Harris, Mark [R-NC-8]...03/03/2025; Rep. Van Orden, Derrick [R-WI-3]...03/25/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kim Schrier, D-WA, has introduced the Forest Data Modernization Act, aiming to enhance forest inventory and analysis methods in an effort to improve data collection on national forest resources. The bill seeks to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978, focusing specifically on updating methods of evaluating forest carbon and other essential data metrics.

The introduction of this bill comes at a critical time as environmental concerns related to climate change heighten the need for more accurate forestry data. By integrating advanced technologies, including remote sensing and machine learning, the proposed legislation aims to produce more precise statistics about forest conditions and carbon stocks. The new requirements under this act mandate the Secretary of Agriculture to incorporate practices that will enhance data collection’s consistency and statistical precision.

One of the key objectives of the Act is to address the growing significance of forest carbon in climate discussions. With forest areas serving as crucial carbon sinks, having updated and reliable data is vital for understanding their role in combating climate change. The bill would facilitate national woodland owner surveys and timber product output studies, offering a more comprehensive overview of forest resources.

Furthermore, the legislation emphasizes accessibility to collected data for public and private sector entities, enhancing transparency. It also mandates regular updates to strategic plans focusing on trends in forest carbon and collaborative efforts among various stakeholders, which could greatly benefit forest management and conservation strategies nationwide.

Schrier's initiative underscores a proactive approach to forest management, prioritizing better data to guide policy and resource allocation toward sustainable forest practices in the face of changing environmental conditions.

"$H billintroh-250211-hr1207",40434,"Rep. Mann Introduces Food for Peace Act Transfer Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tracey Mann, R-KS, has introduced legislation to transfer the responsibilities of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) regarding the Food for Peace Act to the Department of Agriculture. This initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. food aid programs by consolidating oversight under a single department.

The proposed bill is designed to streamline operations and improve coordination among government agencies dealing with food security. By transferring USAID's functions related to the Food for Peace Act to the Department of Agriculture, the bill seeks to leverage the Agriculture Department's extensive experience in agricultural stewardship and food distribution. This move is intended to ensure a more cohesive approach to combatting hunger and enhancing food aid efforts both domestically and internationally.

The rationale behind the introduction of this bill stems from ongoing concerns surrounding food insecurity, which has been exacerbated by global crises such as conflicts, economic instability, and climate change. By consolidating operations, Rep. Mann's bill aims to eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies that can hinder timely responses to crises that lead to food shortages.

The potential impacts of this legislation are far-reaching. It seeks to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. food assistance, ensuring aid reaches those most in need more quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, the bill includes provisions for the continued operation of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a vital resource for providing critical intelligence on developing food shortages.

This legislation has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Agriculture Committee for further deliberation, reflecting its significance in addressing food security issues in both domestic and international contexts.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-OR, has introduced the Gambling Addiction Recovery, Investment, and Treatment Act, a legislative initiative aimed at enhancing support for individuals suffering from gambling addiction in the United States. This bill, introduced on February 7, 2025, seeks to authorize grants to state governments for the development and implementation of programs addressing gambling-related issues.

The bill is a response to the growing recognition of gambling addiction as a significant public health concern, especially in light of the expansion of legalized gambling across the country. As the landscape for gambling changes, so do the challenges related to addiction, prompting lawmakers to consider new funding mechanisms to support prevention and recovery efforts. The Gambling Addiction Recovery Act aims to reduce the stigma surrounding gambling addiction and provide essential resources for those affected.

Under this act, the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use would administer formula grants to states based on established allocations for substance abuse prevention grants. Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse would have the authority to fund research focused on understanding and treating gambling addiction, enhancing the overall effectiveness of support services.

The potential impact of this legislation could be substantial, as it aims to create a comprehensive approach to tackle gambling addiction, which affects millions of Americans. By providing states with the necessary funding, the bill encourages the development of tailored treatment programs and outreach initiatives.

Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-WA, has introduced the Flight 293 Remembrance Act, a legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive database of Armed Forces members who died in non-combat military plane crashes. The bill seeks to ensure that families of these servicemen and women receive the necessary support and resources during their time of mourning.

The Flight 293 Remembrance Act addresses a long-overlooked issue within the military community, recognizing that service members tragically lose their lives in non-combat scenarios yet often do not receive the same level of recognition or support as those who die in active combat. The bill mandates that the Department of Defense track and document all non-combat military plane crashes dating back to 1984, thereby creating a publicly accessible database listing the names, ranks, and service records of all fallen personnel.

This initiative is designed not only to honor those who have lost their lives but also to provide family support mechanisms, offering guidance on navigating benefits and resources available through the military and other support networks. By establishing a designated point of contact within the Defense Department, families will be better equipped to access financial assistance, counseling, and survivor benefits tailored specifically for non-combat losses.

The introduction of the Flight 293 Remembrance Act comes at a time when awareness of veteran support needs is increasing, with advocates emphasizing the importance of recognizing and addressing the unique challenges faced by families of service members lost to non-combat incidents. This legislation promises to enhance the support structure for these families, ensuring that their sacrifices are remembered and honored.

"$H billintroh-250205-hr1006",40434,"Rep. Joyce Introduces Higher Education Accountability Tax Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David P. Joyce, R-OH, has introduced the Higher Education Accountability Tax Act aimed at modifying the excise tax regulations for private colleges and universities. The proposed legislation significantly raises the tax rate on investment income from these institutions, moving from 1.4 percent to 10 percent, with an additional 10 percent rate for those that have increased their net price beyond the Consumer Price Index in the previous three years.

The bill emerges amid rising concerns over tuition affordability, particularly as many private colleges have seen substantial hikes in their pricing structures. By increasing the taxation on surplus investment income of affluent educational institutions, the act intends to hold them accountable for cost increases impacting students and families. The revenue generated from this tax would be redirected to support grants and programs aimed at making higher education more accessible.

The bill stipulates that institutions with a net price hike exceeding inflation over a three-year period will incur additional taxation. This provision targets colleges that disproportionately raise costs, influencing decisions regarding tuition rates and financial transparency. Furthermore, the legislation expands the scope of taxable institutions by lowering the threshold from $500,000 to $250,000 in investment income.

Joyce's initiative has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. Experts suggest that while the act could deter excessive price increases and promote financial accountability, it may also invoke resistance from educational leaders wary of the financial implications. This bill represents a significant shift in policy on higher education funding and affordability, as lawmakers grapple with the complexities of tuition and educational investment nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, has introduced the Proven Forest Management Act aimed at enhancing forest management practices on National Forest System lands. The bill mandates greater coordination between the federal government and local stakeholders to ensure that forest management activities effectively address ecological challenges while maintaining community interests.

The Proven Forest Management Act comes amid growing concerns over forest management failures leading to catastrophic wildfires and environmental degradation. By involving local governments and interest groups in decision-making processes, the legislation seeks to create tailored management strategies that benefit both ecosystems and the communities dependent on these lands.

Key provisions of the bill emphasize the need for forest management activities to yield multiple ecological advantages, such as improving water quality and fostering biological diversity. It also offers a categorical exclusion from the National Environmental Policy Act for certain forest management projects, streamlining the process for projects that focus on reducing forest fuels. This move is expected to expedite crucial activities aimed at preventing the widespread devastation of wildfires.

Economic implications of the Proven Forest Management Act are significant. By optimizing forest management, it can potentially protect property and reduce firefighting costs incurred during severe fire seasons. Furthermore, the legislation promotes collaboration between federal authorities and local entities, thereby supporting local economies through job creation in forest management and restoration initiatives.

The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Agriculture and Natural Resources for further consideration. As discussions unfold, stakeholders will closely watch how the proposed measures could reshape U.S. forest policy and enhance the resilience of these vital ecosystems against the impacts of climate change and wildfires.

"$H billintroh-250204-hr964",40434,"Rep. Sewell Introduces Rosa Parks Day Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Terri A. Sewell, D-AL, has introduced the Rosa Parks Day Act, aimed at establishing Rosa Parks Day as a federal holiday in the United States. The bill was presented to the House on February 4, 2025, and seeks to honor the legacy of the civil rights icon renowned for her pivotal role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst growing calls for the recognition of key figures in American history whose contributions to civil rights and social justice have been profound. By designating Rosa Parks Day as an official holiday, the legislation aims to honor not only Parks's courageous act of defiance but also to inspire future generations to continue the fight for equality and justice. Observing such a day on the national calendar is seen as a way to educate the public on the struggles and progress achieved in the realm of civil rights.

The potential impact of this legislation extends beyond mere recognition. Supporters argue that having a dedicated day to honor Rosa Parks can catalyze educational initiatives focusing on civil rights history and the importance of activism. It could also encourage communities to engage in discussions and activities that promote inclusion and equity.

The proposed federal holiday would add to the existing national holidays, with the amendment seeking to insert Rosa Parks Day into Section 6103 of Title 5, United States Code, immediately following Thanksgiving Day. The introduction of this bill reflects a commitment to ensuring that contributions to civil rights are not only acknowledged but celebrated at a national level, reinforcing the principles of justice and equality that Rosa Parks embodied.

"$H billintroh-250121-hr593",40434,"Rep. Tokuda Introduces Strengthening Pathways to Health Professions Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jill Tokuda, D-HI, has unveiled the Strengthening Pathways to Health Professions Act, a legislative initiative aimed at easing the financial burden on students pursuing careers in health professions. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude scholarship and loan repayments for specific health professions education from gross income, thus incentivizing more individuals to enter the healthcare field.

The introduction of this bill comes at a critical time as healthcare shortages persist across the nation, particularly in underserved areas. Tokuda's proposal targets students who would benefit from the exclusion of certain educational financial aids from taxable income, making it easier for them to navigate the high costs associated with medical training. By creating favorable tax treatment for these payments, the bill aims to bolster the workforce in crucial healthcare sectors.

Experts believe that the proposed changes could have a significant impact on healthcare accessibility. Many graduates refrain from pursuing careers in primary care or rural health due to the steep debts incurred during their education. By alleviating some of the tax burdens associated with repayment programs, the bill could help attract professionals to these high-need areas, ultimately improving patient care and health outcomes.

In addition to enhancing financial incentives for health professions, the Strengthening Pathways to Health Professions Act emphasizes the importance of tailored scholarship programs, particularly those addressing the unique needs of Native Hawaiian communities. This comprehensive approach underscores a commitment to not only expand the healthcare workforce but also ensure it is reflective of and responsive to the diverse populations it serves.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it will be reviewed before further consideration. The support and interest surrounding the legislation signal a growing recognition of the importance of strengthening America's healthcare network.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-NJ, has introduced a new piece of legislation aimed at amending title 32 of the United States Code, intending to clarify the limitations surrounding full-time National Guard duty performed within states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The bill, referred to as the Full-Time National Guard Duty Clarification Act, seeks to enhance the cooperation and consent required from state leadership before mobilizing National Guard units for federal operations.

The introduction of this bill responds to growing concerns regarding the jurisdictional authority over National Guard troops when called to active duty by federal authorities. It emphasizes that any operations involving full-time National Guard personnel must receive approval not only from the President or Secretary of Defense but also from the chief executive officer of the respective state. This provision aims to ensure that state interests and the authority of local leaders are respected during federal deployments.

If enacted, this legislation could significantly impact both the management of National Guard resources and the relationship between state officials and federal authorities. By mandating consent from state executives, the bill aims to prevent potential conflicts and ensure that state resources are used in accordance with local priorities and mandates. 

Furthermore, this legislation strengthens compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the ability of federal military personnel to act in a law enforcement capacity within the United States. This reassertion of the act's relevance underscores the ongoing need for clear boundaries between military and civilian jurisdictions, particularly in light of recent discussions about the role of the National Guard in domestic affairs.

Rep. Sherrill's bill is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Armed Services, highlighting its significance in contemporary military governance and state-federal relations.

"$H billintroh-250121-hr571",40434,"Rep. Griffith Introduces Child's Insurance Benefits Means-Testing Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-VA, has introduced new legislation aimed at amending the Social Security Act to means-test certain child’s insurance benefits. The proposed bill seeks to establish income thresholds that will determine eligibility for benefits provided to children of workers who receive Social Security insurance.

The Child's Insurance Benefits Means-Testing Act responds to growing concerns about the sustainability of Social Security programs amidst increasing national debt and changing demographic trends. By adjusting how benefits are distributed to families based on income, the legislation is designed to ensure that resources are allocated more effectively and equitably. Specifically, the bill will disallow children aged 18 or older from qualifying as full-time students for benefits if their parent—who is also receiving old-age or disability benefits—earns over $125,000 annually.

This legislative move could significantly impact families that rely on these benefits, particularly affecting those with higher incomes. Proponents argue that means-testing is a necessary step to preserve the integrity of Social Security, ensuring that assistance directs toward those who need it most. However, opponents express concerns that this could create financial pressure on families already struggling to support their children through education.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader Republican agenda focused on reforming entitlement programs to mitigate their financial strain on government resources. As the legislation moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means, it will undergo scrutiny and debate that could shape its provisions and determine its future. With the bipartisan conversation surrounding Social Security ongoing, this bill may be one of the numerous steps towards significant reform in the upcoming legislative sessions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, introduced a bill on January 16 that seeks to prohibit the use of federal funds for any properties or entities owned by Donald J. Trump. The Constitutional Emoluments Protection of American Interests Act of 2025 aims to safeguard public funds by ensuring that they are not directed towards any business dealings associated with the former president.

The legislative move comes in the wake of ongoing discussions regarding potential conflicts of interest tied to President Trump's extensive business empire. By restricting federal funds from being allocated to Trump's business interests, the bill addresses concerns raised about the constitutionality of allowing a sitting or former president to financially benefit from government expenditures. This measure is designed to foster transparency and reinforce the integrity of public office.

The implications of this bill could be significant. Should it pass, it would represent a fundamental shift in how federal funds are managed concerning personal business interests held by government officials. The bill lists numerous properties and businesses under Trump’s purview to ensure comprehensive coverage and avoidance of circumvention.

Introduced to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the bill reflects a growing bipartisan concern regarding ethical governance. History shows that discussions surrounding former presidents’ business operations have become increasingly contentious, especially as public scrutiny of financial practices continues to intensify.

As Congress deliberates on the bill, advocacy groups and watchdog organizations are likely to monitor its progress closely. The potential outcomes could set critical precedents regarding the separation of personal and public interests, shaping the political landscape for years to come.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, has announced the introduction of the Direct Hire To Fight Fires bill aimed at streamlining the federal hiring process for wildland firefighters and support positions. The bill seeks to amend existing federal regulations to enable quicker appointments within the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior, enabling a more efficient response to the growing wildfire threats across the nation.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, especially in Western states. By implementing a direct hire authority, the bill aims to address chronic staffing shortages that hinder effective wildfire management and response efforts. It is designed to expedite the recruitment process for critically needed positions, ensuring that trained personnel are readily available during peak fire seasons.

Should this bill pass, it would allow the secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to bypass standard hiring regulations for specific firefighting roles, facilitating immediate employment of qualified candidates. The proposed changes are expected to cut down lengthy recruitment timelines and reduce bureaucratic hurdles that have long plagued federal hiring practices in the wildland firefighting sector.

In addition to hiring reform, the bill mandates annual reporting to Congress, providing transparency about staffing needs, hiring events, and existing vacancies. These reports are intended to foster accountability and keep lawmakers informed of ongoing recruitment challenges within these vital agencies. The anticipated result is a more robust firefighting workforce, which stakeholders hope will lead to improved fire management and reduced risks to both communities and ecosystems at risk from wildfires.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the DIRECT Act, a legislative proposal aiming to redirect funding from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to bolster security measures at the U.S. southern border through increased staffing for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The bill seeks to rescind unobligated balances initially allocated to the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act for enforcement activities.

The introduction of the DIRECT Act is a response to ongoing concerns regarding border security, as lawmakers grapple with rising apprehension rates and the challenges posed by illegal immigration. Proponents argue that by reallocating these IRS resources, the bill would address urgent needs for enhanced border protection while minimizing perceived excesses within the IRS's budget. 

The potential impact of the DIRECT Act could be significant, potentially enabling the hiring of additional agents and officers tasked with the critical responsibility of securing the southern border. This reallocation is aimed at reinforcing national security at a time when many argue that CBP is stretched thin due to increasing migration challenges.

In terms of its legislative journey, the bill has been referred to both the Appropriations and Ways and Means committees, where it will be considered for provisions relevant to their jurisdictions. The DIRECT Act reflects a broader Republican strategy to prioritize border security funding over what they view as unnecessary IRS expansion.

As debates over immigration and border safety continue, the DIRECT Act stands as a bold step from Rep. Tenney, representing a call to action based on a key area of concern for her constituents and a priority for her party's agenda. If passed, the bill could reshape the federal funding landscape as it relates to border security and IRS operations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Postal Supervisors and Managers Fairness Act, aiming to modify the negotiation processes regarding pay and benefits for supervisory and managerial personnel within the United States Postal Service (USPS). This bill intends to enhance transparency and efficiency in the dealings between the USPS and its supervisory staff, thereby improving working conditions for this significant workforce.

The act was introduced in response to growing concerns among postal supervisors who have expressed dissatisfaction with existing negotiation frameworks that they argue are outdated and ineffective. By implementing new procedures that require the USPS to provide written proposals to supervisory organizations before any changes can occur, the bill seeks to create a more collaborative negotiating environment. It stipulates that requests for changes in pay policies must be presented at least 60 days in advance of expiration, ensuring ample time for discussion.

This legislative proposal has the potential to positively affect thousands of USPS employees who occupy supervisory roles, which could lead to a more stable workforce and improved employee morale. Currently, various unions representing postal workers have criticized the existing negotiation methods, pointing to inconsistencies and prolonged timelines as detrimental to employee satisfaction and performance.

Further, the bill aims to simplify dispute resolution by establishing clear timelines for decision-making. With a focus on timely recommendations from negotiation panels, it hopes to eliminate delays that often accompany disputes regarding pay and benefits. By addressing these issues, the Postal Supervisors and Managers Fairness Act seeks to create a fairer and more efficient workplace, benefiting both employees and the Postal Service's operational effectiveness.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, introduced the Proven Forest Management Act to enhance cooperation and efficiency in forest management activities on National Forest System lands. The bill aims to streamline practices while ensuring environmental benefits and coordination with affected communities.

The legislation responds to rising concerns over forest health and wildfire risks. With devastating wildfires becoming more frequent, this initiative seeks to establish clear guidelines for forest management while reducing the potential for catastrophic fires. By requiring coordination with local stakeholders, including governments and community organizations, the bill aims to ensure that forest management efforts reflect the interests and insights of those directly impacted by such activities.

The act outlines a framework wherein the Secretary of Agriculture collaborates with local entities to create forest management plans that prioritize multiple ecosystem benefits. These include reducing hazardous fuels, maintaining biodiversity, and improving water quality. In addition, the bill allows for certain forest management activities to bypass lengthy environmental review processes, streamlining efforts to implement urgent fire mitigation measures on up to 10,000 acres.

By encouraging local input, the Proven Forest Management Act is positioned to foster a more collaborative approach to public land stewardship. Proponents argue that engaging local stakeholders can enhance not only the effectiveness of forest management but also foster greater public trust in federal land practices.

As America grapples with the impacts of climate change and increasing forest wildfires, the bill places emphasis on efficient, proactive forest management strategies that promote resilience and sustainability. The legislation is part of a broader discourse concerning national efforts to protect and manage public lands effectively while prioritizing community engagement and safety.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-CA, has introduced the Targeted Operations to Remove Catastrophic Hazards Act, known as the TORCH Act, aimed at enhancing forest management practices to decrease the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The proposed legislation seeks to empower the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior to take more decisive actions in forest management, emphasizing the urgent need to mitigate wildfire risks exacerbated by climate change.

The TORCH Act was introduced in response to the growing incidence of devastating wildfires across the western United States. Recent years have seen an increase in wildfire activity, which poses significant risks to life, property, and natural resources. This bill proposes several key strategies, including the categorical exclusion for high-priority hazardous tree removal activities, streamlining the regulatory process to enable quicker responses to wildfire threats.

One of the central elements of the bill is the utilization of timber sales on National Forest System lands, allowing for the disposal of hazardous trees without extensive appraisal processes. The legislation also encourages grazing as a tool for wildfire risk reduction, thereby integrating both environmental stewardship and ranching practices to create a comprehensive wildfire management strategy.

Moreover, the TORCH Act aims to amend existing laws such as the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, increasing the allowable size of wildfire resilience projects from 3,000 to 10,000 acres. This change reflects an understanding that larger-scale approaches may yield more effective results in forest resilience and recovery.

As it advances through Congress, this bill represents a proactive approach to address the critical issue of fire management in the context of changing climatic conditions, balancing ecological needs with community safety and livelihood concerns.

The bill (H.R. 168) was introduced on 01/03/2025.
