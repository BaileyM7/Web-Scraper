WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Steve Womack, R-AR, introduced the Stephen Hacala Poppy Seed Safety Act on April 2, 2025, aiming to prevent the sale of contaminated poppy seeds in food products. This initiative targets health concerns associated with poppy seeds, which have been linked to several incidents of morphine intoxication, including the tragic case of Stephen Hacala, who died after consuming tainted seeds.

The bill responds to alarming evidence that contaminated poppy seeds have caused numerous health-related tragedies across the United States. Reports have indicated that at least 19 fatalities are attributable to morphine overdoses from poppy seeds, which can be laced with dangerous levels of opiate contaminants. Additionally, some women have faced unjust scrutiny from child welfare officials after testing positive for opiates shortly after childbirth, presumably due to consumption of poppy-seed-laden foods.

To address these issues, the legislation mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop and enforce contamination thresholds for morphine and other opiate alkaloids found in poppy seeds. This oversight seeks to classify seeds exceeding these contamination levels as adulterated substances, thereby banning them from interstate commerce. 

The urgency of this bill is highlighted by the Department of Defense's advisory to servicemembers to avoid consuming poppy seeds due to the risk of positive drug tests linked to contamination. As public awareness of food safety rises, the Stephen Hacala Poppy Seed Safety Act represents a critical step toward protecting consumers from potentially harmful food products. The bill is now under consideration by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The bill (H.R. 2615) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2614",40434,"Rep. Wilson Introduces Maximum Support Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Joe Wilson, R-SC, has introduced the Maximum Support Act, aimed at bolstering internet freedom and countering censorship in Iran. This legislation seeks to establish a comprehensive strategy supporting the Iranian people in their pursuit of democracy and human rights while enhancing their access to uncensored internet resources.

The proposed bill outlines several key initiatives to facilitate internet access for Iranian citizens. These measures include the creation of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service specifically designed for Iranians to bypass government censorship and leverage secure communications. Moreover, the legislation calls for enhanced satellite communications and direct-to-cell technology to ensure consistent access despite the Iranian government's restrictions on technology imports.

Amid ongoing protests against the Iranian regime, this bill seeks to address a growing urgency. Following the violent suppression of civil dissent and media censorship, U.S. lawmakers have recognized the need for more robust support mechanisms for Iran. By providing tools to counteract state-sponsored censorship, the Maximum Support Act aims to empower dissidents and civil society.

The impact of the bill could extend beyond internet access. It intends to confiscate Iranian government assets in the U.S. to fund initiatives promoting democracy, targeting institutions and organizations that undermine human rights. Further, the proposed measure would include rigorous audits to prevent funds from inadvertently benefitting the Iranian regime.

Rep. Wilson's initiative, informed by the experiences of the Iranian people, aligns with U.S. foreign policy goals of promoting democracy and human rights globally. The Maximum Support Act not only seeks to protect Iranian access to information but also represents a significant shift in how the U.S. engages with emerging digital freedoms in authoritarian contexts.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2612",40434,"Rep. Trahan Introduces DELETE Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Lori Trahan, D-MA, has introduced the DELETE Act, a landmark legislative measure designed to establish a centralized system enabling individuals to request the simultaneous deletion of their personal information from data brokers. This bill aims to enhance consumer privacy and simplify the increasingly complex landscape of digital data management.

The DELETE Act was introduced in response to growing concerns over privacy violations by data brokers, entities that collect and sell personal information without direct relationships with consumers. With an increasing reliance on digital platforms, individuals have found it difficult to control their personal data, leading to potential misuse and exploitation.

Under the DELETE Act, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be tasked with creating a centralized system that allows users to submit requests for data deletion. This would enable individuals to manage their privacy effectively, ensuring that once a deletion request is made, their personal data is removed from all registered data brokers. By allowing for a single submission to result in widespread data removal, the bill seeks to reduce the complexities and hurdles individuals face in protecting their personal information.

The act also mandates that data brokers register annually with the FTC, providing transparency about their data collection practices and allowing consumers to have clearer insight into how their information is being used. This registration includes a requirement that brokers disclose opt-out options to consumers, allowing them to take an active role in safeguarding their data.

If passed, the DELETE Act could usher in significant changes to data privacy norms in the U.S., offering consumers greater control over their digital footprints while holding data brokers accountable for their practices.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, has introduced the HOUTHI PC SMALL GROUP Act of 2025, aimed at strengthening national security by prohibiting the communication of classified information via mobile and desktop messaging applications. This legislative move is in response to growing concerns over the potential misuse of technology that may expose sensitive governmental data.

The bill addresses the increasing vulnerabilities stemming from digital communication tools, where classified information could be inadvertently shared or maliciously leaked. With rapid advancements in technology, security experts have raised alarm over the risks posed by unauthorized transmission of sensitive information through these platforms. By enacting stringent penalties, including fines and imprisonment for violators, the proposed legislation seeks to deter individuals from using insecure channels for classified communications.

This legislative initiative comes at a time when government agencies are enhancing their cybersecurity frameworks in light of numerous high-profile breaches. Enhancing safeguards around classified information is imperative, especially as adversaries become more sophisticated in their tactics of espionage and information theft. The Act would amend Title 18 of the United States Code, explicitly criminalizing the transmission of classified materials via unauthorized messaging applications.

The HOUTHI PC SMALL GROUP Act of 2025 underscores a bipartisan acknowledgment of the pressing need for robust measures to protect national security. As the House Judiciary Committee prepares to review the bill, its passage could significantly impact how federal agencies manage sensitive communications in an increasingly digital landscape. If enacted, this legislation would represent a significant step in securing classified information against modern threats.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2609",40434,"Rep. Schneider Introduces PEACE Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Bradley Schneider, D-IL, has introduced the PEACE Act, aimed at enhancing training for U.S. diplomatic personnel regarding the Abraham Accords and other normalization agreements with Israel. This legislative initiative, introduced on April 2, 2025, seeks to fortify understanding and implementation of these pivotal agreements to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.

The PEACE Act emerges in a context where U.S. engagement in the region has gained renewed focus following normalization efforts between Israel and several Arab nations. The bill emphasizes the necessity of equipping diplomats with in-depth knowledge about these agreements to effectively navigate and advance diplomatic relations. By proposing comprehensive educational programs at the Foreign Service Institute, the legislation aims to bolster the operational capabilities of U.S. personnel working in related diplomatic spheres.

One of the key components of the PEACE Act is the establishment of an Abraham Accords and Normalization Advisory Board, which will include experts in diplomacy and Middle Eastern studies. This board will provide independent recommendations to shape the curriculum for training relating to these pivotal agreements, ensuring that U.S. diplomats are well-versed in their complexities and implications.

The bill also authorizes fellowships for Foreign Service officers engaging with counterparts in countries that have normalized relations with Israel. This initiative is expected to foster deeper collaborations and understanding, reinforcing U.S. diplomatic efforts in the region.

By mandating a strategic approach to education on the Abraham Accords, the PEACE Act not only aspires to improve training quality but also seeks to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy in an increasingly interconnected global landscape. This legislation is part of broader efforts to ensure sustained engagement and peace-building initiatives in the Middle East.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2608",40434,"Rep. Roy Introduces Endangered Species Act Reform Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced a bill aimed at removing several species from the lists of threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed legislation seeks to revise the classifications of species such as the Arabian oryx, Eld's brow-antlered deer, and Grevy's zebra, asserting that some have recovered sufficiently to warrant their removal from federal protection.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing debates about the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act. Advocates for the bill argue that certain species have shown substantial population growth and should no longer be classified as endangered, thereby allowing for more flexible management practices. Proponents believe that de-listing these species could foster better land management strategies, particularly in regions where agricultural and developmental interests often conflict with conservation efforts.

The bill’s potential impact extends beyond species reclassification—supporters argue it could serve as a precedent for future reviews of endangered species listings, promoting a more adaptive approach to wildlife management. However, critics raise concerns that such actions could undermine conservation efforts and reverse hard-earned progress in species recovery.

The bill marks a significant step in the current Congress’s focus on natural resource management and could stir significant public and political debate as it is reviewed by the House Committee on Natural Resources. Should it advance, it will likely invoke discussions surrounding biodiversity preservation and the balance between economic development and environmental protection.

This legislative move underscores the contentious landscape of U.S. environmental policy, with implications that could reshape how endangered species are protected in the future.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2606",40434,"Rep. Mace Introduces Stop Importing Terrorism Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, has introduced the Stop Importing Terrorism Act, a significant legislative measure aimed at tightening U.S. immigration laws related to terrorism. The bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act by repealing specific exceptions that currently allow certain individuals with terrorist connections to enter the country.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing concerns about national security and the integrity of U.S. border policies. Proponents argue that the existing exceptions undermine efforts to keep potential threats out of the nation. This legislative action seeks to strengthen the criteria under which individuals can be deemed inadmissible based on terrorism-related grounds.

By eliminating this particular exception, the bill intends to close loopholes that have previously allowed individuals with historical ties to terrorism to obtain entry into the United States. This move is poised to have substantial implications not only for U.S. immigration policy but also for international relations and counter-terrorism efforts.

If passed, the legislation would result in the deportation of any individual who was admitted to the U.S. under the now-repealed exception since January 20, 2021. This has raised discussions among lawmakers about the balance between immigration enforcement and ensuring humanitarian protections for those in need.

The Stop Importing Terrorism Act has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, where it will undergo further scrutiny. As the debate unfolds, the bill underscores the ongoing discourse around national security in an increasingly complex global landscape, reflecting both the urgency and challenges of effective immigration policy.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2605",40434,"Rep. Luttrell Introduces SAVES Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-TX, has introduced the Service Dogs Assisting Veterans Act, known as the SAVES Act. This legislation aims to establish a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that would provide grants to nonprofit organizations specifically for supplying service dogs to eligible veterans.

The SAVES Act addresses an increasing need among veterans dealing with physical and psychological challenges by facilitating access to trained service dogs. These animals can provide critical support, enhancing their owners' independence and quality of life. With a growing awareness of veterans’ struggles, including PTSD and mobility issues, this initiative is positioned to significantly impact those who have served in the armed forces.

Under this bill, the VA would award grants of up to $2 million to qualified nonprofit entities over a five-year period. These organizations would not only provide service dogs but also offer training and additional support tailored to the unique needs of each veteran. The expected outcome is a more holistic approach to veteran care, integrating emotional support with traditional medical offerings.

The broader context for this legislation comes at a time when veterans' services face funding complexities and treatment gaps. With mental health resources limited in many regions, the SAVES Act proposes a practical solution by harnessing the power of trained service dogs, which have shown to offer emotional and psychological benefits. 

As the bill progresses through Congress, its advocates hope it will bring much-needed resources and support to veterans across the nation, fostering a transformative approach to veteran rehabilitation and care.

"$H billintroh-250402-hr2604",40434,"Rep. Lieu Introduces Protecting Data at the Border Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, recently introduced the Protecting Data at the Border Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at safeguarding the digital privacy of individuals as they enter and exit the United States. This bill seeks to establish clear legal protections against warrantless searches of electronic devices and online accounts at the nation’s borders.

The impetus for this legislation stems from growing concerns over the intrusion of personal privacy in the digital age. With the Supreme Court's recognition of digital privacy in its 2014 ruling in *Riley v. California*, the act underscores the importance of requiring government agencies to obtain a warrant based on probable cause before accessing the digital contents of devices or accounts. This legislative effort addresses a rising trend where border officials have increasingly accessed personal devices without stringent legal standards.

If enacted, the Protecting Data at the Border Act would prohibit U.S. government entities from accessing the digital content of electronic equipment without a valid warrant, significantly enhancing the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. citizens. The legislation also outlines specific procedures for government access during emergency situations, ensuring checks and balances are in place to prevent abuse of power.

The bill is designed not only to enhance privacy protections but also to restore public confidence in border security practices. As global travel resumes post-pandemic, the impact of this legislation could redefine how personal data is treated at borders, establishing a precedent for digital rights amidst evolving technology. The introduction of this bill reflects a broader conversation about balancing national security interests with individuals' rights to privacy in the digital realm. 

Rep. Lieu’s legislation has been referred to the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Darin LaHood, R-IL, has introduced the Small Business Tax Fairness and Compliance Simplification Act, aiming to amend tax regulations that affect the beauty service industry. The bill seeks to simplify reporting requirements and ease the burden of tax compliance, particularly related to tip reporting.

The initiative was introduced in response to growing concerns from small business owners in the beauty sector, who often face complex regulatory frameworks regarding tips. The legislation aims to promote tax compliance while reducing the reporting burdens that many beauty service establishments encounter. With many beauty professionals reliant on tips, the existing compliance measures can hinder operational efficiency and profitability.

This act includes provisions for an extended tip credit for employers in the beauty services field, allowing businesses to receive credit for a portion of the employer social security taxes paid on employee tips. Additionally, it establishes a tip reporting safe harbor for beauty service employers. This means that businesses that implement educational programs regarding tips and maintain necessary employee records will not face IRS examinations for tip compliance.

Furthermore, the bill mandates information reporting for rentals of beauty service spaces, requiring landlords to report rental income from beauty service providers. By creating clearer reporting obligations, the legislation aims to ensure compliance while encouraging growth within the beauty industry.

In an era where small businesses often struggle against stiff regulations, Rep. LaHood's bill underscores a commitment to supporting the beauty sector, which employs millions and is vital to local economies. The act is now referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-CA, has introduced the Delete DOGE Act, a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting the use of federal funds for the United States DOGE Service. This bill, introduced on April 2, 2025, seeks to rescind any financial allocations associated with the Department of Government Efficiency, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and reevaluation of government spending.

The Delete DOGE Act emerges amid growing concerns over the effectiveness of the DOGE initiative. Critics have pointed out that the program has not achieved its intended goals of enhancing governmental efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By cutting funding, the legislation aims to redirect attention toward more promising efficiency-enhancing measures while ensuring taxpayers’ money is utilized judiciously.

The implications of this bill extend beyond mere financial cuts. If passed, federal agencies would be barred from using allocated funds for any projects initiated by the DOGE, effectively halting the operations of the department entirely. This bold move reflects a significant stance against what many view as a bloated government initiative that fails to deliver tangible results. 

The Delete DOGE Act is currently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, in addition to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, inviting thorough scrutiny. Proponents of the bill argue that the federal government must prioritize accountability and efficiency, while opponents may contend that abolishing DOGE could jeopardize ongoing projects aimed at improving digital services across federal agencies.

As it stands, Jacobs' legislation underscores a growing bipartisan sentiment regarding government reform and fiscal accountability, suggesting a potential shift in how federal resources are allocated and administered moving forward.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-TX, has introduced the POWER Act of 2025, a legislative proposal aimed at establishing a tax credit for emergency generators purchased by individuals living in areas frequently affected by declared disasters. This initiative seeks to enhance community resilience and preparedness in the face of increasing natural disasters.

The bill aims to provide a tax credit of up to $500 for individuals who reside in regions that have experienced two or more major disasters in a five-year period. Such assistance is crucial as communities face more frequent and severe weather events, resulting in power outages that can endanger lives and property. By incentivizing individuals to invest in emergency generators, the legislation supports families in taking proactive measures to safeguard their homes during crises.

Hunt's introduction of the bill comes amid heightened concerns about natural disaster preparedness following recent catastrophic weather events across the country. The initiative aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress on how to effectively bolster disaster response and recovery efforts. With climate change contributing to the rising frequency of natural disasters, the POWER Act reflects a growing recognition that personal preparedness can significantly reduce strain on emergency services and government resources during crises.

If enacted, the bill would benefit individuals who receive federal disaster assistance and reside in high-risk areas, making this measure accessible to those who need it the most. As communities continue to grapple with the impacts of climate change, the POWER Act represents a step toward empowering residents to protect themselves and their families from future disruptions in vital services.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Jared Huffman, D-CA, has introduced the IDEA Full Funding Act, aimed at providing complete federal funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This legislation seeks to address long-standing funding gaps in special education, ensuring that states receive the necessary resources to adequately serve students with disabilities.

The IDEA Full Funding Act comes in response to the persistent underfunding of IDEA, which has left many schools struggling to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities. Currently, many states receive far less federal support than what is mandated by law, placing an undue financial burden on local districts and severely impacting the quality of education that students receive. By proposing a structured increase in federal funding over the next decade, the bill aims to alleviate this pressure and improve educational outcomes for all students.

If enacted, the legislation would implement a series of annual federal funding increases, ultimately achieving full funding within the next nine years. This includes gradually increasing allocations starting from 11.6% of the average per-pupil expenditure in fiscal year 2026 to 40% by fiscal year 2035. Such an increase could mean billions of additional dollars for schools nationwide, translating into better resources, more support staff, and enhanced educational programs tailored for students with disabilities.

Advocates argue that the bill is not only necessary for compliance with federal law but is also a moral obligation to ensure equity in education. Supporters of the IDEA Full Funding Act hope that by bridging this funding gap, students with disabilities will receive the high-quality education they deserve, ultimately leading to better long-term outcomes in their academic and career pursuits.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where its fate will be determined in the upcoming legislative sessions.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the MARALAGO Act, a legislative measure aimed at prohibiting the President of the United States from personally profiting from accommodations provided during Secret Service protection. The bill seeks to address concerns about the potential conflict of interest when federal funds are used for lodging or other expenses incurred at the President's residence.

The introduction of this bill comes in the wake of growing scrutiny surrounding the financial relationship between the governmental protective services and the residences of current and former Presidents. By limiting the ability of the federal government to reimburse the President for such services, the MARALAGO Act aims to eliminate any doubts about financial advantage that presidents might gain from their own residential properties. Advocates of the bill argue that this measure is essential to uphold the integrity of the office and ensure that taxpayer dollars are not redirected to benefit the President personally.

If enacted, the MARALAGO Act would prevent the Secret Service from using federal funds to purchase or lease accommodations from the President or their affiliated businesses. However, the bill allows for the gifting of such accommodations, indicating that while presidents cannot profit directly, they can voluntarily offer these services without charge. 

Cohen's initiative reflects broader conversations about ethical governance and the financial responsibilities of elected officials. As the bill progresses through the House Judiciary Committee, its implications could redefine certain operational protocols of presidential protection while reinforcing accountability in governmental spending practices.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-PA, has introduced the Mental and Physical Health Care Comorbidities Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing collaborative treatment approaches within the Medicare program for individuals facing both mental and physical health challenges. The legislation seeks to establish a demonstration program that encourages hospitals to innovate treatment strategies for patients with coexisting health conditions.

The bill was prompted by the alarming prevalence of comorbid mental and physical health issues, particularly in vulnerable communities where access to integrated care remains limited. Rep. Boyle emphasized the necessity for collaborative treatment models that not only address the symptoms of these conditions but also tackle underlying social determinants of health that exacerbate patient outcomes.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. W. Gregory Steube, R-FL, has introduced the Iranian Terror Prevention Act, aimed at designating a series of militant organizations as foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and imposing sanctions to counteract their operations. This legislation responds to growing concerns over Iranian-supported groups and their activities that threaten U.S. interests and allies.

This bill, introduced on April 1, 2025, seeks to classify 30 organizations linked to Iran, including the Abu Fadl al-Abbas Brigades and the Houthis, as official terrorist entities. The bill mandates the Secretary of State to implement these designations within 90 days of enactment and instructs the President to decide on additional sanctions within 60 days. The urgency of this legislation stems from an increasing number of incidents linked to these groups, which have been implicated in regional destabilization, violence, and acts against U.S. personnel and allies.

The potential impact of the Iranian Terror Prevention Act is significant; by classifying these organizations as terrorists, it aims to disrupt their funding and operational capabilities, thereby enhancing national security. Such action aligns with previous efforts to limit the influence of Iran in Middle Eastern conflicts and may provide a framework for international cooperation against terrorism.

The law will also require ongoing assessments and reports, encouraging vigilance in monitoring and responding to any new threats that may arise from these or related organizations. By addressing this issue proactively, the bill seeks to fortify U.S. foreign policy and security measures, emphasizing a strong stance against terrorism linked to Iranian interests.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2550",40434,"Rep. Golden Introduces Protect America's Workforce Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Jared Golden, D-ME, has introduced the Protect America's Workforce Act, a legislative measure aimed at nullifying a recent executive order that excluded certain federal labor-management relations programs. The bill seeks to reinforce the rights of federal employees and maintain existing collective bargaining agreements amid ongoing concerns regarding labor rights.

The Protect America's Workforce Act comes in response to the executive order issued on March 27, 2025, which has raised significant alarm among labor advocates. Critics argue that the order undermines established protections for public sector workers, potentially affecting their ability to negotiate fair wages and working conditions. By nullifying this order, the proposed legislation reaffirms the government's commitment to upholding labor rights within the federal workforce.

In a climate where labor relations have become increasingly contentious, Golden's initiative is seen as a necessary safeguard for employee rights. The act aims to ensure that all active collective bargaining agreements are maintained and honored, which would prevent disruptions in the negotiations between federal agencies and labor organizations that represent federal employees.

The introduction of this bill marks an important step in addressing the balance of power between federal management and labor unions.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2577",40434,"Rep. Rutherford Introduces PLAN for School Safety Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. John H. Rutherford, R-FL, has introduced the Preparing Leaders to Assess Needs for School Safety Act of 2025 (PLAN for School Safety Act), aimed at enhancing school safety across the nation. The bill proposes the establishment of Regional School Safety Development Centers, which will offer tailored consulting services to educational institutions seeking to develop or refine their safety plans based on evidence-based best practices.

The motivation behind the PLAN for School Safety Act arises from increasing concerns over school safety and the need for comprehensive strategies to protect students and staff. Recent incidents of violence in educational settings have prompted lawmakers to seek effective solutions that not only address immediate security needs but also foster mental health and well-being among students.

The bill empowers schools to create individualized safety plans by providing resources and expertise through the newly proposed centers. This initiative will particularly benefit rural, Tribal, and low-resourced communities that may lack access to adequate safety resources. By promoting collaborative efforts between schools and local entities, the act aims to enhance awareness of effective safety measures and mental health resources.

Funding for the initiative is set at $25 million annually from 2026 through 2030, which will help establish, maintain, and improve the centers. These centers will assist schools in developing tailored safety plans, conducting consultations, and implementing recommended policies, ensuring that each school's unique environment and student needs are prioritized.

The introduction of this legislation marks a significant step toward a more comprehensive approach to school safety. By building a foundation that integrates expert advice and community resources, the PLAN for School Safety Act looks to mitigate threats and foster a secure learning atmosphere across the United States.

The bill (H.R. 2577) introduced on 04/01/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Neguse, Joe [D-CO-2]...04/01/2025; Rep. Gonzales, Tony [R-TX-23]...04/01/2025; Rep. Correa, J. Luis [D-CA-46]...04/01/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2578",40434,"Rep. Sherrill Introduces Drug Testing for Special Government Employees Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-NJ, has introduced the Drug Testing for Special Government Employees Act, aimed at instituting comprehensive drug testing protocols for special government employees in sensitive positions. The proposed legislation mandates drug tests prior to appointment and initiating random drug testing programs within federal agencies.

This bill emerges in the context of growing concerns surrounding workplace safety and national security. Special government employees often occupy critical roles that grant them access to sensitive information, thereby necessitating rigorous oversight to ensure public trust. The bill stipulates that all prospective candidates must pass a drug test before commencing their service, reflecting a proactive approach to safeguarding the integrity of government operations.

If enacted, the legislation would require agencies to implement random drug testing for current employees in sensitive positions within 90 days of the bill's passage. This provision aims to deter potential substance abuse and affirm the government's commitment to maintaining a drug-free work environment. Notably, individuals testing positive would face significant consequences, including a one-year ban from reappointment for prospective employees and mandatory removal from civil service for current employees.

The introduction of this bill aligns with broader federal workplace drug testing initiatives, reinforcing a standard of accountability among special government employees. Agencies involved, including the Executive Office of the President and the Office of Management and Budget, will be accountable for adhering to these guidelines. 

As the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reviews the proposal, it highlights the increasing priority placed on workplace safety and security in federal employment practices, raising expectations for rigorous compliance with drug-free standards in sensitive governmental roles.

The bill (H.R. 2578) was introduced on 04/01/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-PA, has introduced the Reduce Duplication and Improve Access to Work Act, aimed at enhancing workforce development through a new funding mechanism. This legislation seeks to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to allow states to transfer a limited amount of funds from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) program.

The bill is a response to ongoing concerns about the inefficiencies surrounding federal funding for workforce development. By allowing states to allocate resources more flexibly, this legislation intends to reduce redundancy and streamline efforts to prepare individuals for employment. Currently, states often face barriers in utilizing TANF funds effectively for workforce training, leading to a misallocation of resources that could otherwise support job seekers.

If passed, the bill could significantly impact local workforce programs, enabling states to pursue holistic approaches to employment assistance. The legislation would permit states to reserve up to 15% of the transferred TANF funds for statewide workforce investment activities. Additionally, states intending to make these transfers must submit a combined state plan to the Secretaries of the respective departments, ensuring a structured approach to fund allocation.

This initiative aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress regarding the importance of coherent workforce development strategies. It aims to empower state governments with the necessary resources to adapt to evolving job markets while supporting low-income individuals seeking better employment opportunities. As the bill moves forward to the Committee on Ways and Means, proponents and critics alike will provide insights into its potential ramifications on federal and state budgetary processes.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Darren Soto, D-FL, has introduced the Kissimmee River Wild and Scenic River Act, aimed at designating a segment of the Kissimmee River in Florida as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This legislative move is part of a broader effort to enhance conservation measures and highlight the ecological significance of the region.

The bill proposes the protection of a restored segment of the Kissimmee River, stretching approximately 16 miles downstream of Lake Kissimmee to 15 miles upstream of Lake Okeechobee. This designation not only highlights the river's natural beauty but is anticipated to promote recreational opportunities while ensuring long-term environmental preservation. The bill underscores the importance of safeguarding such water bodies that play a vital role in local ecosystems and communities.

The Kissimmee River has been a focal point for environmental concerns due to previous ecological degradation. By establishing this protection, the federal government aims to facilitate restoration efforts that enhance water quality and habitat for wildlife. This designation could serve as a model for other regions facing similar environmental challenges, showcasing how legislative frameworks can support ecological restoration initiatives.

The broader context of this bill reflects an increasing commitment towards environmental protection and sustainable development practices, especially in aquatic environments. As climate change continues to pose threats to natural habitats, measures such as the Kissimmee River designation may play pivotal roles in combating these challenges.

Soto's proposal has garnered attention not only for its ecological implications but also for its potential to drive eco-tourism in Florida. The River’s designation is expected to attract a growing number of visitors, contributing to local economies while promoting an appreciation for nature and conservation efforts. As the bill progresses through the House, stakeholders await its potential impact on both environmental protection and community development.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2575",40434,"Rep. Pfluger Introduces Rescission Bill on Iran Waivers","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at rescinding specific waivers and licenses related to Iran. This bill is designed to restrict access to funds that have been previously allowed under certain provisions of U.S. law, specifically addressing transactions involving the Government of Iran.

The initiative comes in the wake of heightened concerns regarding Iran's financial activities and its implications on international security. By eliminating these waivers and licenses, the bill intends to tighten restrictions on Iranian financial capabilities, particularly those related to funds transferred from international allies like South Korea to Qatar. Supporters of the bill argue that such measures are essential for ensuring that U.S. resources do not inadvertently aid Iran's controversial activities.

In addition to halting current waivers, the legislation prohibits the President from reissuing similar licenses in the future. This reflects a broader shift in U.S. policy towards Iran, emphasizing strict enforcement of sanctions designed to counteract its influence in the region. The potential impact of this measure could be substantial, as it may significantly limit Iran's financial operations and restrict its access to international banking systems.

The bill has been forwarded to the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Oversight and Government Reform, where its provisions will be reviewed for compliance with broader legislative objectives. By pursuing this course of action, Rep. Pfluger aims to reaffirm congressional support for rigorous measures against Iran, aligning with a growing sentiment among lawmakers favoring a more hardline approach.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Haley Stevens, D-MI, has introduced the Expanding Partnerships for Innovation and Competitiveness Act, a new piece of legislation aimed at establishing the Foundation for Standards and Metrology. This foundation will facilitate collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), higher education institutions, and various industries to advance measurement science and technical standards in the United States.

The bill was prompted by a growing need for improved technical standards as the rapid pace of technological innovation outpaces current benchmarks. By establishing a nonprofit corporation, the legislation seeks to enhance economic security and technological competitiveness. It emphasizes support for emerging technologies and aims to foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including researchers, academic institutions, and the private sector.

Through this initiative, the Foundation will facilitate projects and studies on metrology, engage in education and outreach, and support NIST associates with funding for fellowships and training. Such endeavors are expected to result in a stronger framework for the commercialization of federally funded research, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.

The foundation is designed to be independent of federal agencies, allowing for greater flexibility in fundraising and program development. It will also require the establishment of a Board of Directors composed of various stakeholders to oversee its operations and ensure alignment with NIST's mission.

This bill highlights a proactive approach to address the challenges posed by a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Protect TANF Resources for Families Act aimed at ensuring that federal funds allocated for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program are used effectively. The bill seeks to amend part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act, clarifying that federal money must be applied to supplement state spending, rather than replace it.

The necessity of this bill stems from concerns that some states may use federal TANF funds to offset their own budgetary commitments, undermining the intent of providing direct financial support to families in need. By creating a framework that mandates state certification on the non-supplanting of funds, the act aims to better protect the integrity of TANF resources and ensure that the financial assistance translates into real benefits for struggling families.

If enacted, the Protect TANF Resources for Families Act could significantly bolster state compliance with federal funding guidelines, potentially improving the assistance available to those living in poverty. This initiative comes at a time when many families are facing economic hardships, emphasizing the critical role of TANF in providing a safety net.

Additionally, the act proposes a two-year reauthorization of TANF programs, extending through September 30, 2026, to ensure continuity for services and activities aimed at maintaining the welfare of families. The implications of this legislation are substantial, as it seeks not just to maintain but to enhance the financial stability of households that depend on TANF.

H.R. 2584 has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, showcasing Rep. Tenney’s commitment to advocating for the welfare of families in her district and across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Dina Titus, D-NV, has introduced the Armenian Genocide Education Act, aimed at enhancing educational programs about the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. The bill directs the Librarian of Congress to create resources that will support understanding and awareness of this critical historical event.

The introduction of this bill is significant, responding to ongoing discussions about the recognition of genocides and the importance of historical education in combating denial and distortion of facts. The Armenian Genocide has often been overshadowed in history classes, leading to misconceptions and a lack of awareness among younger generations. By mandating the development of educational materials and professional training for educators, the act seeks to promote a deeper understanding of the genocide's implications and relevance to modern societal issues, including hate and bigotry.

The potential impact of this legislation extends beyond mere education; it aims to foster empathy and awareness, encouraging students to draw parallels to contemporary issues and prevent similar atrocities in the future. The Librarian of Congress would facilitate the creation and dissemination of educational resources, including digital materials and teacher workshops.

Historically, the United States has made commitments to recognizing the Armenian Genocide, including recent statements from Congress and the President. The act builds on this legacy, emphasizing the need to teach the lessons of the Armenian Genocide in a comprehensive manner. It addresses the critical need for balanced curricula that accurately represent the systematic campaign against Armenians and other Christians during the late Ottoman Empire.

With growing public interest in understanding historical injustices, the Armenian Genocide Education Act highlights the necessity of informed discourse and the preservation of history as a learning tool for future generations.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2586",40434,"Rep. Tonko Introduces Reentry Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY, has introduced the Reentry Act of 2025, aimed at improving healthcare access for individuals transitioning from correctional facilities. The bill proposes amending the Social Security Act to enable states to provide medical assistance to inmates during the 30-day period leading up to their release.

This legislation addresses a critical gap in healthcare for incarcerated individuals, who often face significant health challenges upon reintegration into society. By allowing for Medicaid coverage prior to release, the bill seeks to improve continuity of care and support better health outcomes for formerly incarcerated individuals as they return to their communities. 

The introduction of this bill comes amidst growing recognition of the need for comprehensive healthcare for this vulnerable population. Current regulations prevent federal funding for Medicaid services for incarcerated individuals, a policy that many advocates argue exacerbates recidivism rates and undermines public health. If passed, the Reentry Act will enable inmates to access necessary medical and behavioral health services, thereby facilitating a smoother transition back into society and reducing the burden on emergency healthcare systems.

An essential component of the Reentry Act is its requirement for the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to produce a report after 18 months of enactment. This report will analyze the health care standards in correctional facilities and assess the impacts of allowing medical assistance to inmates prior to their release, offering further insight into necessary improvements within the legislative framework.

The bill has garnered bipartisan support, reflecting a collective understanding of the importance of healthcare in reducing recidivism and enhancing community wellbeing.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-NJ, has introduced the Youth Mental Health Research Act, aiming to establish a collaborative research initiative under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) focused on improving mental health outcomes for young people. The bill encourages interdisciplinary research to build resilience and enhance mental health interventions tailored to youth.

The Youth Mental Health Research Act responds to the alarming rise in mental health issues among adolescents, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Donald S. Beyer, D-VA, has introduced the Improving Reporting to Prevent Hate Act, aimed at enhancing the accountability of local jurisdictions in reporting hate crimes. The legislation seeks to ensure that communities with populations over 100,000 engage in credible reporting practices, thereby strengthening efforts to combat hate crimes across the country.

The impetus for this bill arises from a rising awareness of hate crimes and their profound impact on communities. The proposed act amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 by mandating an evaluation process conducted by the Attorney General. This evaluation will determine if jurisdictions are credibly reporting hate crimes to the FBI, addressing a critical gap in the current reporting framework.

If a jurisdiction fails to report hate crimes accurately, it would lose eligibility for federal allocations under the grant program unless it can demonstrate that it has engaged in significant community education initiatives related to hate crime awareness. This provision aims to encourage local governments to proactively address issues surrounding hate crimes.

The act also requires the Attorney General to publish an annual report online detailing jurisdictions that meet educational mandates, fostering transparency and accountability. It reflects a growing recognition of the need for systematic data gathering and reporting to inform policies and programs aimed at eradicating hate-based violence.

With this bill, Rep. Beyer aims not only to improve the statistics surrounding hate crimes but also to promote community engagement and awareness initiatives that can help in prevention. As hate crimes continue to challenge societal cohesion, the Improving Reporting to Prevent Hate Act represents a significant step toward fostering safer communities.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX, has introduced the LIZARD Act of 2025, a piece of legislation aimed at removing the dunes sagebrush lizard from the threatened and endangered species lists under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This initiative seeks to revise protections for the species, asserting that such actions will enhance resource development in Texas.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing debates regarding the balance between environmental conservation and economic growth. Proponents of the LIZARD Act argue that the restrictions placing the dunes sagebrush lizard on these lists hinder energy development and land use, particularly in oil-rich areas of Texas where the lizard is predominantly found. By delisting the species, supporters believe that the bill will facilitate job creation and development opportunities in the region.

Critics of the bill contend that removing protections for the dunes sagebrush lizard may jeopardize biodiversity and disrupt the local ecosystem. Conservationists express concerns that the lizard's habitat could face significant threats without the safeguards provided by its current status. They emphasize the importance of maintaining biodiversity, particularly in fragile ecosystems, as a vital part of environmental health.

Furthermore, the LIZARD Act proposes an amendment to the Endangered Species Act to explicitly exclude the dunes sagebrush lizard from being classified as a threatened or endangered species. This change could set a precedent affecting other species and encourage similar legislative actions, potentially reshaping environmental policy.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, where it will likely undergo discussions and revisions before being brought to the House floor for a vote. Its passage would mark a significant shift in conservation approach while reflecting the ongoing tension between ecological preservation and economic interests.

The bill (H.R. 2573) was introduced on 04/01/2025.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2572",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces Worker Enfranchisement Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced the Worker Enfranchisement Act to amend the National Labor Relations Act, aiming to enhance employee participation in union representation elections through secret ballots. The proposed legislation mandates that exclusive representatives of employees must be designated through a majority vote in secret ballot elections, with at least two-thirds of eligible employees participating.

This legislation responds to increasing concerns over the transparency and fairness of union elections. Advocates argue that existing processes can be influenced by external pressures and a lack of confidential voting. By instituting mandatory secret ballots, the bill seeks to empower workers and ensure that their voices are heard without fear of intimidation or coercion. 

The potential impact of the Worker Enfranchisement Act extends beyond just voting mechanics; it reflects a broader movement towards labor reform in the U.S. Proponents believe that increasing worker agency in union elections could lead to more robust union participation and, ultimately, better working conditions. This bill could set a precedent for future labor policies aimed at advancing workers' rights.

The introduction of this act comes at a time of heightened labor activity across the nation, with many workers advocating for better representation and working conditions. Supporters of the bill highlight its relevance in ensuring that labor unions truly reflect the will of their members, especially in an era where economic disparities are more pronounced.

Currently, the Worker Enfranchisement Act has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for review. As discussions evolve, the bill may stimulate significant debates surrounding labor rights and the future of organized labor in America.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2571",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces Self-Insurance Protection Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced the Self-Insurance Protection Act aimed at amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The legislation seeks to exclude certain medical stop-loss insurance from the definition of health insurance coverage for employers who self-fund their health plans. This aims to bolster financial protections for businesses managing unexpected healthcare costs.

The Self-Insurance Protection Act responds to growing concerns from both small and large employers who opt for self-funded health insurance arrangements. Typically, these employers purchase stop-loss insurance as a mechanism to limit their potential losses from unexpected health claims. By clarifying that such stop-loss policies are not classified as traditional health insurance, the new measure may facilitate more favorable regulatory conditions for businesses. 

This legislative proposal is essential given the rising healthcare costs that pose significant risks to company assets. Employers who self-fund their health benefit plans often require added security against high-cost claims that could otherwise jeopardize their financial stability. Currently, while ERISA regulates employer-sponsored health plans, the states determine the availability and terms surrounding stop-loss insurance, leading to inconsistencies and potentially limited access for employers. 

By ensuring that stop-loss policies are recognized distinctly from standard health insurance, the bill potentially allows employers to better manage their health insurance expenses and risks. Additionally, this legislative change highlights a broader acknowledgment of the evolving nature of workplace health benefits and the necessity for a supportive regulatory framework that encourages self-funding approaches. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, introduced the Train Noise and Vibrations Reduction Act of 2025, aimed at addressing the impact of train noise and vibrations on residential areas. The bill requires the Comptroller General of the United States to compile and submit a report to Congress within one year, offering recommendations to mitigate these disturbances.

The introduction of this bill follows growing complaints from constituents living near train tracks who report disruptions to their daily lives due to excessive noise and vibrations from passing trains. Numerous studies indicate that prolonged exposure to such conditions can lead to stress-related health issues, prompting local leaders to advocate for regulatory measures. The proposed act not only seeks to alleviate these disturbances but also aims to improve the quality of life for residents who have long suffered from the disruptions of railway operations.

Under the provisions of the bill, the Comptroller General will be tasked with evaluating various strategies to reduce train noise and vibrations. Recommendations may include technical modifications to trains and tracks, adjustments in train speed limits, and implementing operational limits on the number of trains and cars during specified hours. The report will also estimate the costs and benefits of each recommendation, which will aid Congress in understanding potential investments needed for these improvements.

The introduction of this measure highlights a growing acknowledgment of the pressures urban populations face from aging infrastructure and the need for modernization. With multiple stakeholders, including community organizations and rail industry representatives, likely to weigh in, the bill represents a significant step toward creating a more livable environment for those affected by rail operations.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Kevin Mullin, D-CA, has introduced the Earthquake Resilience Act, aiming to enhance national preparedness and resilience against future seismic events. The bill mandates a comprehensive risk assessment that seeks to gauge the effectiveness of community efforts in fortifying earthquake resilience while identifying any existing vulnerabilities.

This legislation comes in response to increasing seismic activity and the need for public safety enhancements. An alarming number of recent earthquakes have underscored the urgency of addressing infrastructure weaknesses and emergency response capabilities. By mandating a national risk assessment led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the bill seeks to promote a coordinated approach in collaboration with federal, state, and local authorities.

The proposed assessment will evaluate the progress made by communities in strengthening their earthquake defenses. It also aims to highlight gaps in current resilience strategies—which could include inadequacies in building codes and preparedness training—that may still place residents at risk during seismic events. 

Moreover, the Earthquake Resilience Act proposes updates to the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, focusing on the establishment of improved recovery standards for critical infrastructure following an earthquake. This emphasis on post-disaster recovery underscores the necessity of maintaining essential services and rapid response capabilities during emergencies.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Gwen Moore, D-WI, has introduced a significant bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code concerning financial guaranty insurance companies. This legislation seeks to clarify and establish special rules for these companies to qualify as qualifying insurance corporations under the passive foreign investment company rules.

The introduction of this bill, which comes in the wake of increasing scrutiny regarding financial practices, aims to provide favorable tax treatment for financial guaranty insurance companies. By delineating specific criteria, the bill intends to ensure that these companies retain their operational flexibility while maintaining compliance with tax regulations. Notably, it suggests that companies adhering to certain financial exposure ratios will be treated differently under tax code provisions, potentially offering them more leniency in how they report reserves.

This measure is particularly relevant given the challenges faced by financial guaranty insurers in recent years, including market fluctuations and changes in accounting standards. Providing these companies with clearer guidelines may enhance their stability, which is crucial for underwriting municipal bonds, a significant market in which they operate.

Financial guaranty insurance plays a pivotal role in the municipal bond market, offering protection to investors against default on bond payments. The outlined bill recognizes the essential role these companies perform in ensuring confidence in public finance. As the legislative process unfolds, stakeholders in the insurance and financial sectors are expected to keep a close eye on this bill, which could reshape the tax landscape for financial guaranty insurers moving forward.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, reflecting its importance within tax reform discussions.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Tom McClintock, R-CA, has introduced a new bill aimed at repealing the federal clean vehicle credit for electric vehicles. The legislation, titled the “End Taxpayer Subsidies for Electric Vehicles Act,” proposes to eliminate taxpayer-funded incentives that have historically aimed to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) across the nation.

This legislative effort comes amid growing concerns about the efficiency and equity of government subsidies. Proponents of the bill, including McClintock, argue that the current subsidy structure disproportionately benefits wealthier consumers who can afford to purchase electric vehicles. By abolishing these incentives, they suggest that it will help level the playing field for all vehicle purchases, regardless of the buyer's financial status.

The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code by striking down Section 30D, which pertains to the clean vehicle credit. This elimination would mark a significant shift in federal policy regarding electric vehicles, particularly as the market for EVs continues to expand. Critics of the bill contend that removing subsidies could stifle innovation and progress toward greener transportation solutions at a crucial time when climate issues are becoming increasingly pressing.

Even as the potential impacts of this legislation unfold, the automotive industry and environmental activists are closely monitoring its progress. With electric vehicle sales gaining momentum, the outcome of this bill could have profound implications for the future of clean energy transportation in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Brian J. Mast, R-FL, has introduced the No Tax on Bonuses Act, aimed at alleviating financial burdens on service members by amending the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain military bonuses from gross income. This legislation specifically targets enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for members of the armed forces, ensuring these financial incentives do not impact tax liabilities.

The introduction of this bill comes as part of ongoing efforts to support military personnel, especially considering the current economic climate. Service members often face unique financial challenges, and this bill seeks to provide them with additional support by reducing the tax implications associated with joining or rejoining the military. By excluding such bonuses from gross income, the legislation aims to encourage enlistment and retention within the armed forces.

If passed, the No Tax on Bonuses Act could have significant implications for the military recruitment landscape. Recruiters may find an enhanced ability to attract new service members and retain current ones, ultimately benefiting military readiness. As workforce shortages in various sectors continue to challenge the economy, ensuring that military service remains an attractive employment option is increasingly important.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. Additional discussions will likely focus on the fiscal impacts and logistics of implementing this exclusion in the tax system. Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, has introduced the Protect Victims of Digital Exploitation and Manipulation Act, aiming to prohibit the distribution and production of digital forgeries of intimate visual depictions without consent. This legislative measure seeks to enhance the protection of individuals from harmful digital content that manipulates their likeness, especially in an era of advanced technology where deepfakes and similar forgeries are increasingly prevalent.

The bill arises from growing concerns regarding the misuse of technology to create misleading and damaging representations of individuals, particularly in non-consensual pornography scenarios. Digital forgeries can have devastating effects on victims, including emotional trauma, reputational damage, and severe implications for personal safety. As technology becomes more accessible and potent, the need for reinforced legal frameworks to tackle such exploitation has become critical.

This legislation proposes significant penalties for anyone found guilty of creating or distributing these forgeries, imposing fines or imprisonment for up to five years. It explicitly defines what constitutes a digital forgery, setting clear parameters around intimate visual depictions and the conditions under which consent must be given. The bill includes exceptions for law enforcement, legal proceedings, and medical contexts, ensuring responsible usage of such digital content for legitimate purposes.

By addressing these issues, the Protect Victims of Digital Exploitation and Manipulation Act represents a proactive step toward safeguarding individual privacy and dignity in the face of evolving digital threats. As lawmakers grapple with the implications of technological advancements, this bill highlights the urgency of adapting legal frameworks to protect citizens from digital harm effectively.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Water Accessibility Act aimed at improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities in underserved communities across the United States. The legislation seeks to allocate federal funds to support infrastructure projects that will ensure clean water availability and promote hygiene practices essential for public health.

The Clean Water Accessibility Act responds to increasing concerns over water quality in many areas, especially in rural and low-income urban regions where existing infrastructure is outdated or insufficient. By funneling resources into local projects, the bill aims to rectify disparities in water access that have persisted for decades. As a growing number of studies highlight the link between clean water access and health outcomes, the necessity for this legislation has become ever more apparent.

If passed, the bill could significantly alter the landscape for many communities, potentially impacting millions who currently lack reliable access to potable water. The proposed funding would prioritize projects that deal with lead pipe replacement, water filtration installation, and the establishment of community-based sanitation systems. Additionally, it would incentivize collaboration between state and local governments to create sustainable water solutions tailored to specific needs.

Historically, the U.S. has made strides in improving water quality, yet it continues to grapple with contamination issues, particularly in marginalized areas. The introduction of the Clean Water Accessibility Act represents a renewed commitment to equitable access to basic necessities. As stakeholders in public health, environmental protection, and community development rally around this initiative, the focus now shifts to garnering bipartisan support necessary for the bill's advancement in Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Michael Lawler, R-NY, has introduced the “One Vote One Choice Act,” a bill aimed at amending the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit states from implementing ranked choice voting in federal elections. The legislation, unveiled on April 1, 2025, targets the growing trend of ranked choice voting systems, which allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference.

The main thrust of the One Vote One Choice Act is to standardize voting procedures across all states for federal office elections by eliminating ranked choice voting as an option. Lawler's motivation for this bill stems from concerns that ranked choice voting could lead to voter confusion and diminish the clarity of election outcomes. By establishing a single voting method, proponents believe it will enhance the overall integrity and simplicity of the electoral process.

This legislation could potentially reshape how federal elections are conducted, affecting numerous states that have recently adopted ranked choice voting systems. Advocates of the bill assert that it will restore confidence in elections by ensuring that voters have a straightforward and uniform experience when casting their ballots. Critics, however, argue that ranked choice voting encourages greater voter engagement and helps third-party candidates gain traction, thereby broadening the political landscape.

The One Vote One Choice Act currently awaits review by the House Committee on House Administration, where it will be debated alongside the implications of such a legislative change. As ranked choice voting continues to gain traction in various jurisdictions, the outcome of this bill may have far-reaching consequences for future electoral practices at the federal level.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Nicholas A. Langworthy, R-NY, has introduced the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act, aimed at ensuring continued federal support for respite care programs that assist family caregivers across the United States. This legislation is intended to reauthorize critical financial resources for these programs through 2029, recognizing the essential services they provide to families in need.

The need for respite care has become increasingly evident as millions of Americans take on caregiving roles for aging relatives or individuals with disabilities. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally taxing, often leading to burnout among caregivers. The Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act seeks to alleviate these challenges by extending funding for respite services, underscoring the importance of caregiver support programs established under the Public Health Service Act.

This legislation comes at a time when the caregiving population is expanding, with an increasing number of individuals stepping up to care for loved ones. Family caregivers often juggle employment and personal responsibilities alongside their caregiving duties, making the availability of respite care a crucial lifeline. By securing resources for these services, the Act aims to improve the quality of life for both caregivers and those receiving care.

Incorporating feedback from stakeholders, the bill also revises the definition of “family caregiver,” expanding it to include a broader range of unpaid individuals. Additionally, the bill aligns funding years with current services, transitioning it from the previous set years between 2020 and 2024 to a new framework spanning 2025 to 2029.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and is expected to gain attention as lawmakers recognize the mounting pressures faced by American caregivers.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-IL, has introduced the Taiwan Allies Fund Act, aimed at supporting Taiwan's international presence amid increasing pressure from the People's Republic of China. This bill seeks to allocate significant financial resources to bolster Taiwan’s diplomatic initiatives and counteract China's efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally.

The introduction of the Taiwan Allies Fund Act comes in response to China's aggressive diplomatic tactics, which have successfully swayed several countries to sever official ties with Taiwan since 2013. The bill proposes an annual appropriation of $40 million for three fiscal years to assist Taiwan in fortifying its diplomatic relationships and enhancing its unofficial international partnerships. This funding is specifically earmarked for countries that maintain official relations with Taiwan or have developed stronger unofficial connections, particularly those under pressure from China.

The legislation also recognizes Taiwan's critical role as a democratic ally and contributor to global peace and stability. By supporting activities such as health initiatives, civil society resilience, and diversifying supply chains away from Chinese dependence, the bill aims to promote Taiwan's economic development and meaningful participation in international organizations.

Furthermore, the Taiwan Allies Fund Act reflects the United States' commitment to uphold its foreign policy that encourages stronger ties with democratic partners like Taiwan. The legislation is part of a broader strategy to counteract China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region and support countries that resist coercive diplomatic pressures.

This bill has garnered significant bipartisan support as lawmakers acknowledge the strategic importance of Taiwan within U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding countering China's assertive foreign policy moves. It has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-SD, has introduced the SAFETY Act of 2025, a legislative measure aimed at amending the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to safeguard foreign markets for U.S. agricultural goods that utilize common names. This bill underscores the importance of maintaining the ability of American producers to market their products globally without facing restrictions on the use of traditional naming conventions.

The introduction of the SAFETY Act comes amid growing concerns among U.S. farmers and exporters regarding international regulatory hurdles that threaten their market presence abroad. As foreign regulations increasingly dictate terminology that can be used for food and agricultural products, many believe that without this protective measure, American producers may lose valuable market shares in key global regions. This bill is designed to ensure that American food products can continue being marketed under widely recognized common names.

The potential impact of the SAFETY Act is significant; it aims to facilitate the use of familiar and established product names in international markets, thereby enhancing competitiveness. By drawing on the expertise of the Secretary of Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative, the legislation seeks to foster negotiations that defend the use of these common names, creating formal agreements that would secure American agricultural interests in foreign countries.

In addition to protecting names, the bill mandates semi-annual briefings to Congress from officials involved in these negotiations, ensuring ongoing oversight and transparency. As global markets evolve, preserving the integrity of the U.S. agricultural sector remains critical, making the SAFETY Act a timely and crucial initiative for American farmers and exporters looking to thrive in an increasingly complex international landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-CA, has introduced the IVF for Military Families Act aimed at expanding access to fertility treatments for active-duty service members and their dependents under the TRICARE Program. This legislation seeks to alleviate the financial burden faced by military families seeking in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility services.

The introduction of this bill comes as an acknowledgment of the unique challenges that military families encounter regarding fertility issues. Studies indicate that service members often face higher rates of infertility, partly due to deployment-related stress and medical conditions sustained during service. By ensuring that fertility treatments are covered, the bill stands to provide relief to many families struggling to conceive.

Under the proposed legislation, TRICARE would cover various fertility-related services, including IVF, oocyte retrievals, embryo transfers, and fertility medications. The bill specifies a cap of three completed oocyte retrievals, but provides for unlimited embryo transfers, aligning with best practices recommended by medical authorities. Furthermore, it aims to establish a program dedicated to the coordination of fertility-related care to ensure that military families receive timely and effective treatment.

The IVF for Military Families Act addresses a growing concern in the military community, as fertility issues become more widespread among service members. By supporting this initiative, lawmakers hope to foster a healthier environment for military families, easing their journey towards starting or expanding their families.

Rep. Jacobs emphasized that every service member deserves the opportunity to build their family without prohibitive costs or logistical hurdles. The bill is currently scheduled for consideration by the House Committee on Armed Services, where it will be scrutinized before potentially advancing to the full House for a vote.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-TX, has introduced the Comprehensive Offshore Resource Enhancement Act of 2025, aimed at bolstering national security and energy independence. The bill focuses on conducting thorough assessments of offshore energy resources and establishing standardized methodologies for resource exploration.

The CORE Act responds to increasing concerns over energy security and the need for more domestic production capabilities. With global energy markets fluctuating, ensuring that the United States fully understands its offshore energy potential is crucial. This bill mandates an extensive inventory and analysis of the country’s offshore resources, including hydrocarbons and critical minerals, to inform future energy strategies.

A significant aspect of the legislation is its emphasis on collaboration with various federal agencies to leverage advanced technologies. This includes the use of geophysical data and artificial intelligence to improve resource estimation accuracy. The bill also proposes regular reviews of offshore exploration methods to keep pace with technological advancements and best practices observed in other countries.

Moreover, the CORE Act addresses environmental considerations and geopolitical implications related to transboundary resources, especially in light of relationships with neighboring countries such as Canada and Mexico. It requires the identification of potential legal frameworks to facilitate cooperative exploration, thereby possibly enhancing diplomatic relations while ensuring energy security.

The bill highlights the importance of the U.S. maintaining competitiveness in global energy markets, stressing benefits such as job creation within the energy sector and increased revenue for states dependent on offshore drilling. As it heads to the House Natural Resources Committee, the CORE Act is anticipated to stimulate conversations on the future of energy policy in the U.S.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced legislation aimed at amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to enhance protections for student organizations, particularly single-sex groups. Titled the Freedom of Association in Higher Education Act of 2025, the bill seeks to prevent institutions of higher education from discriminating against students based on their affiliation with single-sex social organizations.

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing concerns about the treatment of single-sex organizations on college campuses, where members have reported facing adverse actions based on their membership. Rep. Houchin advocates for the rights of students to freely associate and participate in organizations reflective of their interests without fear of retaliation or discrimination. 

The proposed legislation stipulates that institutions receiving federal funding cannot penalize students or organizations simply for their single-sex membership status. Under the bill, universities would be barred from imposing any membership restrictions or conditions that do not apply to other student organizations, thereby reinforcing the principle of equal treatment across campus platforms.

Furthermore, the bill includes definitions of adverse actions that could include expulsion, the denial of on-campus housing, and limitations on participation in university-sponsored events. By clearly outlining these protections, Houchin aims to strengthen freedom of association rights while still allowing institutions to maintain their own membership criteria based on valid academic or safety concerns.

This legislative effort emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and respect for individual choices on campuses, potentially impacting the landscape of higher education and its approach to student organizations in the years to come. As the bill moves to the Education and Workforce Committee, further discussions and potential amendments are anticipated, reflecting diverse viewpoints in the ongoing debate surrounding campus freedoms.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Steven Horsford, D-NV, has introduced the Lower Drug Costs for Families Act, aimed at reducing the financial burden of prescription medications for families across the nation. This legislation seeks to apply prescription drug inflation rebates to drugs available in the commercial market and adjust the base year used for rebate calculations, potentially lowering prices for consumers.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing concerns about rising prescription drug costs, which have become a significant issue for families struggling to afford necessary medications. By expanding the scope of inflation rebates to cover commercially sold drugs, the legislation seeks to ensure that drug prices remain stable and predictable for consumers. This initiative aligns with a broader effort in Congress to address healthcare affordability and reduce out-of-pocket costs for families, particularly those with chronic health conditions.

If passed, the Lower Drug Costs for Families Act could lead to substantial savings for American households, allowing families to allocate more of their income towards other essential needs such as housing, education, and savings. Moreover, the bill emphasizes the need for transparency in pricing, contributing to a more competitive marketplace.

Horsford’s legislation would modify the Social Security Act to implement these changes, with provisions specifically targeting both Medicare Part B and Part D drugs. The bill highlights a critical shift in policy designed to shift the financial landscape of prescription drug affordability, reflecting ongoing advocacy from constituents concerned about expensive healthcare costs.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, where lawmakers will examine its details and potential implications for the healthcare system. The outcome of this legislation could mark a significant step forward in ensuring fairer drug pricing for all Americans.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Steven Horsford, D-NV, has introduced the Capping Prescription Costs Act aimed at limiting out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs for individuals and families enrolled in qualified health plans. The proposed legislation sets a maximum annual cost-sharing limit of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, effective from 2026, with adjustments for inflation in future years.

The introduction of this bill comes amid rising concerns over the affordability of prescription medications. Many Americans struggle with high costs, leading to difficult choices between necessary treatments and personal finances. The Capping Prescription Costs Act seeks to alleviate these burdens by capping yearly costs, thereby improving access to essential medications for millions of citizens.

Furthermore, the act expands its reach by applying similar cost-sharing limits to group health and insurance plans. This provision is expected to cover a broader demographic, addressing challenges faced by families reliant on employer-sponsored health insurance. Under the new regulations, any group health plan failing to comply would face penalties, enhancing the incentive for insurers to embrace cost control measures.

The bill has gained momentum among congressional representatives, having garnered support from a coalition of lawmakers committed to healthcare reform. If passed, the Capping Prescription Costs Act could significantly impact the healthcare landscape, potentially leading to improved health outcomes as more individuals access the medications they need without incurring crippling financial hardship.

As the bill advances through various committees, stakeholders await its potential incorporation into larger healthcare reform discussions. Rep. Horsford's initiative exemplifies a growing legislative focus on healthcare affordability, marking a critical step toward ensuring that all Americans can obtain necessary medications without undue financial strain.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-IA, has introduced the RIFLE Act, a legislative proposal aimed at eliminating the firearm transfer tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This move is intended to reduce financial barriers for law-abiding citizens who wish to purchase and transfer firearms.

The RIFLE Act, formally titled the Repealing Illegal Freedom and Liberty Excises Act, seeks to repeal what Hinson and her supporters view as a punitive tax on firearm transfers. This legislation is designed to bolster Second Amendment rights by making firearm ownership and transfer more accessible. By removing the tax, proponents argue individuals will have more freedom to exercise their right to bear arms without the burden of additional costs.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing national conversations about gun rights and the legal frameworks regulating firearm ownership. Supporters of the RIFLE Act contend that the tax disproportionately impacts lower-income individuals and families. By removing this tax, the legislation aims to promote responsible gun ownership and ensure that all citizens can access firearms under the constitution's provision.

Additionally, the bill’s sponsors believe that eliminating the tax may encourage legal compliance by reducing the financial motive for potential underground transfers. The legislation has already drawn interest from multiple Republican members of Congress, reflecting a growing push within the party to prioritize gun rights and reform firearm-related taxation.

As the RIFLE Act advances to the House Committee on Ways and Means, lawmakers anticipate discussions concerning its implications for public safety and individual liberties. If passed, the bill could significantly change the landscape of firearm ownership in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-NC, has introduced the Military Installation Retail Security Act to enhance security and oversight of retail operations on U.S. military installations. The bill aims to establish strict requirements concerning long-term concessions agreements between the Secretary of Defense and certain retailers, especially those linked to nations considered security risks.

This legislation comes in response to growing concerns regarding national security and the potential for foreign influence on military sites. By prohibiting contracts with retailers controlled by designated covered nations, the bill seeks to protect the welfare and morale of servicemen and women while minimizing vulnerabilities. The Secretary of Defense would gain authority to conduct thorough investigations into any links between retailers and such nations, thereby ensuring that essential services remain secured for military personnel.

The act introduces specific protocols for contracting, including an annual review of existing agreements. In instances where a retailer misrepresents its ownership or fails to comply with established guidelines, the Secretary is empowered to terminate contracts expeditiously. Furthermore, the bill requires immediate reporting after any waiver authority is exercised, enhancing accountability and transparency in defense operations.

Through its implementation, the Military Installation Retail Security Act aims not only to safeguard military assets but also to reinforce trust among those serving in the Armed Forces. By ensuring that retailers operating on military grounds pose no threat to national security, the legislation strengthens the integrity of military operations across the country. The bill is now under review by the House Armed Services Committee as lawmakers consider the potential impact this will have on military installations and their surrounding communities.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-ME, has introduced the Servicemembers and Veterans Empowerment and Support Act, a sweeping piece of legislation aimed at enhancing healthcare and benefits for veterans and servicemembers affected by military sexual trauma (MST). The bill seeks to amend various provisions of Title 38 of the United States Code, ultimately expanding access to vital services and ensuring better support for those impacted by MST during military service.

The legislation comes in response to the alarming rates of sexual trauma reported within the military, which have prompted calls for reform in the way the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) handles claims and provides care. The bill proposes updates to the definitions of military sexual trauma, thereby addressing gaps in coverage related to online and technological communications. It also aims to simplify and enhance the claims process for veterans experiencing MST-related conditions, facilitating easier access to compensation and healthcare.

Significantly, the act includes provisions for establishing specialized teams to evaluate claims related to military sexual trauma, ensuring that veterans receive the attention and consideration their cases warrant. Additionally, it expands eligibility for counseling and treatment services to all former members of the reserve components of the armed forces. 

The impact of this legislation could be far-reaching, potentially improving the lives of countless veterans who have previously struggled with inadequate support and recognition of their experiences. With several organizations advocating for stronger protections and services, the Servicemembers and Veterans Empowerment and Support Act represents a critical step towards addressing the urgent needs of these servicemembers and upholding the commitment to their well-being.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the Fire Island AIDS Memorial Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at commemorating the impact of the AIDS epidemic on the Fire Island communities of Pines and Cherry Grove, New York. This bill seeks to authorize the Pines Foundation to establish a memorial that honors the lives lost to the disease while also educating future generations about its historical significance.

The bill was initiated in response to the ongoing conversation about recognizing the histories of communities affected by the AIDS crisis. Proponents argue that a dedicated space for remembrance and education is crucial for acknowledging both the struggles faced by residents and their resilience. The proposed memorial will be situated at the Fire Island National Seashore, specifically between the Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove neighborhoods.

Critical to the bill is the stipulation that federal funds will not be allocated for the Memorial’s design, construction, or maintenance. Instead, the project will rely entirely on non-federal contributions, reinforcing the community's role in shaping this cultural landmark. This funding structure highlights the spirit of local involvement and ownership in preserving community history.

Garbarino’s legislation is not just about erecting a physical structure; it represents a broader commitment to remembering those lost and educating visitors about the AIDS epidemic’s impact on this island community. With its introduction, advocates hope to create a space that fosters reflection and understanding, ensuring that the narrative of AIDS and its effects will not be forgotten. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Salud O. Carbajal, D-CA, has introduced the Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act aimed at allowing electrical utilities to clear vegetation around electrical lines on federal lands without the need for a timber sale. The legislation seeks to enhance safety in national forests and Bureau of Land Management areas by reducing the risk of wildfires caused by overgrown trees and vegetation near power lines.

The bill is a response to a growing emphasis on fire prevention, particularly in regions prone to wildfires. The recent surge in wildfire incidents in California has prompted lawmakers to take proactive measures in ensuring that electrical infrastructure does not contribute to the increased risk of devastating fires. Under this bill, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior would have the authority to grant permits for vegetation removal, streamlining the process for electrical utilities.

By facilitating the removal of hazardous trees and brush, the legislation aims to protect local communities and environments. It also includes provisions requiring utilities to share proceeds from any sale of removed materials, ensuring that funds are reinvested into maintaining the safety of electrical infrastructure.

H.R. 2492 has been referred to the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees for further consideration. The act represents a crucial step forward in preventing fire hazards linked to electrical lines, reflecting a commitment to both community safety and forest management. The bill's sponsors believe that this approach will not only safeguard residents living near federal lands but also contribute to the overall health of these ecosystems by promoting responsible land management practices.

The bill (H.R. 2492) introduced on 03/31/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Valadao, David G. [R-CA-22]...03/31/2025; Rep. Costa, Jim [D-CA-21]...03/31/2025; Rep. Fitzpatrick, Brian K. [R-PA-1]...03/31/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-NY, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at enhancing counterterrorism and maritime security cooperation among the United States, Israel, Greece, and the Republic of Cyprus. This bill, titled the American-Hellenic-Israeli Eastern Mediterranean Counterterrorism and Maritime Security Partnership Act of 2025, seeks to bolster the existing “3+1” partnership framework while addressing increasing regional security challenges.

The impetus for this legislation comes in light of escalating threats posed by terrorism, particularly following the recent October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, which affected American interests. By strengthening defense protocols and counterterrorism training, the bill promotes collaborative efforts among these strategic allies in the Eastern Mediterranean, ensuring that they are adequately prepared to respond to shared security risks.

The proposed legislation outlines a platform for joint military exercises and intelligence sharing, effectively leveraging the strengths of each nation involved. This collaborative approach is particularly vital as each country has demonstrated commitment and competency in maritime security and counterterrorism initiatives. For instance, Greece has increased its defense spending significantly, while Israel maintains a robust history of cooperative defense agreements with the U.S.

Furthermore, the bill envisions financial allocations for enhancing security infrastructures, including funding for comprehensive training programs aimed at counterterrorism and maritime response. These initiatives emphasize interoperability among forces from all participating countries, further solidifying their united front against regional threats.

The American-Hellenic-Israeli Eastern Mediterranean Counterterrorism and Maritime Security Partnership Act underscores a strategic shift towards a robust collaborative framework, adapting to current geopolitical complexities and reinforcing the long-standing alliances that underpin U.S. foreign policy in the region.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-FL, has introduced a new bill aimed at addressing the nation's affordable housing crisis by mandating the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to submit an annual report to Congress. The report will analyze state and local strategies, activities, and plans that promote affordable housing, with the goal of identifying successful measures that could be supported at the federal level.

With millions of Americans struggling to afford housing, this legislation addresses a growing concern in communities nationwide. The U.S. is currently facing significant shortages in its housing stock, with many individuals and families spending over a third of their income on housing costs. By evaluating existing state initiatives, this bill seeks to gather insights that can inform federal responses to the housing crisis.

The proposal includes the establishment of a clearinghouse that will serve as a repository of state and local laws, regulations, and policies related to affordable housing. This centralized platform aims to assist both local governments and federal agencies in understanding the efficacy of various housing strategies. Through this initiative, Congress can gather valuable data on what works and what doesn’t, enabling more targeted assistance to states grappling with similar challenges.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when housing affordability is a hot-button issue across the political spectrum. Advocates for affordable housing see this legislation as a potential avenue to streamline federal support and encourage effective local solutions. If passed, this initiative could pave the way for more strategic investments aimed at alleviating the housing crisis, ultimately impacting millions of lives across the country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Judy Chu, D-CA, introduced the Nutrition Counseling Aiding Recovery for Eating Disorders Act of 2025, aiming to expand Medicare coverage for medical nutrition therapy services for individuals diagnosed with eating disorders. The bill seeks to address the significant gap in existing Medicare services regarding nutritional therapy, which is crucial for effective treatment.

The legislation comes in response to alarming statistics surrounding eating disorders, as approximately 28.8 million Americans will experience such conditions in their lifetime. Many of these individuals are on Medicare, with an estimated 1.6 million being affected, necessitating a comprehensive approach to healthcare that includes nutrition. Studies indicate that eating disorders result in an annual economic toll of over $64 billion, placing a substantial financial burden on families and the healthcare system.

With the mortality rate from eating disorders being one of the highest among mental health illnesses, the need for timely and effective treatment has never been more urgent. The bill proposes that Medicare covers not only standard treatments but also vital nutritional therapy, which is currently excluded for outpatient and intensive services. By including these services, the act aims to ensure that patients receive well-rounded care that involves medical, psychiatric, and therapeutic support.

Moreover, the Nutrition CARE Act highlights the particular risks faced by the elderly, who may suffer from additional chronic conditions that complicate their recovery from eating disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. With this proposed legislation, Rep. Chu aims to enhance care standards for eating disorders, signaling a vital step toward comprehensive healthcare access.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2496",40434,"Rep. Costa Introduces Dairy Nutrition Incentive Program Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jim Costa, D-CA, has introduced the Dairy Nutrition Incentive Program Act, aiming to enhance nutritional access for low-income households through the promotion of dairy products. This legislation intends to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, establishing a program designed to incentivize the purchase of nutrient-rich dairy items by participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

The introduction of this bill responds to ongoing concerns regarding the dietary quality among SNAP recipients, many of whom struggle to incorporate adequate dairy products into their diets. By offering incentives at the point of purchase, the bill seeks to make it more affordable for low-income families to access essential dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.

The proposed Dairy Nutrition Incentive Program would allocate $10 million per year to support various initiatives targeting SNAP beneficiaries. It will prioritize projects that maximize direct financial incentives, ensuring that most funds directly assist program participants in purchasing dairy products. Moreover, the program mandates the use of electronic point-of-sale systems, facilitating the issuance of benefits and tracking purchases.

With an emphasis on enhancing dairy consumption, the initiative also aims to improve overall nutritional outcomes, addressing issues like food insecurity and malnutrition among vulnerable populations. The Secretary of Agriculture will oversee the evaluation of project effectiveness, ensuring that the program meets its objective of promoting healthier diets.

This legislative effort comes at a critical time as dietary-related health issues continue to rise in many communities. Proponents of the bill advocate that, by supporting dairy purchases, it not only benefits individual households but also strengthens the agricultural sector by stimulating the demand for dairy products.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-TX, has introduced the Abortion Care Awareness Act, aimed at enhancing public awareness and access to abortion and related health services. The bill proposes a national health education campaign directed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to inform the public about accessing safe abortion services and combating misinformation surrounding reproductive health.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing national debates over abortion rights, particularly following several states implementing restrictive abortion laws. Advocates argue that better information and accessibility are critical in empowering individuals to make informed health decisions. This proposed campaign is designed to target various communities, including underserved populations, and provide culturally competent information about abortion services, legal rights, and available resources.

Key provisions of the bill include outreach on medication abortion options such as mifepristone and misoprostol and guidance on differentiating legitimate healthcare providers from crisis pregnancy centers that may disseminate misleading information. The campaign aims to ensure that individuals can access accurate and comprehensive information free from stigma and disinformation.

The potential impact of the Abortion Care Awareness Act is significant; it intends to clarify the legal landscape regarding abortion and related services while facilitating access to necessary care. With public health officials underlined as essential consultants to the campaign, the bill seeks to integrate expert recommendations into its framework, promoting educated discourse around reproductive health.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it highlights a broader commitment among some lawmakers to safeguard reproductive rights and ensure equitable access to healthcare for all, especially amidst a climate marked by legal uncertainty and societal divides surrounding abortion.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jason Crow, D-CO, has introduced the End Dark Money Act, aiming to repeal restrictions that limit the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) ability to disclose the political activities of certain nonprofit organizations. This legislation is designed to enhance transparency in political contributions by allowing the IRS to use its funds to investigate and report on the political actions of these groups.

The introduction of this bill comes amidst growing concerns about the influence of untraceable money in politics, often referred to as dark money. Critics argue that this lack of transparency has undermined public trust in the electoral process. By repealing the current restrictions, Crow’s legislation seeks to ensure that the public is informed about the sources and intentions behind significant financial contributions to political causes.

If enacted, the End Dark Money Act could have significant implications for political funding and nonprofit organizations. Proponents believe that increased transparency will discourage undue influence by wealthy donors and corporations, fostering a more equitable political landscape. Supporters also argue that informed voters are better equipped to make choices that reflect their values and interests, thus strengthening democracy.

Historically, legislation aimed at increasing transparency in political contributions has garnered bipartisan support, though it often faces pushback from those advocating for privacy in donor identities. As nonprofits play an essential role in various social convictions and causes, this legislation poses a pivotal question about the balance between free speech and transparency in political expression.

The bill is now under consideration by the House Committee on Ways and Means, and advocates are urging swift passage to respond to the pressing need for clearer political funding disclosure.

The bill (H.R. 2498) was introduced on 03/31/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Josh Harder, D-CA, has introduced the Abandoned Vessel Prevention Act aimed at reducing the environmental and economic risks associated with abandoned vessels in U.S. waters. The bill seeks to assign liability to sellers of commercial vessels when they transfer the title to a new owner for recreational use without ensuring adequate insurance coverage.

The introduction of this legislation is in response to the increasing number of abandoned vessels that not only pose a threat to marine ecosystems but also create substantial financial burdens for local governments and taxpayers. When a commercial vessel is sold without insurance and subsequently sinks, the costs for removal and cleanup often fall on municipalities or state agencies, which can lead to significant taxpayer expenses.

If passed, the Abandoned Vessel Prevention Act would require sellers to ensure that the new owners possess insurance that could cover related expenses for at least 12 months post-transfer. This includes damages from the sinking, pollution cleanup, and removal of debris, thus incentivizing responsible ownership and maintenance of vessels.

The bill is particularly focused on older commercial vessels, specifying that liability would not apply to those smaller than 35 feet or younger than 40 years. By tightening regulations around vessel sales, the legislation aims to mitigate the abandonment crisis and promote accountability for vessel owners.

Rep. Harder emphasizes the importance of protecting marine environments and reducing taxpayer costs associated with abandoned vessels. The bill was referred to the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Judiciary for further review. As issues surrounding abandoned vessels continue to escalate, this proposed legislation could play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by coastal communities across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark Harris, R-NC, has introduced the Free Speech Fairness Act aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to permit charitable organizations to engage in political campaign discussions without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This legislation is designed to encourage nonprofits to voice their opinions on public policy matters pertinent to their missions, thus enhancing their active participation in the democratic process.

The impetus behind this bill arises from concerns that current restrictions overly inhibit charities from discussing candidates and political issues related to their core functions. Advocates believe that allowing these organizations to speak out can foster public discourse, thereby ensuring that important social and political issues remain in the spotlight.

If passed, the Free Speech Fairness Act would allow 501(c)(3) organizations to make political statements within the ordinary scope of their activities without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This change is expected to have significant implications for how charities navigate political landscapes, permitting them to comment on issues that directly relate to their causes, be it healthcare, education, or environmental advocacy, among others.

Proponents argue that the bill can empower nonprofits, particularly those serving marginalized communities, to leverage their platforms more freely. Increasing their ability to advocate can ultimately lead to enhanced civic engagement and broader public awareness of critical issues.

The Free Speech Fairness Act has drawn support from several lawmakers and organizations that emphasize the importance of unfiltered communication in serving the public good. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further discussion, and advocates are pushing for swift consideration to amplify the voices of charitable organizations in the upcoming electoral cycle.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-OH, has introduced the Law Enforcement Training for Mental Health Crisis Response Act of 2025, aimed at improving training for law enforcement and corrections officers in managing mental health crises. The bill seeks to authorize a grant program that would provide crucial funding to state, local, and Tribal agencies for behavioral health response training.

The initiative arises from growing concerns over the frequency of police encounters involving individuals suffering from mental health issues. Statistics show that approximately one in ten police calls involves a person with a mental illness, highlighting a pressing need for enhanced training. The bill's proponents argue that effective training can significantly reduce the risk of violent confrontations and enhance the safety of both officers and individuals in crisis.

By providing grants, this legislation would enable agencies to fund programs that equip officers with the skills necessary to de-escalate tensions and manage emergencies involving behavioral health crises. The program is designed to not only protect the public and officers but also ensure that those experiencing mental health challenges receive the appropriate support during critical moments.

The bill reflects a broader movement to address mental health issues within the law enforcement community, particularly in light of increasing demands stemming from the ongoing opioid epidemic and a general increase in mental health-related emergencies. This proactive approach aims to empower officers with evidence-based techniques for compassionate and effective engagement with those affected by mental health crises.

As the bill makes its way through the Judiciary Committee, its advocates hope to gain bipartisan support, recognizing the universal importance of mental health and the role of law enforcement in facilitating effective and humane responses.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Thomas H. Kean, R-NJ, has introduced the Undersea Cable Control Act, aiming to strengthen national security by curbing the accessibility of crucial technologies and materials utilized in the construction and maintenance of undersea cables to foreign adversaries. This measure is in response to growing concerns about the vulnerabilities within the nation's telecommunications infrastructure.

The act mandates that the President, in coordination with the Secretaries of Commerce and State, devise a comprehensive strategy to mitigate foreign access to items necessary for undersea cable projects. This initiative is a proactive stance against potential threats posed by foreign entities, particularly in light of recent geopolitical tensions. The legislation emphasizes the identification of technologies critical to undersea cable operations, along with a detailed assessment of current U.S. and allied export controls.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader push for U.S. leadership in global technological standards and export practices. By establishing bilateral and multilateral agreements with allies, the legislation seeks to unify export controls to eliminate availability to adversaries. The act is designed to promote a collaborative international approach to bolster security measures surrounding undersea cables, which are vital for global communication.

Additionally, the bill includes mandates for annual reporting to Congress on the effectiveness of these strategies and the progress of negotiations with allied nations. As undersea cables serve as the backbone of international digital communication, ensuring their security is crucial for maintaining the integrity of both national and global telecommunications systems. The Undersea Cable Control Act thus positions the U.S. government to better safeguard its technological infrastructure against potential threats.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. William R. Keating, D-MA, has introduced the U.S.-European Nuclear Energy Cooperation Act, aiming to reinforce collaborative efforts between the United States and European nations in nuclear energy. This bill mandates the Secretary of State to devise a strategy to counter Russian influence in Europe’s nuclear sector, reflecting heightened geopolitical concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The legislation emerges from growing fears over energy security and the proliferation of Russian political power through economic means, particularly in the context of nuclear energy. Europe’s reliance on Russian-designed nuclear power plants has been a focal point, especially after the occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station by Russian forces. The bill seeks to emphasize the importance of prioritizing American and allied technology and services in the nuclear energy market, bolstering economic ties while ensuring energy independence from adversarial nations.

If passed, the act would allocate $30 million annually until 2029 to facilitate US-Europe nuclear initiatives and combat disinformation campaigns. Such funding is seen as crucial for capacity building in nuclear energy, an area previously dominated by Russian technology. The legislation also emphasizes collaboration on regulatory frameworks to mitigate proliferation risks while enhancing nuclear safety standards across Europe.

Furthermore, the bill outlines specific assessments to be included in the Secretary of State's strategy, analyzing the role of various reactor types in reducing dependence on Russian supplies and evaluating the impact of American and European technologies in nuclear energy development. By fostering stronger alliances, this bill aims to enhance not just energy security, but also the geopolitical stability of the European region amid ongoing threats from Russia and, increasingly, China.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. William R. Keating, D-MA, has introduced legislation aimed at curbing the export of certain technologies that could potentially enhance Iran's unmanned aircraft systems. The bill, titled Block the Use of Transatlantic Technology in Iranian Made Drones Act, seeks to establish strategies to prevent American and allied technologies from reaching Iran, particularly as the country has been accused of supplying drones to various groups, including those opposing U.S. interests.

This bill comes in response to growing concerns about the Iranian regime's efforts to bolster its military capabilities, particularly in relation to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Recent years have seen a marked increase in incidents involving Iranian drones, which have reportedly been used by proxy groups to launch attacks. By restricting access to critical components and technologies, the legislation aims to undermine Iran's drone production and its capacity to support adversaries in conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and against Israel.

The legislation mandates cooperation among multiple U.S. agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense. These agencies must work together to develop comprehensive strategies to prevent American-made technologies from being utilized by Iranian military operations. This includes identifying manufacturers of sensitive technologies that might reach Iranian entities and ensuring that international partners align their export controls with U.S. measures.

The introduction of this bill reflects an increased urgency to combat threats posed by Iranian UAVs, as well as a broader commitment to international security amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Rep. Keating's initiative seeks to reinforce global efforts against the proliferation of military technology that endangers U.S. and allied interests.

The bill (H.R. 2505) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2506",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces AID Youth Employment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robin L. Kelly, D-IL, has introduced the AID Youth Employment Act aimed at enhancing employment opportunities for young individuals aged 14 to 24. This legislation seeks to amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to provide competitive funding for both summer and year-round employment programs targeted at the youth demographic, especially those facing barriers to employment.

The AID Youth Employment Act was proposed in response to the growing need for accessible employment options for young people, particularly in underserved communities. With rising youth unemployment and increased challenges faced by marginalized groups—including those in foster care and youth involved in the criminal justice system—this bill aims to address the pressing demand for effective job training and opportunities. 

Under the proposed act, the Secretary of Labor will allocate funds to various entities, including state and local governments, tribal organizations, and community-based organizations. These funds focus on subsidized employment and fostering essential work readiness skills. By providing both planning and implementation grants, the act encourages a collaborative approach among local educational agencies, employers, and community groups to ensure comprehensive support for young job seekers.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant, as it not only aims to provide direct job opportunities but also emphasizes developing long-term skills that enhance employability. This initiative aligns with broader efforts to combat youth unemployment and promote workforce development, particularly in areas disproportionately affected by economic hardships.

By fostering a supportive environment for youth employment, the AID Youth Employment Act positions itself as a crucial step towards equipping the next generation with the tools necessary for success in today’s job market. The bill is currently referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further discussion.

The bill (H.R. 2506) was introduced on 03/31/2025.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2507",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces HERO for Youth Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robin Kelly, D-IL, has introduced the Helping to Encourage Real Opportunities (HERO) for Youth Act aimed at expanding employment opportunities for young people. The proposed legislation seeks to modify the existing work opportunity credit under the Internal Revenue Code to better support youth employment year-round, particularly targeting disengaged youth and those who may be struggling to enter the job market.

The HERO Act addresses alarming youth unemployment and underemployment rates, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. With many young people aged 16 to 24 facing significant challenges in finding stable jobs, this bill aims to create pathways to employment by offering enhanced tax credits to employers who hire youth during both summer and school year periods. Specifically, it encourages hiring by increasing credit amounts for those who employ youth throughout the year, not just in the summer months.

This legislation also introduces provisions for “disconnected youth,” individuals aged 16 to 25 who have not recently attended school or held a job. By expanding the eligibility criteria, it recognizes the unique barriers faced by these young people, making it easier for employers to hire and support them. Such initiatives are expected to foster workforce readiness and economic stability for a demographic that often gets overlooked in traditional employment programs.

In summary, the HERO for Youth Act seeks to adapt tax incentives to promote youth employment more effectively while also addressing systemic issues contributing to youth disengagement from the workforce. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2548",40434,"Rep. Fitzpatrick Introduces Sanctioning Russia Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a legislative measure aimed at imposing significant sanctions on the Russian Federation. The bill seeks to address and deter aggressive actions by Russia against Ukraine, particularly if the Russian government declines to negotiate a peace agreement or engages in further military invasions.

The legislation emerges in the context of ongoing tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, spurred by past military actions and ongoing geopolitical threats. By enacting strict sanctions, Fitzpatrick aims to pressure the Russian government to halt its aggressive maneuvers and foster a diplomatic pathway towards peace. The proposed sanctions would target a wide range of sectors, including financial institutions, energy exports, and trade agreements, effectively restricting Russian access to U.S. markets and financial systems.

The potential impact of the Sanctioning Russia Act could extend beyond punitive measures. By reinforcing U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, the bill aims to bolster international coalition efforts against Russian aggression, signaling a united front among NATO allies. Additionally, punitive measures may contribute to economic instability within Russia, which could diminish its capacity to sustain military operations.

Fitzpatrick's initiative aligns with the broader strategy of U.S. foreign policy that prioritizes deterrence and regional stability. The legislation has been introduced to several committees, including Foreign Affairs and Financial Services, emphasizing the bipartisan concern regarding Russia's actions and the urgent need for effective policy responses. As the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, this bill exemplifies U.S. readiness to adapt its legislative framework to uphold international security standards.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2547",40434,"Rep. Feenstra Introduces Secure Family Futures Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-IA, has introduced the Secure Family Futures Act, aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to benefit specific insurance companies by adjusting the treatment of their capital assets and loss carryovers. The proposed bill seeks to exclude certain debt held by applicable insurance companies from being classified as capital assets and extends the period for capital loss carryovers from five to ten years.

The introduction of this bill is rooted in a response to the financial pressures faced by insurance companies in the current economic climate. By redefining capital assets and extending loss carryover provisions, the legislation is designed to enhance the financial stability of insurance firms, thus ensuring better coverage options for consumers. These changes are particularly significant for domestic insurance companies that maintain a large portfolio of bonds and other debts, which can affect their overall financial health.

Within the bill, a clear definition of applicable insurance companies is provided, allowing for a targeted approach while excluding foreign-based and certain other entities from these benefits. This strategic focus aims to support domestic markets and promote job retention within the insurance sector.

The Secure Family Futures Act is anticipated to have a substantial impact on the liquidity and operational capabilities of the qualifying insurance companies, which may lead to increased investments in both innovation and consumer products. As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Ways and Means, stakeholders from the insurance industry are closely monitoring its developments, highlighting the broader implications it may have on financial regulations and economic growth within the sector.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Mike Ezell, R-MS, has introduced the Secretary of the Coast Guard Act of 2025, which aims to officially establish the role of Secretary of the Coast Guard within the U.S. government structure. This legislation seeks to formalize leadership in the Coast Guard by appointing a dedicated Secretary who will report directly to the President, streamlining the chain of command.

The bill was initiated in response to ongoing discussions about governance within the Coast Guard and the need for enhanced leadership amidst evolving maritime challenges. Establishing a Secretary is expected to bolster accountability and improve operational coordination, given the diverse responsibilities the Coast Guard manages, from search and rescue to enforcing maritime laws.

If passed, this legislation could significantly impact the Coast Guard's operational efficiency. Currently, the Commandant of the Coast Guard reports to the Department of Homeland Security, but the introduction of a dedicated Secretary could allow for more focused and expedited decision-making processes. Additionally, the bill proposes that the Secretary will exercise specific powers outlined in existing maritime law, ensuring clarity of authority.

Historically, the Coast Guard has acquired various missions that span national security and environmental protection, necessitating clear representation at the cabinet level. The introduction of this bill reflects a recognition of the service’s growing complexity and the importance of having an individual whose sole focus is to lead and advocate for the needs of the Coast Guard.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where its future will be determined as Congress evaluates the need for enhanced leadership within one of the nation’s key military services.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced the Financing Our Energy Future Act, a legislative effort aimed at expanding investment opportunities in renewable energy and transportation fuels. This bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code by extending the publicly traded partnership structure to include energy power generation projects, enabling greater capital flow into the sector.

The introduction of this bill comes as the United States grapples with the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. By allowing energy projects to be structured as publicly traded partnerships, Rep. Estes aims to lower barriers to investment, attract diverse funding sources, and drive innovation in green technologies. The ultimate goal is to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while boosting domestic energy production.

This initiative is particularly relevant amid escalating concerns over climate change and fluctuating energy prices. Supporters believe that incentivizing renewable energy through increased financial flexibility will catalyze growth in the sector, potentially leading to job creation and lower energy costs for consumers. It also aligns with federal goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning toward a more sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Financing Our Energy Future Act highlights the growing recognition among policymakers of the importance of diversifying energy sources. By addressing bureaucratic hurdles and fostering a more investor-friendly climate, this legislation aims to make the U.S. a leader in renewable energy solutions. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation and is expected to spark discussion on how best to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2544",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces Financial Freedom Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the Financial Freedom Act of 2025, a legislative measure aimed at expanding investment options for participants in individual retirement accounts (IRAs). The bill seeks to prohibit the Secretary of Labor from restricting the types of investments available to individuals who manage their own IRA assets.

The primary motivation behind the Financial Freedom Act is to enhance financial independence by ensuring that individuals have greater control over their retirement savings. Currently, regulations can limit investment alternatives, potentially hindering beneficiaries' ability to diversify and optimize their portfolios according to personal preferences and risk tolerance. This legislation is designed to empower retirees by enabling them to choose from a broader range of investment options.

The potential impact of this bill could be significant for millions of Americans saving for retirement. By removing restrictions on investments, the act could facilitate higher returns and provide individuals more avenues to grow their savings, reflecting their unique financial situations and objectives. Advocates argue that increasing investment choice is vital in an era where financial literacy and aggressive saving strategies are increasingly crucial for retirement security.

The introduction of the Financial Freedom Act comes during a time of heightened focus on financial autonomy. With concerns about the adequacy of traditional retirement savings plans and the evolving landscape of personal finance, this bill aims to shift the balance of control from regulatory bodies back to the individual. If passed, the act would amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, thus reaffirming the right of individuals to manage their investments without undue interference from federal regulations.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, it will undergo further scrutiny and discussion before a potential vote on the House floor.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2543",40434,"Rep. Doggett Introduces Tax-Free Pell Grant Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-TX, has unveiled the Tax-Free Pell Grant Act, a legislative effort aimed at expanding the exclusion of Pell Grants from gross income as part of a broader tax reform initiative. This bill seeks to alleviate the financial burdens faced by low-income college students by ensuring that funds received through Pell Grants are not subject to taxation.

The need for the Tax-Free Pell Grant Act stems from rising higher education costs, which have outpaced income growth for many American families. As the cost of tuition and living expenses increases, it becomes essential to provide students with financial aid that does not add to their tax liabilities. By modifying the Internal Revenue Code, the bill aims to make higher education more accessible and affordable for thousands of students across the nation.

The potential impact of the bill is significant, as it addresses financial challenges that deter many eligible students from pursuing higher education. The proposed changes would not only assist students in managing their educational expenses but would also enhance their overall financial well-being. Moreover, the legislation is likely to incentivize enrollment and retention rates in colleges and universities, contributing to a more educated workforce.

In addition to the expanded Pell Grant exclusions, the legislation also proposes updates to the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits, making them more comprehensive. By including additional qualified expenses beyond tuition—such as computer equipment and childcare costs—the bill supports a holistic approach to higher education financing. As lawmakers deliberate on this proposal, its focus on expanding educational opportunities reflects a commitment to investing in the future of America's youth.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Donald G. Davis, D-NC, has introduced the Old Drugs, New Cures Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at reforming how Medicare and Medicaid calculate manufacturer rebates for certain medications. This initiative seeks to amend the Social Security Act so that specific, priority research drugs are not categorized as line extensions of existing medications when calculating rebates, potentially facilitating the introduction of new treatments to address unmet medical needs.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to ongoing concerns regarding access to breakthrough therapies for chronic conditions, particularly among populations dependent on federal healthcare programs. By clarifying the status of priority research drugs, the legislation aims to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new uses for older medications, which could lead to innovative solutions for prevalent health issues.

The bill outlines a framework for designating a drug as a priority research drug, enabling manufacturers to pursue new indications for long-established medications. This provides a streamlined path for drugs that have been on the market for at least a decade and address significant medical needs, thus encouraging manufacturers to investigate new applications.

If passed, the Old Drugs, New Cures Act could have far-reaching implications for patients reliant on Medicare and Medicaid. By enabling faster access to revitalized drug therapies, the legislation hopes to improve health outcomes and reduce costs associated with treating chronic conditions. It highlights the importance of adapting regulatory frameworks to foster innovation within the pharmaceutical industry, particularly as the nation grapples with an increasing demand for effective healthcare solutions.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2541",40434,"Rep. Davis Introduces Nuclear Medicine Clarification Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Donald G. Davis, D-NC, has introduced the Nuclear Medicine Clarification Act aimed at enhancing patient safety during nuclear medicine procedures. The bill mandates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to revise its regulations to prevent unintended radiation exposure to patients, thus addressing critical health concerns in medical settings.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing scrutiny over radiation safety protocols within nuclear medicine. Recent incidents of accidental overdoses due to extravasation—where radioactive substances unintentionally leak into surrounding tissues—have highlighted the need for stringent guidelines. The National Institutes of Health has reported adverse health effects related to such exposures, emphasizing the importance of regulatory updates.

The Nuclear Medicine Clarification Act is designed to specify reporting standards for medical events involving unintended irradiation. Under the proposed legislation, the NRC is instructed to revise its rules to include clear thresholds for what constitutes a significant dose of radiation, thereby improving accountability and patient protection. This includes identifying doses over 0.5 Sv (50 rem) for skin and tissue that could cause health complications.

The potential impact of this legislation is substantial, not only in improving patient safety but also in fostering greater confidence in medical procedures that utilize radioactive materials. By mandating these regulatory changes, the bill aims to promote a culture of safety and transparency within healthcare institutions.

As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, stakeholders in the medical community and patient advocacy groups are closely monitoring developments. The Nuclear Medicine Clarification Act represents a proactive approach to safeguarding patients, reinforcing the commitment to health and safety in nuclear medicine practices.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-IL, has introduced the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act, aiming to significantly update the resource limits for eligibility in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. This legislation proposes increasing the limit for individuals from $2,250 to $20,000, and for couples from $1,500 to $10,000, effective in 2025. 

The motivation behind this bill stems from the increasing financial pressures faced by low-income individuals and families who rely on SSI for basic support. Currently, many potential beneficiaries are deterred from saving money due to restrictive asset limits, which penalize those who attempt to establish financial stability. The proposed changes not only aim to alleviate this burden but are also tied to future inflation adjustments, ensuring that limits remain relevant over time.

This legislative action has the potential to positively impact millions of Americans who depend on SSI, particularly those living in high-cost areas where even minimal savings can significantly improve their quality of life. By removing the disincentives associated with saving, the bill encourages responsible financial practices that can lead to more sustainable living situations.

Historically, the SSI program was designed to assist individuals with disabilities and the elderly who have limited income and resources. However, the current caps on savings have not kept pace with inflation or the rising costs of living, leading to calls for reform. Rep. Davis's initiative is part of a broader movement among lawmakers to modernize social welfare policies, ensuring that they effectively meet the needs of today's population. 

The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act is now referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Jane Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Climate Resilience Act aimed at enhancing the United States' ability to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. The legislation proposes funding for infrastructure improvements, community planning initiatives, and research projects that focus on resilience building in vulnerable areas.

The Climate Resilience Act is a response to increasing natural disasters and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change. According to recent studies, the frequency of severe storms, wildfires, and floods is rising, necessitating a proactive approach to protect communities and vital infrastructure. Rep. Smith emphasized the importance of equipping local governments with the resources needed to address these challenges head-on.

If passed, the bill could have significant implications for cities across the country, particularly those in high-risk zones. By allocating federal funds to support adaptable infrastructure and sustainable urban planning, the Climate Resilience Act aims to mitigate future damages and reduce costs related to disaster recovery. This legislation complements prior initiatives focused on emission reductions and transitioning to renewable energy sources, representing a comprehensive strategy for combating climate change.

The need for such legislation has become increasingly urgent as climate-related incidents not only threaten lives but also strain state and local budgets. With calls for a significant investment in resilience measures, the Climate Resilience Act could set a new precedent in federal policy, prioritizing the safety and sustainability of communities nationwide.

As discussions around climate policy continue to evolve, Rep. Smith’s bill highlights the importance of taking immediate and long-term action to safeguard the nation against looming environmental threats.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Mike Carey, R-OH, has introduced the Comprehensive Alternative Response for Emergencies Act of 2025, aimed at addressing deficiencies in emergency medical response under the Medicare program. This innovative legislation is designed to enable the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to implement a comprehensive alternative model, aimed primarily at enhancing emergency medical interventions.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to longstanding concerns regarding the efficiency of emergency medical services (EMS) and the crucial role they play in patient outcomes. Reports have indicated that traditional emergency transportation may not account for all aspects of patient care, particularly situations where interventions can be critical without requiring full transport to a medical facility. By expanding payment models to include emergency medical responses that do not necessitate transportation, the legislation seeks to improve care delivery in high-pressure situations.

If passed, the CARE Act will allow providers of ground ambulance services to be reimbursed for emergency response services that meet specific criteria, including those that employ telehealth solutions. The bill outlines payment frameworks that align with existing Medicare payment structures, ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to timely medical interventions while also easing financial strains on EMS providers. 

Furthermore, the act mandates a report from the U.S. Comptroller General assessing the model's effectiveness after four years, focusing on beneficiary outcomes and resource utilization, thereby providing a feedback loop for ongoing improvement of emergency services. The CARE Act has potential implications for regions with varying demographics, ensuring equitable access to emergency medical care for all Medicare recipients. As it moves through Congress, advocates and stakeholders underscore the importance of reforming EMS to meet modern healthcare needs effectively.

This bill aims to ensure continued collaboration among diverse interests concerning conservation efforts in the Deschutes River Basin.

The legislation seeks to amend the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996, allowing for the reauthorization of the Working Group until 2032. The group consists of a balanced board of directors that includes representatives from the environmental community, agriculture, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation, hydroelectric production, federal agencies, state agencies, and local government. This structure is designed to foster a collaborative approach to managing the river's resources effectively.

The introduction of this bill is a response to growing concerns about water management and environmental preservation in the Deschutes River Basin. Stakeholders, including conservationists and agricultural representatives, have expressed the need for sustained cooperative efforts as the region faces challenges related to water scarcity and habitat conservation. The emphasis on collaboration among various community representatives is intended to work towards it to protect both the ecological integrity of the river and the livelihoods that depend on it.

Additionally, the bill increases the administrative cost allocation for the Working Group from 5% to 10%, reflecting the need for additional resources to effectively manage and implement the group's initiatives. As challenges related to climate change and resource allocation intensify, the reauthorization aims to fortify efforts to balance agricultural activity with environmental conservation. 

If passed, this bill will play a crucial role in shaping sustainable resource management practices in the Deschutes River Basin for the next several years.

The bill (H.R. 2537) was introduced on 04/01/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-IL, has introduced the New Producer Economic Security Act, legislation aimed at establishing the New Producer Economic Security Program under the auspices of the Farm Service Agency. This initiative is intended to bolster support for new and aspiring farmers by providing grants and resources for those who have not operated a farm for more than ten years or who are economically disadvantaged.

The motivation behind this bill stems from the growing challenges faced by new producers in accessing land, capital, and resources necessary for establishing a successful agricultural business. With rising land costs and limited access to financing, many potential farmers struggle to enter the industry. By targeting resources to this demographic, the legislation aims to foster a more inclusive farm community and enhance food security across the nation.

If enacted, the New Producer Economic Security Program will prioritize projects that assist qualified beneficiaries while enhancing community-led solutions. It will also encourage diverse partnerships among public and private entities to maximize the impact of financial assistance provided. The program outlines various activities, such as down payment assistance for property acquisition, technical support, and infrastructure improvements, crucial for establishing sustainable farming practices.

The bill has garnered bipartisan support, reflecting a collective recognition of the need to support new agricultural entrants. As Congress considers this proposal, its potential impact on rural economies and the broader agricultural landscape will be closely monitored. By facilitating access to essential resources and promoting innovative approaches to land ownership, the New Producer Economic Security Act aims to pave the way for a new generation of farmers in America.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2535",40434,"Rep. Brownley Introduces FEMA Temporary Housing Assistance Improvement Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Julia Brownley, D-CA, has introduced the FEMA Temporary Housing Assistance Improvement Act, a legislative measure aimed at reforming the eligibility criteria for temporary housing assistance following disasters. This bill seeks to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by stipulating that insurance payments should not be considered a duplication of benefits when assessing eligibility for temporary housing assistance.

The legislation was introduced in response to concerns that current policies may inadvertently penalize disaster survivors who have insurance coverage. Critics argue that the existing rules have left many individuals underfunded when attempting to secure temporary housing after suffering substantial losses from natural disasters. By clarifying this provision, the bill aims to ensure that affected individuals can access critical support without being disqualified based on their insurance status.

If enacted, the FEMA Temporary Housing Assistance Improvement Act would deliver immediate relief to those impacted by disasters, promoting recovery by facilitating access to necessary housing. This move is particularly important as the frequency and severity of disasters continue to rise, highlighting the need for a responsive and fair system to assist affected populations. By eliminating insurance considerations from the eligibility equation, the bill is designed to prevent undue financial hardship on survivors who may still face gaps in their coverage.

Rep. Brownley's bill was referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where it will undergo further examination. Its progress will be closely watched as legislators consider the best methods for enhancing disaster response and assistance programs in the face of escalating natural calamities.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2534",40434,"Rep. Boyle Introduces Paying a Fair Share Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-PA, has introduced the Paying a Fair Share Act, aimed at ensuring high-income earners contribute a fairer share to federal taxes. The bill, presented on April 1, 2025, seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code by implementing a new fair share tax on individuals with an adjusted gross income exceeding $1 million.

The rationale behind the bill stems from growing concerns about income inequality and the tax burdens placed predominantly on middle-class families. Proponents argue that wealthier individuals currently benefit from numerous tax loopholes, allowing them to pay a disproportionately lower percentage of taxes compared to their income levels. By introducing this legislation, Rep. Boyle aims to generate additional revenue for government programs and help reduce the federal deficit.

The proposed tax would function as an incremental charge, applied directly to high-income earners, calculated based on their adjusted gross income minus a modified charitable contribution deduction. The bill also mandates a phase-in structure, allowing high-income taxpayers to gradually adjust to the new tax standards. This approach is anticipated to mitigate the immediate financial impact on those affected while still increasing tax revenues in the long term.

Should the bill gain traction, it could potentially raise billions of dollars per year for federal initiatives. This increased revenue may support critical services, such as healthcare and education, while also addressing the growing calls for tax reform that advocates say is necessary to create a more equitable taxation system.

As the bill awaits action in the House Committee on Ways and Means, it reflects a broader legislative intention to tackle systemic inequalities in the tax code and ensure that affluent individuals contribute their fair share to the nation’s financial responsibilities.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-TX, introduced the Ensuring Access to Specialty care Everywhere Act of 2025, aiming to enhance service accessibility for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, especially in rural areas. The bill was submitted on April 1, 2025, and is currently under consideration by the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means.

The EASE Act seeks to address persistent disparities in healthcare access for individuals living in remote regions. By mandating that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) test a new model for delivering specialty care services through digital modalities—such as telehealth—the legislation aims to facilitate better health outcomes for underserved populations. This initiative comes in response to findings indicating that patients in rural areas often face significant barriers in accessing specialty care providers.

The proposed model within the EASE Act would facilitate a collaborative framework between selected provider networks and patients' primary care providers. By leveraging technology, these networks would be responsible for delivering specialty services while also integrating data collection and evaluation methods to improve care over time. The requirements for provider networks include a composition of at least 50 Federally Qualified Health Centers and critical access hospitals, emphasizing a commitment to supporting areas in need.

This bill represents a significant step toward closing the healthcare gap for millions of Americans who struggle to access essential medical services. With ongoing discussions in Congress about healthcare reform, Rep. Arrington's EASE Act highlights a targeted approach to resolving long-standing issues that disproportionately impact rural and underserved communities. If passed, it could reshape the landscape of specialty healthcare accessibility in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2532",40434,"Rep. McClellan Introduces Employee Protection Bill for Health Department Staff","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Jennifer L. McClellan, D-VA, has introduced a significant bill aimed at prohibiting certain removals of employees within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its sub-agencies. The legislation seeks to safeguard the jobs of HHS employees amidst ongoing concerns over workforce reductions and organizational restructuring.

The bill is a response to increasing worries about staff cuts that could impair the efficacy of HHS, particularly during a time when public health remains a national priority. By restricting the potential removal of more than 3% of the workforce within a 60-day timeframe, the legislation aims to maintain continuity and stability within such a critical department. This restriction applies not only to the department as a whole but also to individual sub-agencies, ensuring that localized operations are not adversely affected.

The introduction of this bill comes at a crucial juncture as public health systems face heightened scrutiny and demand, particularly in the wake of recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Protecting HHS employees is not just about job security; it is about preserving institutional knowledge and expertise that is vital for effective public health responses.

Furthermore, the bill has garnered support from several colleagues, indicating a bipartisan recognition of the importance of stabilizing the workforce within HHS. As the legislative process unfolds, the potential impact may extend beyond employee protection to ensuring a robust public health infrastructure capable of addressing future challenges.

Rep. McClellan’s proposal has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, Education and Workforce, Ways and Means, and Natural Resources for further consideration, emphasizing the multi-faceted implications of workforce policies within the government.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Joe Courtney, D-CT, has introduced the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act aimed at establishing stricter safety regulations within the health care and social service sectors. This legislation mandates that employers in these industries develop and implement comprehensive plans to prevent workplace violence, reflecting growing concerns over safety for frontline workers.

The bill responds to an alarming rise in instances of violence against health care and social service workers, a problem exacerbated by the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. As more reports of assaults surface, advocates assert that it is critical to create safer environments for these essential providers. The proposed legislation not only requires comprehensive workplace violence prevention plans but also mandates training and resources to improve employee safety and well-being.

Under this bill, the Secretary of Labor would be tasked with issuing a standard requiring employers to conduct risk assessments and develop prevention strategies tailored to specific workplace conditions. This would entail collaboration between management and employees for effective implementation of safety measures. Moreover, the bill proposes the establishment of a reporting system for violent incidents, ensuring that employers investigate and address the circumstances surrounding these occurrences.

The impact of such regulations could be profound, promoting a cultural shift in the workplace that prioritizes the health and safety of employees. By legally mandating these protections, the bill is positioned to potentially decrease incidents of workplace violence in health care settings, ultimately benefitting those who rely on these vital services.

As the bill moves forward, it has garnered support from various advocacy groups focused on worker safety and mental health, reflecting a broad consensus on the need for improved workplace conditions.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-UT, introduced the Healthy Lunch for Healthy Kids Act on April 1, 2025, aiming to enhance nutritional standards within the National School Lunch Program. The bill seeks to amend existing regulations by prohibiting the serving of ultraprocessed foods and items containing certain food additives, including yellow and red dyes.

The initiative arises amid growing concerns over children's dietary health and the prevalence of obesity in youth across the country. With many school lunches containing high levels of additives and low nutritional value, advocates argue that revising these guidelines is crucial to fostering healthier eating habits in students. The bill’s supporters emphasize the need for schools to serve meals that contribute positively to students' physical and cognitive development.

If passed, the Healthy Lunch for Healthy Kids Act could significantly impact school cafeterias, mandating a shift toward freshly prepared meals and more whole foods. This reform is expected to inspire food manufacturers to innovate healthier product options that align with the new standards. The focus on eliminating specific harmful additives reflects a growing trend towards transparency and safety in food consumption, particularly for vulnerable populations like children.

The legislation comes as lawmakers increasingly recognize the role of nutrition in public health debate, particularly in light of rising healthcare costs associated with preventable diseases linked to poor diets. Rep. Kennedy’s bill, now referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, reflects a proactive approach to improving children's health outcomes, ensuring the next generation has access to balanced and nourishing meals at school. The bill's progression will be closely monitored as discussions about children's health policies continue to evolve.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2529",40434,"Rep. Underwood Introduces Convenient Contraception Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-IL, has introduced the Convenient Contraception Act aimed at providing individuals the option to obtain a 365-day supply of contraceptives through their health insurance plans. This legislation seeks to eliminate barriers to access for contraceptive coverage, ultimately supporting women's reproductive health and empowering them with consistent contraceptive management.

The bill arises amid ongoing debates surrounding reproductive rights and access to healthcare. Underwood emphasized the need for policies that enable women to plan their families without unnecessary interruptions. Currently, many women face logistical challenges and increased costs when obtaining monthly prescriptions, which the bill aims to address by allowing a full year’s supply in a single fill.

If enacted, the law would require that group health plans and individual health insurance policies permit enrollees to obtain a comprehensive supply of contraceptives, thereby empowering their reproductive choices. The requirement will apply to plan years starting January 1, 2026, and mandates that no additional cost-sharing be implemented for this extended supply.

Research indicates that consistent access to contraceptives significantly contributes to improved health outcomes for women and their families. By offering a convenient and financially manageable option, the Convenient Contraception Act could reduce unintended pregnancies and their associated societal costs.

Additionally, the bill will facilitate outreach efforts by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury to ensure health care providers and eligible individuals understand their benefits under the new legislation. This proactive approach aims to enhance awareness and utilization of contraceptive resources, ultimately benefiting public health. 

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it reflects a broader commitment to reproductive health and women's rights in America.

"$H billintroh-250401-hr2528",40434,"Rep. Walberg Introduces Association Health Plans Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Tim Walberg, R-MI, has introduced the Association Health Plans Act, which aims to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. The bill seeks to clarify how certain association health plans are classified as employers, enabling greater flexibility for employer groups when providing health insurance options.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about healthcare access and affordability in the United States. The current structure of healthcare plans under ERISA has often restricted small employers and self-employed individuals from pursuing group health insurance options effectively. By allowing associations to be treated as employers, the bill is intended to strengthen this sector by pooling risks and potentially lowering premium costs for members.

The potential impact of the Association Health Plans Act includes expanding access to affordable healthcare for small businesses and their employees, as well as self-employed individuals. It aims to facilitate the creation of plans that can leverage collective bargaining power, which is particularly crucial for those facing challenges in the complex insurance marketplace. Furthermore, the bill promises strict guidelines to prevent discrimination based on health status, ensuring fair treatment for all employees covered under these plans.

Historically, association health plans have faced scrutiny regarding their ability to provide quality coverage without significant regulatory oversight. This legislation addresses those concerns by outlining necessary criteria for associations to operate as legitimate employers, ensuring adherence to health-related protections while promoting broader access to their member organizations. As discussions advance in the House Education and Workforce Committee, the outcomes of this bill could signal significant changes in how healthcare is provided to small businesses across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Marc A. Veasey, D-TX, has introduced the Early Detection of Vision Impairments for Children Act, aimed at improving children’s eye health through the establishment of statewide detection and intervention programs. The bill seeks to provide grants to states, territories, and tribal organizations, enhancing early screening and intervention initiatives designed to identify vision concerns in children.

Notably, the bill is a response to rising concerns over childhood vision impairments and their long-term impact on development and education. Research indicates that early detection can significantly improve outcomes for affected children. The legislation proposes funding for initiatives such as implementing standardized vision screenings, collecting data on children’s vision health, and coordinating public health efforts to raise awareness among families and educational institutions.

If passed, the legislation will not only facilitate direct funding for vision health programs but also emphasize collaboration among state and local entities. Eligible applicants include state educational agencies, public health departments, and community organizations that can demonstrate a commitment to children’s eye health. The grants aim to support a range of activities, from promoting eye care referrals to enhancing educational resources for families regarding children's vision.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. The proposed funding allocation is set at $5 million annually from 2026 to 2030, highlighting the government’s commitment to tackling childhood vision issues proactively. As pediatric eye disorders frequently go unrecognized, the Early Detection of Vision Impairments for Children Act represents a significant step toward ensuring children receive the necessary support to thrive.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Innovation Act, a comprehensive initiative aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies across the United States. The bill seeks to allocate significant federal funding for research and grants to foster innovation in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy sources.

The Clean Energy Innovation Act was introduced in response to growing concerns over climate change and the need for more sustainable energy solutions. With the effects of global warming becoming increasingly evident, this legislative effort aims to position the U.S. as a leader in clean energy technology while creating jobs in the growing green economy. The bill outlines a series of incentives for businesses and researchers focused on energy efficiency technologies, carbon capture methods, and alternative fuels.

One of the key aspects of the bill is its emphasis on collaboration between government agencies and private enterprises. By facilitating partnerships, the legislation aims to pool resources and expertise to overcome existing barriers to innovation in clean energy.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2525",40434,"Rep. Titus Introduces Housing Vouchers Fairness Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Dina Titus, D-NV, has introduced the Housing Vouchers Fairness Act, aimed at addressing the escalating housing affordability challenges in rapidly growing urban areas. The proposed legislation authorizes $2 billion for rental vouchers to assist residents in high population areas, responding to the critical need for increased financial support in housing.

The Housing Vouchers Fairness Act is designed to remedy disparities in current housing assistance, particularly in regions experiencing significant population growth. According to the bill, approximately $2 billion would be allocated yearly to public housing agencies serving areas with populations exceeding 100,000, ensuring they receive adequate funding to meet the rising demand for affordable housing solutions.

Introduced amid a backdrop of rising housing costs and stagnant wages, the bill highlights an urgent need for government action. As cities face increased demand for housing, many public housing agencies have struggled to keep pace with voucher allocations, resulting in historical shortfalls. The new framework intends to deliver more equitable assistance, based on not only population size but also the actual housing affordability needs of these communities.

If enacted, the legislation is expected to have widespread implications, potentially providing relief to thousands struggling with housing instability. In recent years, housing affordability has emerged as a pressing issue in many regions, leading to calls for comprehensive reforms in housing policy. By focusing on vulnerable populations in rapidly developing areas, the Housing Vouchers Fairness Act promotes a more inclusive approach to housing assistance.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for consideration. Stakeholders in the housing sector are closely monitoring its progress as advocates argue that immediate legislative action is necessary to alleviate the ongoing housing crisis.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2524",40434,"Rep. Tenney Introduces REPEAL CBO Requirements Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the REPEAL CBO Requirements Act, aimed at amending the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. This legislation seeks to allow Congress to obtain budget estimates from reputable private accounting firms, thereby reducing reliance on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for budget assessments.

The introduction of this bill responds to ongoing criticisms regarding the perceived inefficiencies of the CBO in providing timely and accurate budget estimates. Proponents argue that empowering Congress to consult established accounting firms could lead to more reliable financial assessments, potentially expediting the legislative process surrounding budgetary matters. This move reflects a broader push for legislative efficiency and responsiveness to external economic shifts.

Notably, the proposed act stipulates that private accounting firms can provide estimates for legislation intended by congressional committees, excluding the Appropriations Committees. This new provision would enable these estimates to serve as the primary assessments during the budgeting process, which advocates believe could streamline fiscal accountability and improve public confidence in congressional budgeting efforts.

The impact of this legislation, if passed, could significantly alter how budgetary oversight is administered in Congress. By permitting estimates from private firms, the reliance on CBO-generated estimates, which some lawmakers find overly conservative or slow, would diminish. Critics, however, caution that privatizing budget estimates may introduce partisan biases from firms representing specific interests.

In an era of increasing scrutiny over fiscal responsibility, Rep. Tenney’s bill is poised to prompt a vigorous debate about the role of government agencies versus private entities in public finance. As it stands, the bill has been referred to the House Rules and Budget Committees for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the State-Level Departments of Government Efficiency Establishment Act, aiming to enhance fiscal oversight in states. The bill seeks to condition the disbursement of federal funds to states on their establishment of a dedicated agency focused on governmental efficiency.

This proposed legislation responds to growing concerns over waste and inefficiencies in government spending. The act stipulates that starting in fiscal year 2026, no discretionary federal appropriations can be released to any state that does not create a government efficiency agency. Such an entity would be responsible for reviewing the management of federal funds and recommending improvements to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.

The bill mandates these efficiency agencies to comprise 10 to 20 members evenly split between the majority and minority parties in each state legislature. Moreover, each agency must publish annual reports outlining their findings and suggestions for improved fund expenditures, addressing operational and legislative efficiencies. These reports would also be submitted to the federal Department of Government Efficiency.

The impact of this legislation could be significant, fostering greater accountability at the state level and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are used more effectively. Proponents argue that it could lead to more prudent fiscal management, while critics may express concerns about federal overreach into state affairs.

Tenney's initiative aligns with increasing bipartisan support for ensuring responsible use of public funds, reflecting a broader legislative trend towards transparency and accountability in government operations. As the bill moves through committee review, its future and potential reception across party lines will be closely monitored.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced a bill aimed at designating an area in the District of Columbia as Jimmy Lai Way. This measure honors Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong democracy advocate currently imprisoned under controversial circumstances, and underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting human rights globally.

The bill's introduction comes in the wake of increasing concerns over human rights violations in Hong Kong, particularly following the implementation of the National Security Law in 2020. Lai has been incarcerated since December 2020 on charges widely deemed politically motivated. His imprisonment has drawn international condemnation and highlights a broader crackdown on dissent in the region.

This legislation aims not only to commemorate Lai but also to serve as a symbol of resilience for democracy advocates. By renaming the designated area between the intersections of 18th Street Northwest and Church Street Northwest, and 18th Street Northwest and P Street Northwest, as Jimmy Lai Way, the U.S. signals its ongoing support for the fight against oppression.

Furthermore, the bill encourages the U.S. Postal Service to acknowledge an address redesignation as 1 Jimmy Lai Way Northwest, which will facilitate mail delivery to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the U.S. intended for Lai. Proponents of the bill argue that every act of solidarity matters, emphasizing the importance of visibility for human rights issues affecting Hong Kong and similar situations worldwide.

The push for this designation reflects a growing bipartisan effort in Congress to address human rights abuses and support pro-democracy figures under duress. With this initiative, lawmakers hope to elevate Jimmy Lai's plight and mobilize further action on behalf of political prisoners around the globe.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the American Family FAFSA Opportunity Act, aimed at reforming the federal student aid process under the Higher Education Act of 1965. This legislation seeks to eliminate the sibling penalty, a provision that currently penalizes families with multiple children in college by affecting their financial aid assessments.

This bill was motivated by concerns from families who face increased financial burdens when more than one child pursues higher education simultaneously. The proposed amendment modifies how financial assessments are calculated for student aid eligibility, ensuring that families with multiple enrolled students receive a fairer evaluation that does not disproportionately disadvantage them.

If enacted, the legislation is expected to significantly alleviate financial pressures for numerous families, thereby promoting equal access to educational opportunities. This change could encourage more families to pursue higher education without the fear of increased costs associated with multiple children in college at the same time.

The American Family FAFSA Opportunity Act comes at a time when higher education costs are consistently rising, and many families are struggling to fund their children's college education. By addressing this particular aspect of the financial aid framework, the bill aims to advance equity within education financing.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further discussion and consideration. If passed, the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 award year, potentially impacting countless families seeking financial aid for multiple children attending college. Rep. Smith's initiative reflects a growing recognition of the need for reform in educational funding mechanisms to support all families effectively.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-CA, has introduced the César E. Chávez and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park Act, aiming to establish a national historical park honoring the significant contributions of César E. Chávez and the farmworker movement across California and Arizona. This initiative recognizes various historical sites associated with Chávez, which tell the story of the struggle for labor rights and the dignity of farmworkers.

The legislation seeks to preserve and interpret vital historical resources tied to Chávez's legacy, including the César E. Chávez National Monument in Keene, California, which has served as the United Farm Workers' headquarters. The bill also points to additional significant locations, such as The Forty Acres in Delano and the Santa Rita Center in Phoenix, that will enhance public understanding of the farmworker movement's impact on American history.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when the recognition of labor rights has gained increased attention, with many advocating for improved conditions and acknowledgment of the vital contributions workers make to society. Establishing the historical park not only aims to educate visitors about Chávez's work but also to inspire future generations to appreciate labor rights and social justice.

By expanding the boundaries of the existing national monument and providing for the inclusion of more historical sites, this act looks to create a network of locations where the history of farmworkers is preserved and celebrated.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-ME, has introduced the Fishing Industry Credit Enhancement Act of 2025, aimed at bolstering the U.S. commercial fishing sector. This legislation seeks to amend the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to extend financial support to commercial fishing operations and the businesses providing essential services to them.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to ongoing challenges facing the fishing industry, including economic pressures and sustainability concerns. With fishing being a critical economic driver for coastal communities, Rep. Pingree aims to enhance access to necessary credit and financial services, ultimately supporting job preservation and growth in this pivotal sector.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Burgess Owens, R-UT, has introduced the Accreditation for College Excellence Act, a legislative measure aimed at amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to eliminate political litmus tests in college accreditation processes. The bill seeks to ensure that accreditation agencies do not impose ideological requirements on educational institutions or their personnel.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing concerns regarding the perceived politicization of academia. Proponents argue that current practices can create an environment where institutions may feel pressured to adhere to specific political ideologies to secure accreditation. This legislation aims to establish a framework that protects institutions' independence from such pressures, thereby promoting academic freedom and diversity of thought.

The potential impact of this bill is significant. By prohibiting accreditation agencies from using political or ideological criteria in their evaluations, the legislation would allow schools to maintain their educational integrity and uphold a wide range of viewpoints. This could foster a more inclusive atmosphere that encourages diverse opinions and robust debate within academic environments.

In the context of recent discussions around academic freedom, the Accreditation for College Excellence Act aims to address the rising tensions between ideology and education. Critics of political litmus tests in higher education argue that these practices can stifle dissenting viewpoints and undermine the core values of free expression and inquiry in academic institutions. The bill’s supporters believe it serves as a necessary safeguard against these trends and would restore trust in the accreditation process.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Troy E. Nehls, R-TX, has introduced the Trucker Bathroom Access Act, aiming to improve restroom accessibility for commercial drivers across the nation. This legislation mandates that drivers delivering goods or waiting to be loaded at commercial establishments have access to restroom facilities, thereby addressing a critical issue for those in the trucking industry.

The bill was born out of the ongoing concerns regarding the limited access to restrooms for truck drivers, particularly during long hauls. Many drivers report difficulties in finding places to relieve themselves during their shifts, which can lead to health complications and overall dissatisfaction with their work conditions. By mandating that commercial venues accommodate restroom access, the Trucker Bathroom Access Act seeks not only to support driver health but also enhance their overall working environment.

The proposed law defines a covered driver as any commercial vehicle operator under federal hours of service regulations and establishes requirements for covered restroom facilities. These facilities must be accessible without posing health or security risks to drivers or establishments. Importantly, the legislation will not require establishments to make extensive renovations; it simply mandates access to existing restrooms.

The potential impact of this legislation could be significant. With the trucking industry facing staffing shortages, providing better working conditions is crucial for attracting and retaining drivers. Supporters argue that this legislation will reduce the stress and inconvenience that comes with finding suitable restroom facilities, ultimately leading to improved morale and job performance among drivers.

By ensuring that basic human needs are met, the Trucker Bathroom Access Act represents a step forward in recognizing the vital role that truck drivers play in the U.S. economy. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Daniel Meuser, R-PA, has introduced the CFPB Inspector General Reform Act, aimed at increasing oversight of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) by requiring Senate confirmation for its Inspector General. This legislative move is part of a broader initiative to improve accountability within federal financial agencies.

The bill comes in response to growing concerns about the CFPB’s operations and its impact on consumers. By mandating Senate confirmation for the Inspector General, the proposal intends to enhance transparency and ensure that appointees are subject to broader scrutiny. Supporters believe this will foster a more rigorous approach to oversight, thereby promoting greater integrity within the CFPB, which has been criticized for its handling of consumer protections.

The proposed reforms also stipulate that the Inspector General of the CFPB will be required to report to Congress biannually, compelling the office to maintain a proactive stance in informing lawmakers about its findings and recommendations. Furthermore, the bill mandates that 2% of the Bureau’s annual funding be allocated specifically for the Office of Inspector General, ensuring that adequate resources are available for oversight functions.

As the House bill progresses through committees, advocates for reform emphasize the potential positive ramifications for consumer advocacy and regulatory practices. Strengthening the role of the Inspector General within this influential federal agency could lead to more effective enforcement of consumer rights and a clearer path for accountability in financial oversight.

The bill seeks to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, allowing beneficiaries to purchase hot foods and meals ready for immediate consumption.

The introduction of this bill comes as many advocates highlight the challenges faced by low-income individuals and families in accessing nutritious meal options. Currently, SNAP benefits restrict purchases of hot and prepared foods, which can impose barriers for those who may not have access to cooking facilities or face time constraints in their daily lives. By expanding these benefits, the Hot Foods Act seeks to improve food security and nutrition for millions of Americans.

Should the bill pass, it is expected to have significant positive outcomes. Enabling the purchase of hot foods could lead to improved dietary outcomes for SNAP recipients, supporting healthier eating habits right from the point of purchase. This adjustment is particularly crucial as many families rely on grocery stores and convenience shops that may only offer prepared meals without a means to cook at home.

The bill has garnered bipartisan support, with co-sponsors including representatives from both sides of the aisle. By addressing a practical need, Meng's legislation speaks to the necessity of adapting federal nutrition programs to better serve contemporary needs. As lawmakers evaluate the wide-ranging impacts of policies on public health and nutritional access, the Hot Foods Act presents an opportunity for progress in reducing food insecurity while promoting healthier choices.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2511",40434,"Rep. Menendez Introduces Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act","
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Rep. Robert Menendez, D-NJ, has introduced the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act aimed at enhancing consumer protection regarding caffeine consumption. The bill addresses potential health risks associated with caffeine intake, particularly for vulnerable populations, by establishing new labeling requirements for caffeinated products while also mandating a comprehensive review of caffeine safety.

Prompted by rising concerns over caffeine-related health issues, especially among children and vulnerable individuals, the bill seeks to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It requires restaurants and retail food establishments to clearly label menu items containing high caffeine levels—specifically those with over 150 milligrams per serving. Additionally, food products with over 10 milligrams of caffeine will need to provide detailed labeling that specifies the total caffeine content and whether it is naturally occurring or an additive.

By mandating these consumer notifications, the act aims to mitigate the risks associated with excessive caffeine consumption, which can lead to anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular problems, particularly in sensitive groups. Furthermore, it necessitates a review by the FDA to assess caffeine's safety and its classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in food and dietary supplements. This review will also inform any regulatory updates needed to better protect public health.

The legislation encourages public education campaigns about safe caffeine consumption, focusing on risks related to overconsumption and its effects on vulnerable groups. Complementing these efforts, the bill calls for a study by the Government Accountability Office on the marketing practices of caffeinated beverages to ensure transparency and consumer awareness.

Ultimately, the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act embodies a proactive approach to caffeine regulation, prioritizing consumer safety and informed choices in an era of increasing caffeinated product availability.

The bill (H.R. 2511) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2508",40434,"Rep. Lieu Introduces ENCRYPT Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, has introduced the ENCRYPT Act of 2025, a significant legislative measure aimed at preempting state-level data security mandates that could compromise user privacy. The bill seeks to prevent states from imposing requirements for software developers and manufacturers to weaken the security features of their products, particularly regarding encryption.

The introduction of this bill stems from growing concerns about state-level attempts to mandate vulnerabilities in digital products that could potentially aid law enforcement agencies in surveillance efforts. Proponents argue that such actions undermine the fundamental rights to privacy and security for individuals in the digital age. By establishing a federal standard, the ENCRYPT Act aims to protect user data integrity while maintaining robust encryption technologies.

If passed, the ENCRYPT Act would effectively block states from forcing companies to create backdoors into encrypted services or products. This is particularly relevant as technology companies implement more stringent security protocols to protect personal and sensitive information from cyber threats. The bill aims to ensure that innovation in cybersecurity remains robust and that consumers' trust in digital products is upheld.

The proposed legislation defines covered products or services broadly to include computer hardware, software, and various online services, signifying comprehensive protection for a diverse range of digital offerings. By clarifying these boundaries, the ENCRYPT Act seeks to create a cohesive digital security framework across the nation, potentially influencing further legislative action in technology privacy and cybersecurity.

Lauded by civil liberties advocates, the bill is poised for discussion in both the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees, where it will undergo scrutiny and amendments before potentially reaching the floor for a vote.

The bill (H.R. 2508) introduced on 03/31/2025 has 1 co-sponsor: Rep. DelBene, Suzan K. [D-WA-1]...03/31/2025.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2509",40434,"Rep. Malliotakis Introduces COMPLETE Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-NY, has introduced the COMPLETE Care Act, aimed at enhancing behavioral health integration in primary care settings. The legislation proposes significant changes to the Social Security Act, offering financial incentives for healthcare providers to incorporate mental health services into their practices over the next several years.

The bill responds to growing concerns about the accessibility of mental health care and the need for integrated treatment models. With rising rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the COMPLETE Care Act seeks to bridge the gap between primary care and behavioral health services. By introducing payment incentives for these integrated services, the act encourages more healthcare professionals to adopt comprehensive care approaches that address both physical and mental health needs.

Under the proposed legislation, from 2027 to 2029, providers who incorporate behavioral health will receive increased reimbursement rates for specific services, with payments scaling down from 175% to 125% of the standard rates over the three years. Moreover, the bill allows for a waiver of the typical budget neutrality requirement, facilitating these changes without detrimental financial impacts on the broader Medicare system.

In addition to financial incentives, the COMPLETE Care Act mandates the provision of technical assistance to primary care practices to help them implement the needed behavioral health integration models effectively. This includes recognized approaches like the Collaborative Care Model, which has proven successful in improving outcomes for patients with mental health conditions.

As healthcare systems increasingly recognize the importance of holistic treatment, Malliotakis' legislation reflects a proactive step toward creating a more accessible and effective healthcare landscape for all Americans, fostering a system that prioritizes mental health alongside physical well-being.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2486",40434,"Rep. Ansari Introduces Heating and Cooling Relief Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-AZ, has proposed the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, aimed at amending the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. This legislation seeks to significantly increase funding for heating and cooling assistance, thereby easing the financial burden on low-income households struggling to afford energy costs.

The bill addresses the critical issue of energy affordability, particularly for low-income families who often pay up to three times more of their income on energy bills compared to their higher-income counterparts. Current data shows that approximately 54% of families earning under $35,000 have had to forgo basic needs like food and medicine to meet their energy expenses at least once in the past year. This alarming trend highlights the urgent need to bolster assistance programs to prevent utility shutoffs and promote energy affordability.

With climate change leading to more extreme weather patterns, including intense heat and cold, the bill aims to enhance the capacity of federal programs to aid households experiencing high energy burdens. In 2023, a mere 3% of eligible households received cooling assistance, prompting the need for systemic reforms to increase accessibility and responsiveness of support initiatives.

The Heating and Cooling Relief Act proposes essential changes, including revising income eligibility thresholds and streamlining application processes to minimize administrative burdens. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of collaboration among various government agencies to ensure that all eligible families receive necessary assistance without delay.

By expanding the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the act aims to not only alleviate immediate energy costs for vulnerable families but also to implement preventive measures to address the long-term impacts of climate change, thereby promoting sustainable and equitable access to energy for all.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2452",40434,"Rep. Miller Introduces Keep Our Girls Safe Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mary E. Miller, R-IL, has introduced the Keep Our Girls Safe Act, which aims to redefine policies on locker room access in educational institutions. The bill stipulates that locker rooms can only be used by individuals whose sex is determined solely by their reproductive biology and genetics at birth, impacting compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

The legislation has emerged amid ongoing debates surrounding biological sex versus gender identity within educational contexts. Supporters argue that it is essential to maintain single-sex spaces, such as locker rooms, to ensure safety and privacy, particularly for female students. Additionally, advocates assert that the bill promotes fairness in sports and educational activities where advantages based on gender identity could cause disparities.

Should this bill become law, it could redefine how educational institutions approach gender accommodation, potentially leading to significant changes in student locker room usage policies. Its effects may extend beyond locker rooms, influencing participation in sports and other school activities. Critics, however, worry this measure could roll back existing protections that allow transgender students to express their identities in school environments, possibly leading to increased discrimination and mental health issues among these students.

The Keep Our Girls Safe Act reflects a broader national conversation about gender rights and the implications these laws have for various demographics within educational systems. Introduced on March 27, 2025, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further evaluation. This legislative action adds to the ongoing discourse about balancing rights and protections across gender identities within schools.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2490",40434,"Rep. Burchett Introduces No In-State Tuition for Illegal Immigrants Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Burchett, R-TN, has introduced the “No In-State Tuition for Illegal Immigrants Act,” aiming to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. This legislation seeks to prohibit states from offering in-state tuition rates to non-citizens who are not lawfully present in the United States, contingent on their eligibility for federal educational funds.

The bill has arisen in a contentious climate regarding immigration policy, as debates surrounding educational access and state responsibilities intensify. Burchett’s initiative reflects a growing concern among some lawmakers who argue that in-state tuition benefits for undocumented immigrants could undermine educational opportunities for legal residents and citizens by diverting state resources.

Under the proposed legislation, states would no longer be able to access federal financial assistance for education if they continue to charge in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants. This could significantly impact state budgets, particularly in areas where undocumented students have been eligible for in-state tuition. States like California and Texas, which have implemented policies allowing this practice, may need to revise their educational funding frameworks to comply with federal requirements.

The bill has been referred to both the Judiciary and Education and Workforce committees for consideration, signaling its potential to spark nationwide discussions on immigration policy and states’ rights. Burchett's legislation, if passed, could set a precedent for how states manage educational costs related to undocumented students and may lead states to reconsider their current tuition structures. As higher education funding channels become intertwined with immigration status, this bill may shape the future landscape of tuition policy across the nation.

The bill (H.R. 2490) was introduced on 03/31/2025.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2489",40434,"Rep. Brown Introduces Hunger-Free Future Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-OH, has introduced the Hunger-Free Future Act to safeguard food security for vulnerable populations by prohibiting any updates from the Secretary of Agriculture that could increase food insecurity. The bill aims to ensure that revisions to the Thrifty Food Plan under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 do not lead to decreased access to adequate nutrition.

The Hunger-Free Future Act comes as many Americans experience rising food prices and economic instability. Proponents of the bill argue that updates to the Thrifty Food Plan must prioritize preventing hunger rather than adjusting expectations about the cost of living without adequate adjustments for those in need. By codifying the statement that no revisions should contribute to food insecurity, this legislation underscores a commitment to maintaining essential support structures for those relying on aid.

The bill's potential impact is substantial, as it addresses the underlying issues of food access amid increasing economic pressures. In recent months, families dependent on nutrition assistance programs have faced spikes in food costs, which have made it increasingly difficult for them to obtain necessary nourishment. This act seeks to counterbalance those challenges and ensure that future evaluations remain sensitive to the needs of low-income households.

With strong bipartisan sponsorship, the bill aims to move quickly through the legislative process. The introduction reflects a growing recognition among lawmakers of the urgent need for protective measures against food insecurity amidst compounding financial strains across the nation. As the bill heads to the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Brown emphasizes that safeguarding food access is crucial for the well-being of millions of Americans.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ami Bera, D-CA, has introduced a bill to officially designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 3817 Marysville Boulevard in Sacramento, California, as the “Grantland Johnson Post Office.” This bill aims to honor the legacy of Grantland Johnson, a prominent local leader and civil rights advocate.

The initiative to rename the post office reflects growing recognition of Johnson’s significant contributions to the Sacramento community and his work promoting healthcare access and social justice. By memorializing his name on such a vital public facility, supporters hope to inspire future generations to emulate Johnson’s commitment to community service and civic engagement.

This proposal is not just a symbolic gesture; it also serves to strengthen community ties. Local residents and civic leaders have long advocated for recognition of Johnson's efforts, citing his impactful leadership during vital local initiatives, particularly in education and public health sectors. Designating the post office in his honor can foster a sense of pride and belonging among residents and highlight the values of commitment and service.

The bill is currently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it will be deliberated further. If approved, this homage would ensure that Grantland Johnson's name and legacy live on, making it a point of reference for all who visit or pass by the post office. Renaming public facilities after influential figures is a tradition that celebrates local history while providing communities with greatly needed symbols of hope and progress.

Procurement of additional support from local leaders and citizens will be crucial for the passage of this bill, affirming that a community's values can be effectively represented through public service landmarks.

The bill (H.R. 2488) was introduced on 03/31/2025.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2487",40434,"Rep. Balint Introduces Transgender Health Care Access Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Becca Balint, D-VT, has introduced the Transgender Health Care Access Act, a legislative proposal aimed at improving access to critical, evidence-based health care services for transgender individuals. The bill was presented to Congress on March 31, 2025, and focuses on addressing significant gaps in the availability and delivery of gender-affirming care.

The introduction of this bill is a response to the urgent need for enhanced health care services for transgender individuals, whose medical needs have historically been underserved. Research has shown that access to appropriate health care is crucial for improving the mental and physical well-being of transgender people, decreasing rates of depression and suicide, and enhancing overall quality of life.

The Transgender Health Care Access Act outlines specific initiatives, including funding for the development of medical education curricula focused on gender-affirming care, creating training programs for health care providers, and expanding capacity at community health centers. These measures aim to increase the number of competent professionals available to provide affirmative care while addressing the education gap that currently exists within medical training.

With an emphasis on community efforts, the bill calls for grants to be allocated to health centers that serve transgender populations, particularly those in rural areas. By fostering collaboration and encouraging culturally competent care, the legislation seeks to cultivate a health care environment where transgender individuals receive the respectful and effective services they deserve.

The introduction of this bill has garnered support from a range of congressional representatives, with a growing call for the expansion of transgender health rights and access. As discussions continue, proponents hope the measure will receive swift consideration in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it has been referred for further evaluation.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2485",40434,"Rep. Bonamici Introduces Arts Education for All Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-OR, has introduced the Arts Education for All Act, a legislative effort aimed at significantly expanding arts education across the United States. This bill seeks to integrate arts education more deeply into K-12 curricula, enhance resources for early childhood education, and improve access for underserved communities.

The impetus for this bill stems from growing concerns over the declining presence of arts education in schools, which many educators argue is critical for fostering creativity and improving student engagement. By elevating the importance of arts in education, the legislation aims to ensure that students receive a well-rounded educational experience that includes exposure to music, visual arts, and theater. One of the key components of the legislation is its focus on training and professional development for arts educators, which will help address the shortage of qualified arts teachers in many schools.

Supporters of the Arts Education for All Act believe it will have a transformative impact on student achievement. Research indicates that incorporating arts education into the standard curriculum can lead to improved performance in core subjects like math and reading. Furthermore, enhancing access to arts programs is expected to support the development of vital skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, and innovation among students, particularly those from low-income and marginalized backgrounds.

The legislation promises to allocate resources specifically for arts programs, ensuring that schools can offer diverse creative experiences. By integrating arts education into existing educational frameworks, the Act intends to create more holistic learning environments that cater to diverse learning styles and interests, ultimately preparing students for success in an increasingly complex world.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2484",40434,"Rep. Harshbarger Introduces Seniors’ Access to Critical Medications Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-TN, has introduced the Seniors’ Access to Critical Medications Act aimed at amending Medicare regulations to improve access to essential outpatient prescription drugs for seniors. This legislation creates new pathways for certain drugs to be prescribed and dispensed directly by physicians within their practices, enhancing medication accessibility for Medicare beneficiaries.

The bill arises from ongoing challenges faced by seniors in accessing timely medications through traditional pharmacy routes. Many seniors struggle to navigate complex healthcare systems, leading to delays in treatment and adherence to prescribed therapies. By allowing outpatient prescription drugs to be dispensed directly in physician office settings, the act seeks to streamline access, ensuring that patients receive necessary care without unnecessary obstacles.

Under the proposed legislation, outpatient drugs will only be dispensed if specific criteria are met, such as having a prior in-person consultation with the prescribing physician. This stipulation aims to ensure continuity of care while also mitigating potential conflicts of interest by emphasizing a strong patient-physician relationship. Additionally, a study mandated by the bill will analyze how these changes affect medication dispensing patterns and potentially highlight areas for further reform.

This legislation aligns with broader health policy goals of reducing barriers for seniors in accessing medications and managing chronic diseases effectively. By introducing the Seniors’ Access to Critical Medications Act, Harshbarger hopes to facilitate better health outcomes for millions of seniors reliant on Medicare, while also addressing the need for efficient healthcare delivery mechanisms within the current system. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-KY, has introduced the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025, a crucial legislative effort aimed at addressing opioid use disorder through prevention, treatment, and recovery initiatives. This comprehensive bill seeks to reauthorize existing programs and enhance funding to support struggling communities impacted by the ongoing opioid crisis.

The bill is designed to build on previous efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, which has devastated countless families and communities across the United States. Tragic statistics reveal that opioid-related overdoses have surged in recent years, prompting lawmakers to call for more robust measures to address prevention and treatment. With this legislation, Rep. Guthrie aims to provide resources for innovative programs, fostering a multi-faceted approach to combatting substance use disorders.

Key elements in the bill include provisions for prenatal and postnatal health programs, improvements in the accessibility of addiction treatment services, and comprehensive community support initiatives. The reauthorization will also establish funding mechanisms for state and tribal responses to opioid-related issues, equipping local authorities with necessary resources to tackle the crisis effectively.

Furthermore, the act promotes enhanced training for first responders and healthcare providers, ensuring they are well-prepared to address the complexities of substance use disorders. By fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, the legislation aims to create a sustainable framework for recovery that benefits individuals and families.

The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025, referred to multiple committees including Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce, represents a critical step forward in addressing America’s opioid epidemic. If passed, it promises to improve access to necessary services and ultimately reduce the toll of addiction on communities nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robert E. Latta, R-OH, has introduced the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Reauthorization Act of 2025, aimed at renewing the operational framework of the NTIA for the upcoming fiscal years. The bill seeks to address funding increases and structural changes to enhance the agency's capacity in the ever-evolving telecommunications sector.

The primary motivation for the bill is to bolster the NTIA's appropriations, proposing a budget of $57 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, a significant increase from the previous funding levels established in 1992. This reauthorization is crucial for ensuring the NTIA continues to fulfil its mandate regarding telecommunications policy and administration effectively. 

By establishing the Office of Spectrum Management and the Office of International Affairs within the NTIA, the bill aims to improve coordination and efficiency in handling spectrum management and international telecommunications issues. This move reflects a growing recognition of the importance of a robust telecommunications infrastructure, especially as the U.S. navigates global competition in technology and communications.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant for both the public and private sectors. It addresses not only the technical aspects of telecommunications but also aims to promote innovation and economic growth through enhanced regulatory practices. The bill's provisions are designed to facilitate better oversight of emerging technologies, ensuring that the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in the digital landscape.

As the bill progresses through Congress, it has garnered attention for its comprehensive restructuring of the NTIA, illustrating a commitment to adapt to the dynamic communications environment and serve the needs of all citizens effectively.

"$H billintroh-250331-hr2481",40434,"Rep. Valadao Introduces Romance Scam Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David G. Valadao, R-CA, recently introduced the Romance Scam Prevention Act aimed at enhancing protections for users of online dating platforms. The bill mandates that online dating service providers notify their members if they receive messages from accounts that have been banned due to fraudulent activities.

The Act was prompted by rising incidents of romance scams, where individuals are deceived into sending money or personal information to fraudulent accounts. According to a recent report, such scams have caused millions in losses and have left victims emotionally and financially devastated. The proposal seeks to create a structured notification system, requiring dating services to inform users of banned members within 24 hours, including specific information about the banned account and advice on how to protect themselves from fraud.

In addition to immediate user notifications, the bill emphasizes the need for online dating platforms to provide clear, actionable guidance on avoiding online scams. This includes strategies for identifying potential fraudsters and instructions for reporting suspicious behavior.

The enforcement of this legislation would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which could take action against violators. States would also have the right to intervene if they believe local residents' interests are being compromised. Critics express concern about the feasibility of implementing these requirements across various platforms, especially smaller dating services that may lack resources.

As online dating systems become more integrated into people’s social lives, Valadao’s bill highlights the necessity to safeguard users against fraud, ensuring a safer online experience in the ever-evolving digital landscape. The Romance Scam Prevention Act is now under review by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, with discussions expected in the coming weeks.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Greg Landsman, D-OH, has introduced the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act to bolster the United States' semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. The bill, introduced on March 31, 2025, aims to enhance foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related production by coordinating federal efforts with state-level economic development organizations.

The legislation comes in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Semiconductors are crucial for various sectors, from manufacturing to national defense, and ensuring an uninterrupted supply is integral for economic stability. By boosting local production and investment, the U.S. seeks to mitigate risks associated with global supply chain reliance.

Under the proposed act, SelectUSA, a program under the Department of Commerce, will be tasked with collaborating with state organizations to identify barriers that hinder foreign investments in semiconductor manufacturing. This collaboration is anticipated to not only streamline investment processes but also create a more resilient semiconductor supply chain. The bill further stipulates that SelectUSA will report on its findings within two years, assessing strategies to enhance investment and secure the semiconductor supply chain.

This initiative aligns with broader efforts to reinforce American manufacturing amidst shifting global dynamics. As countries worldwide pivot to strengthen their technological infrastructure, the U.S. aims to leverage its existing technological prowess by attracting investments that bolster its semiconductor production capabilities. By doing so, the legislation underscores a commitment to economic and national security in an increasingly complex global landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-NJ, has introduced the Homes for Young Adults Act, aimed at providing housing assistance to youth and young adults experiencing homelessness. The proposed legislation amends the United States Housing Act of 1937, creating an entitlement program for rental assistance targeting individuals aged 18 to 30 who are unstably housed.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to a growing crisis, with an estimated 4.2 million young individuals facing homelessness annually in the United States. Research highlights that access to housing resources is disproportionately limited for youth of color and LGBTQ+ youth, further compounding systemic barriers. The act's proponents argue that it could significantly reduce poverty, improve overall well-being, and facilitate better outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Central to the initiative is the provision of housing choice vouchers that would help eligible youth and young adults secure stable housing. The bill seeks to eliminate extensive eligibility requirements that currently hinder access to the housing choice voucher program, which only serves about a quarter of eligible households due to funding and bureaucratic constraints. Furthermore, the legislation highlights the need for support services, including job training and safe housing navigation, ensuring that recipients not only acquire housing but also thrive in their new environments.

The Homes for Young Adults Act also emphasizes interagency cooperation among federal bodies, like the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Education, to foster a more integrated approach in combating youth homelessness. As the bill proceeds to the Committee on Financial Services, advocates are hopeful that it will gain traction to help stabilize housing for many at-risk young people in the nation.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2478",40434,"Rep. Wagner Introduces Financial Exploitation Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ann Wagner, R-MO, has introduced the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2025, aiming to enhance protections for vulnerable adults against financial exploitation in the investment sector. The bill seeks to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing for the postponement of security redemptions if there are reasonable grounds to suspect exploitation.

The legislation responds to an alarming increase in financial exploitation cases targeting older adults and individuals with disabilities. By enabling investment companies to delay redemption payments, the bill provides a safeguard against immediate financial loss that could occur due to fraudulent activities. This approach is particularly crucial in a landscape where financial scams are increasingly sophisticated, putting at risk the life savings of those least able to defend themselves.

If passed, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act would require registered investment firms to implement new procedures for identifying and reporting potential exploitation cases. These firms would also have to document and retain records related to any delays in redemption payments. The bill emphasizes accountability by mandating that companies inform designated contacts (provided by the investor) of any concerns regarding exploitation.

Wagner's initiative is supported by various stakeholders in the financial and elder law sectors, who advocate for stronger measures to protect at-risk individuals. With an ageing population, experts highlight the importance of legislative action to create robust frameworks that deter exploitation and support the financial well-being of vulnerable citizens.

The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on Financial Services, where its provisions will be examined further before potential consideration by the full House. This act represents a significant step toward securing the financial future of America's older and at-risk populations.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2477",40434,"Rep. Van Duyne Introduces Portable Ultrasound Reimbursement Equity Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-TX, has introduced the Portable Ultrasound Reimbursement Equity Act of 2025, aimed at expanding Medicare coverage to include portable ultrasound transportation and setup services. The bill seeks to ensure that patients have better access to essential diagnostic services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

The need for this legislation arises from the growing recognition of the importance of portable ultrasound technology in medical diagnosis and treatment. Currently, Medicare offers limited reimbursement for portable ultrasound services, creating disparities in access compared to other diagnostic services such as portable X-rays. By amending the Social Security Act, the bill aims to provide equitable payment structures for ultrasound services and promote their adoption among healthcare providers.

This legislation is poised to significantly impact patient care. By facilitating access to portable ultrasound technology, it can enhance early diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions, particularly in populations lacking immediate access to traditional imaging facilities. In addition, providing reimbursement for these services will encourage healthcare providers to invest in and utilize portable ultrasound equipment, which can be particularly beneficial in emergency and outpatient settings.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jill Tokuda, D-HI, has introduced the Stop Illegal Campaign Coordination Act, aiming to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The bill seeks to clarify the conditions under which campaign expenditures are considered coordinated with a candidate or a political party, addressing concerns about the flow of money in political campaigns.

The introduction of this legislation is driven by increasing scrutiny over campaign financing and the potential for illegal coordination between candidates and independent expenditure committees. This bill aims to ensure that any expenditures made are transparently linked to specific directions or guidance from candidates or their authorized committees, thereby safeguarding electoral integrity.

Under the proposed legislation, expenditures will be deemed coordinated if they reflect instructions or suggestions from a candidate, an authorized committee, or a political party. This shift is intended to close loopholes that have allowed for circumvention of existing campaign finance laws, particularly regarding independent expenditures that influence elections without direct candidate involvement.

Potential impacts of the Stop Illegal Campaign Coordination Act are significant. By tightening the regulations around campaign finance structures, the bill aims to curb the influence of dark money in American elections. Advocates argue that clearer guidelines will promote transparency and accountability, fostering a fairer electoral process. Critics, however, may argue that additional regulations could hinder the ability of independent organizations to participate in the electoral process.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on House Administration for further consideration. As it progresses, it will likely spark debates on the balance between free speech in campaigning and the need for transparency in political financing.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the No Sanctions Relief for Terrorists Act, aimed at tightening U.S. sanctions against Iran by prohibiting waivers or licenses for transactions involving individuals and entities linked to terrorism.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bradley Scott Schneider (D-IL), has introduced the Repealing Outdated and Unilateral Tariff Authorities Act, a legislative effort aimed at eliminating an antiquated provision from the Tariff Act of 1930. This bill seeks to repeal Section 338, which grants outdated tariff authorities that many argue are no longer applicable in today’s global trade environment.

The introduction of this bill comes as part of a broader effort to modernize U.S. trade laws, improving their relevance and effectiveness in the current economic landscape. Lawmakers have pointed out that retaining such outdated measures can stifle business growth and hinder the U.S. economy's ability to adapt to changing global market conditions.

Repealing this outdated tariff authority is expected to streamline regulatory processes and enhance trade relations, fostering a more competitive U.S. market. The legislation is anticipated to benefit both importers and consumers, potentially leading to lower prices on goods and enhanced availability in the marketplace.

The Tariff Act of 1930 was originally designed to protect U.S. industries during a time of economic uncertainty, but critics argue that the provisions associated with Section 338 have long outlived their usefulness. By revoking these unilateral tariff powers, supporters of the bill envision a reinvigorated approach to U.S. trade policy that prioritizes cooperation rather than isolation.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it will be subject to scrutiny by the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it will undergo further debate and consideration. If passed, the repeal could mark a pivotal shift in how the United States navigates its economic relationships on the global stage.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2462",40434,"Rep. Rose Introduces Black Vulture Relief Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John W. Rose, R-TN, has introduced the Black Vulture Relief Act to authorize livestock producers to manage black vulture populations that pose a threat to their animals. The bill aims to equip farmers with the legal means to take action against these birds to prevent potential harm to their livestock.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing concerns among livestock producers about the rising black vulture population, which has been linked to livestock fatalities due to predation. Reports have indicated that these birds can inflict serious harm, leading to livestock deaths and significant financial losses for farmers.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-CO, has introduced the Manufactured Housing Tenant's Bill of Rights Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing tenant protections in manufactured home communities. This legislation seeks to ensure that federally backed financing is only available to communities that implement minimum consumer protections in rental agreements.

The bill arises in response to growing concerns about the rights of residents in manufactured housing parks, particularly amid rising rents and questionable management practices. By mandating that operators of manufactured home communities include protections such as one-year lease terms and justified rent increases, the legislation addresses the vulnerabilities faced by tenants. 

If enacted, the bill will require communities to provide tenants with written notice of any rent increases at least 60 days in advance, thereby fostering transparency and accountability. Additional protections include a grace period for rent payments and a tenant's right to sell their manufactured home without unnecessary relocation. Importantly, these measures aim to diminish the risk of exploitation by landlord practices that could lead to sudden financial strain for residents.

As the manufactured housing sector plays a crucial role in affordable housing, the bill is also expected to impact how financing decisions are made. Communities failing to comply with the outlined protections could lose access to critical funding, which may incentivize them to prioritize tenant rights.

The legislation has garnered support from various advocates who recognize the need for stronger regulations in this sector, emphasizing that the absence of a formal framework has left many residents unprotected.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-CA, has introduced the Reclaim Trade Powers Act, a legislative initiative aimed at amending the Trade Act of 1974 to eliminate the authority to impose specific import surcharges designed to address balance of payments deficits. This bill was formally introduced on March 27, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

The Reclaim Trade Powers Act reflects growing concerns among lawmakers that existing trade mechanisms may inhibit economic recovery and exacerbate international relations. By abolishing the authority to impose import surcharges, the legislation seeks to promote more equitable trade practices and provide relief for American consumers and businesses facing inflationary pressures due to higher import costs. Advocates argue that the current approach may inadvertently hinder economic growth and competition, especially with suppliers from countries that do not impose similar taxes.

The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of the United States' trade policies and a push for a more proactive stance in international markets. The bill is seen as an effort to empower Congress with broader oversight over trade measures, fostering greater accountability in how trade-related decisions impact American workers. 

Moreover, this act aligns with a broader trend in Congress to reassess trade strategies in light of evolving global economic dynamics. As discussions around trade continue to intensify, the Reclaim Trade Powers Act embodies a significant shift towards prioritizing domestic economic stability and promoting favorable trading conditions. 

If passed, the legislation could reshape how the U.S. interacts with international trade partners and potentially lead to decreased prices for consumers as imposed surcharges are eliminated, thereby ensuring that American businesses remain competitive in a global marketplace.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nathaniel Moran, R-TX, has introduced the Orderly Liquidation of the Department of Education Act, a bill aimed at terminating the federal education agency and shifting its responsibilities back to individual states and local communities. The bill is seen as a response to ongoing debates about the effectiveness of the Department of Education since its establishment 45 years ago.

The proposed legislation argues that the Department of Education has not significantly improved educational outcomes and has often imposed federal regulations that hinder local decision-making. By dissolving the federal agency, the bill's supporters contend that education policy can be more effectively managed at the state and local level, enabling schools to address unique community needs without federal interference.

If enacted, the act would detail a gradual dissolution process, giving the government until October 1, 2026, to wind down operations. Key functions of the Department of Education would be transferred to other federal entities, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, to maintain certain educational standards and civil rights protections. This restructuring aims to preserve essential services while allowing for more localized governance.

Critics of the bill warn that dismantling the federal oversight of education could lead to disparities in educational quality and accessibility across states. They argue that the centralized support provided by the Department of Education has been vital in addressing issues like special education, civil rights, and equitable access to resources for underprivileged students.

With the introduction of this bill, Moran hopes to ignite a comprehensive discussion about the future of education governance in the United States. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dave Min, D-CA, has introduced the Special Government Employees Transparency Act aimed at enhancing accountability and transparency within federal agencies that utilize special government employees. This legislation, presented on March 27, 2025, mandates a 130-day annual limit for the service of such employees, along with the establishment of a public database containing their financial disclosures and employment details.

The introduction of this bill arises from growing concerns regarding the oversight of special government employees, who often serve on a temporary basis. By capping their service time, the bill seeks to prevent potential misuse of these positions and to ensure that they are subject to the same scrutiny as full-time government employees. This measure is expected to streamline accountability across agencies while promoting public trust in governmental operations.

The proposed legislation includes provisions for creating a searchable database, enabling the public to access crucial information about these employees, such as their names, job titles, pay rates, and the relevant agencies they serve. This transparency aims to foster a culture of openness and ensure that individuals are held accountable for their actions in public service roles.

In addition to the database, the bill also requires federal agencies to publish financial disclosure reports of special government employees to guarantee that potential conflicts of interest are disclosed. This aligns with broader efforts to bolster the integrity of government operations and to maintain the public's confidence in their institutions.

As the bill is referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, supporters argue that these reforms are essential for promoting accountability and ethical conduct among temporary government personnel. If passed, the Special Government Employees Transparency Act could serve as a landmark change in how special government roles are regulated and monitored.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Cory Mills, R-FL, has introduced the No Citizenship for Alien Invaders Act of 2025, aimed at amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to block naturalization for individuals who have unlawfully entered the United States. The proposal asserts that immigration policy must prioritize legal entry and uphold national security and sovereignty.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-IA, has introduced a bill aimed at continuing Executive Order 14224 indefinitely. This legislation seeks to designate English as the official language of the United States, following the Executive Order's implementation on March 1, 2025. 

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when discussions surrounding the role of language in American identity and governance are increasingly relevant. Proponents argue that establishing an official language can enhance national unity and streamline government operations. By maintaining English as the official language, the bill aims to clarify the language used in government documents and official communications.

Language policies are often entwined with issues of cultural identity and social integration, giving rise to debates about the inclusivity of non-English speakers. Critics of such measures often point to the need for a more diverse linguistic policy that reflects the country's multicultural makeup. 

The bill has been referred to both the House Education and Workforce Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for further examination. The ongoing discussion highlights the complexities of language in public policy, as lawmakers seek to balance between establishing an official standard and recognizing the diverse linguistic landscape of the American populace.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eric Burlison, R-MO, has introduced the Guidance Clarity Act aimed at improving transparency and understanding around agency guidance documents. This legislative measure mandates federal agencies to include a guidance clarity statement in each guidance document they issue. The proposed statement will clarify that the guidance does not hold the force of law and is only meant to provide public clarity regarding existing laws or agency policies.

The bill was born out of concerns relating to the complexities and ambiguities that often accompany federal agency guidance. Stakeholders, including businesses and legal experts, have expressed frustration over the unclear nature of some agency communications, which can lead to confusion and compliance challenges. By implementing this guidance clarity statement, the legislation seeks to empower citizens and organizations with a clearer understanding of their obligations under federal law.

The implications of this bill are significant. If passed, it would standardize how agencies communicate their guidance, allowing for a more uniform approach across various sectors. Additionally, the guidance clarity statement, prominently displayed at the front of each document, could reduce compliance errors and improve interactions between the public and the government.

As part of the legislative process, the bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2413",40434,"Rep. Casten Introduces GREEN Appraisals Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the GREEN Appraisals Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing the accuracy of energy appraisals in residential mortgage loans. The bill seeks to ensure that factors such as energy efficiency and renewable energy features are taken into account during the home appraisal process.

The legislative move is spurred by a growing recognition of the importance of energy efficiency in housing, especially as consumers increasingly seek sustainable living solutions. The current appraisal process often overlooks the energy characteristics of properties, which can undervalue homes with energy-efficient features. This gap can hinder homeowners from realizing the full value of their investments in energy-efficient upgrades and can limit their ability to secure favorable mortgage terms.

Under the proposed bill, borrowers will be informed of their rights to provide energy reports during loan applications. Qualified appraisers will be required to consider these reports, aiding in establishing a property’s market value appropriately. This approach will encourage lenders to better understand the financial implications of energy efficiency, potentially leading to more favorable lending practices for energy-efficient homes.

The GREEN Appraisals Act also mandates that starting March 2026, creditors must provide appraisers with energy reports upon the borrower’s consent. This provision is expected to create a more transparent and informed appraisal process. With appraisers now required to factor in energy characteristics, the bill aims to improve the market competitiveness of homes with sustainable features.

The bill has been referred to both the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for further consideration, signaling its alignment with efforts to enhance affordable housing and promote renewable energy initiatives.

The bill (H.R. 2413) was introduced on 03/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2414",40434,"Rep. Castor Introduces Trauma Readiness Grant Program","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kathy Castor, D-FL, has introduced a bill aimed at reauthorizing a critical partnership between military and civilian entities to enhance trauma readiness across the United States. The proposed legislation modifies the Public Health Service Act by continuing funding for a grant program that plays a vital role in preparing healthcare providers for responding to traumatic incidents.

This initiative was spurred by the increasing need for enhanced trauma care capabilities, particularly in emergency situations such as natural disasters or large-scale accidents. By reauthorizing the program for the fiscal years 2025 to 2029, the bill seeks to ensure that healthcare professionals have the necessary training and resources to effectively treat trauma victims. This is crucial not only for improving patient outcomes but also for bolstering national readiness in the face of emergencies.

The trauma readiness grant program fosters collaboration between military medical teams and civilian healthcare systems, allowing the sharing of best practices, training resources, and innovative techniques. This partnership not only strengthens civilian healthcare operations but also enhances the military’s ability to provide trauma care in various scenarios, both domestically and internationally.

As the healthcare landscape evolves, the importance of preparedness cannot be understated. By supporting this program, Rep. Castor aims to equip communities with the skills and knowledge needed to manage challenges related to trauma care, thereby improving overall public health resilience. The bill was introduced in the House on March 27, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further deliberation.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2415",40434,"Rep. Cohen Introduces Baseball Diplomacy Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the Baseball Diplomacy Act, a new bill aimed at easing restrictions on Cuban nationals traveling to the United States to play organized professional baseball. The legislation seeks to create a more welcoming environment for Cuban athletes by allowing them to enter the U.S. on specific visas without fear of legal repercussions related to existing trade restrictions.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns about the barriers faced by Cuban baseball players who wish to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). Currently, strict immigration policies and trade embargo laws complicate their ability to join American teams. By waiving certain prohibitions on transactions with Cuba, the act aims to streamline the process for these players, ensuring that they can live and work in the U.S. during the baseball season.

If passed, the Baseball Diplomacy Act would permit Cuban players to return home with their earnings and would not require them to renew their visas as long as they hold valid contracts with American teams. This provision is designed to facilitate a smoother transition for Cuban players, who often encounter challenges navigating U.S. immigration rules despite their talents.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader movement to improve relations between the U.S. and Cuba, particularly in the realm of sports. Cuban athletes have a rich history in baseball, and the act could significantly impact the industry by enriching the talent pool and fostering goodwill between the two nations.

Rep. Cohen's legislation has been referred to the House Committees on Foreign Affairs and Judiciary, where it will be reviewed before any further action is taken. The outcome of this bill could reshape the landscape of professional baseball and highlight the cultural exchange that sports can facilitate.

The bill (H.R. 2415) was introduced on 03/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2417",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act, a bill aimed at enhancing the management, visibility, and accountability of software assets within federal agencies. The legislation seeks to address inefficiencies in current software practices, ensuring proper oversight and streamlined management of software entitlements.

The act emerges in response to concerns over the lack of comprehensive tracking and management of software across various agencies. With federal spending on software increasing, the bill aims to consolidate software entitlements, which can lead to reduced costs and improved performance. By mandating that each agency undergo a thorough assessment of its software assets, the bill intends to identify redundancies and enhance interoperability among software systems.

Key provisions of the legislation require agencies to develop a detailed comprehensive assessment that outlines their current software inventory, including costs associated with cloud services and contractual agreements. This assessment will guide agencies in creating plans to consolidate software entitlements, thus eliminating unnecessary spend while maximizing software utility. The Chief Information Officers within each agency are tasked with overseeing this process, collaborating closely with financial and data officers.

In addition, the bill emphasizes the necessity of training agency personnel on efficient software acquisition and management practices. This includes understanding licensing agreements and the implications of cloud service usage. By improving the training and oversight of software asset management, the legislation aims to foster a more accountable and cost-effective approach to technology use within the federal government.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further deliberation and refinement. If passed, it could significantly reshape how federal agencies manage their software resources, ultimately leading to better governance and cost efficiency in taxpayer-funded programs.

The bill (H.R. 2417) introduced on 03/27/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Rep. Fallon, Pat [R-TX-4]...03/27/2025; Rep. McClain Delaney, April [D-MD-6]...03/27/2025; Rep. Mace, Nancy [R-SC-1]...03/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2418",40434,"Rep. Davidson Introduces Federal Reserve Regulatory Oversight Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, has introduced the Federal Reserve Regulatory Oversight Act, a legislative proposal aimed at integrating specific functions of the Federal Reserve into the annual congressional appropriations process. This bill seeks to enhance oversight and transparency regarding the non-monetary policy administrative costs of the Federal Reserve System.

The act was introduced against a backdrop of increasing calls for accountability in monetary policy institutions. Historically, many operational costs incurred by the Federal Reserve have been managed independently, leading to concerns about unchecked spending and the lack of robust congressional oversight. By subjecting these costs to the appropriations process, the bill intends to ensure that taxpayers have a clearer view of how funds are being utilized within the Federal Reserve, particularly in administrative operations that are not directly linked to monetary policy.

Should the Federal Reserve Regulatory Oversight Act pass, the implications could be significant. It mandates that the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve banks collect fees and assessments to offset their administrative costs, ensuring these expenses are directly aligned with congressional approval. The act would limit the board’s ability to allocate resources without prior approval, fostering a culture of fiscal responsibility and oversight.

The legislation introduces a framework that only applies to non-monetary policy-related costs, preserving the Federal Reserve's autonomy regarding its core monetary functions. With the potential to reshape the relationship between Congress and the Federal Reserve, this bill underscores a broader legislative focus on maintaining fiscal integrity and enhancing public trust in federal institutions. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2419",40434,"Rep. Davidson Introduces Patient Fairness Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, recently introduced the Patient Fairness Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at broadening access to health savings accounts (HSAs) for all individuals, removing eligibility restrictions that previously limited contributions based on health insurance enrollment.

The Patient Fairness Act proposes crucial amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, chiefly eliminating limitations on who can contribute to HSAs. Under current law, only individuals with high-deductible health plans are eligible to make contributions. This bill would enable all individuals to deduct contributions, thereby allowing greater flexibility for managing healthcare expenses.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns over health care costs and access to necessary medical services. By enabling more Americans to contribute to HSAs, the legislation seeks to empower individuals in managing their healthcare expenditures more effectively, offering them the financial tools necessary to plan for future medical needs.

Moreover, the Patient Fairness Act proposes to increase annual contribution limits to HSAs—up to $8,000 for individuals and $16,000 for families—and incentivizes retirement savings by allowing additional contributions for individuals aged 55 and older. These changes are expected to encourage more Americans to invest in their health, particularly as medical expenses continue to rise.

Incorporating provisions from past regulatory frameworks, the bill also promises to enforce hospital price transparency standards, ensuring that patients have access to clear pricing information for healthcare services, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions.

Should it gain traction in Congress, the Patient Fairness Act could represent a significant step towards reforming healthcare financing in the United States, providing individuals with expanded options and greater financial autonomy regarding their health expenses.

The bill (H.R. 2419) was introduced on 03/27/2025.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2421",40434,"Rep. DelBene Introduces Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Suzan K. DelBene, D-WA, has introduced the Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act, aimed at preventing the imposition of certain functions from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) personnel without specific evaluations. The bill, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to protect taxpayer services by ensuring that IRS personnel are adequately trained before taking on additional responsibilities.

The rationale behind the Protecting Taxpayer Resources Act stems from growing concerns that integrating DHS functions could detract from the IRS's primary goal: to provide quality service to taxpayers. Advocates of the bill argue that imposing such tasks without proper training may hinder the IRS's effectiveness in helping taxpayers understand their tax obligations and enforcing tax laws fairly and consistently. 

If enacted, the bill will require the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to determine that IRS personnel have received appropriate training before any DHS functions can be assigned. This evaluation will also assess whether such changes would adversely affect the IRS's mission. The determination would be published in the Federal Register for transparency and can be withdrawn in a similar manner if needed.

This legislative move arrives amid a backdrop of recent discussions around the IRS's overwhelming responsibilities, especially in a time marked by increased tax scrutiny and administrative demands. Proponents of the bill believe it could streamline operations at the IRS and ensure that taxpayer services remain the agency’s top priority. As the bill awaits deliberation in the House Committee on Ways and Means, officials and stakeholders will monitor its progress closely, emphasizing the importance of maintaining taxpayer trust and service quality in federal tax administration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2422",40434,"Rep. Donalds Introduces CAPE Canaveral Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, has introduced the CAPE Canaveral Act, a legislative proposal that aims to transfer the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to Brevard County, Florida. The bill seeks to consolidate the agency's operations more closely with the Space Coast, which has long been a hub for aerospace and space exploration activities.

Motivations for the bill include promoting economic growth in the region and enhancing the capabilities of NASA by positioning it nearer to key launch facilities. Brevard County is home to prominent aerospace companies and offers extensive infrastructure, thereby positioning it as an optimal location for NASA's headquarters.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2423",40434,"Rep. Estes Introduces Unfair Tax Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced the Unfair Tax Prevention Act, aimed at modifying the application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax under the Internal Revenue Code. This legislation targets certain foreign-owned entities linked to jurisdictions imposing extraterritorial taxes, seeking to alleviate the tax burden these entities face.

The motivation behind the Unfair Tax Prevention Act stems from concerns that current U.S. tax laws inadvertently disadvantage American corporations engaged with foreign entities that are taxed by their governments on income sourced from the U.S. This situation can create inefficiencies and discourage cross-border trade. By adjusting the base erosion tax framework, the bill endeavors to level the playing field for U.S. businesses operating internationally, allowing for a more equitable competitive environment.

The proposed changes would treat specific foreign-owned extraterritorial tax regime entities similarly to domestic companies, allowing for greater tax benefits. Specifically, the bill aims to affect the calculations of corporate taxable income for entities facing foreign taxes, thereby reducing their overall tax liability. This move is projected to positively impact American businesses that collaborate with foreign partners, potentially facilitating increased investment and operational resilience across borders.

As tax regulations evolve to address global economic dynamics, the Unfair Tax Prevention Act reflects a significant adjustment aimed at maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. By addressing the complexities related to extraterritorial taxation, this bill signals responsiveness to the interconnected nature of modern commerce while safeguarding American interests in the global marketplace.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, with potential discussions anticipated in upcoming congressional sessions.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2426",40434,"Rep. Fallon Introduces Veterans Mental Health and Addiction Therapy Quality of Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pat Fallon, R-TX, has introduced the Veterans Mental Health and Addiction Therapy Quality of Care Act aimed at enhancing the quality of mental health and addiction therapy for veterans. The proposed bill mandates a comprehensive study comparing the care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA providers in various treatment modalities.

The bill seeks to address growing concerns about disparities in mental health and addiction treatment access and efficacy for veterans. In recent years, many veterans have reported inadequate services and lengthy waits for care through the VA, which has spurred calls for reform. The study stipulated within the bill will analyze treatment outcomes, evidence-based practices, and gaps in coordination between VA and non-VA providers. By doing so, lawmakers hope to identify best practices and improve care delivery for those who have served in the military.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant. With mental health issues and substance abuse becoming more prevalent among veterans, improved care could lead to better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and ultimately save lives. The study's results will be pivotal in informing future policies and initiatives aimed at providing veterans with the comprehensive, timely care they deserve.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, its passage could mark a critical step towards ensuring that veterans receive high-quality mental health and addiction treatment. Rep. Fallon’s initiative reflects a commitment to addressing the urgent needs of veterans, particularly as they navigate the complexities of mental health challenges and addiction. If enacted, the findings will be published publicly, promoting transparency and accountability within the VA system.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Laura Friedman, D-CA, has introduced the Wildfire Homeowner Relief Act, a legislative measure aimed at exploring a federal buyout program for homeowners located in high-risk wildfire disaster areas. The bill directs the Comptroller General to conduct a comprehensive study on the feasibility and structure of such a program, which would facilitate voluntary property sales before and after catastrophic wildfire events.

The introduction of this bill comes in the wake of increasing wildfire incidences, particularly in California, where homeowners are facing profound risks to their properties and livelihoods. The legislation aims to address these challenges by examining how federal grant programs could be leveraged to assist homeowners by purchasing their properties at-risk.

The proposed study seeks to evaluate existing buyout programs and offer recommendations on developing a robust national database that catalogs these efforts. This initiative would not only assist in creating a framework for future buyouts but also aim to streamline communication between key federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

If the Wildfire Homeowner Relief Act is enacted, it has the potential to significantly reduce the economic and emotional toll associated with wildfires by providing homeowners with a viable exit strategy while also considering long-term land use strategies post-buyout. The findings from this study will be critical in shaping federal policy and disaster readiness in response to the increasing severity of wildfires across the nation.

The bill will be reviewed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Financial Services, wherein its provisions will undergo detailed examination to ensure thoughtful consideration of its implications.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced a bill aimed at directing the Secretary of Transportation to develop and implement a comprehensive Campus Modernization Plan for the United States Merchant Marine Academy. This initiative seeks to modernize the academy's facilities, enabling it to continue its essential role in training service-obligated licensed merchant mariners.

The bill was prompted by the urgent need for upgrades in the infrastructure of the academy, which has remained largely unchanged since its founding. The academy is crucial for the education of future leaders in the maritime sector and plays a significant part in ensuring national defense readiness. Nearly all of its current facilities are outdated and insufficient for the rigorous training and demanding coursework required by today’s midshipmen.

Through this legislation, the modernization effort is expected to bolster the academy’s ability to attract diverse applicants and enhance educational outcomes. The plan includes the construction of state-of-the-art classrooms, laboratories, and various training facilities, as well as necessary upgrades to utilities, such as electricity and water systems. It aims to create a safe and secure environment conducive to learning while also conserving resources through design-build contracts.

Funding for this ten-year modernization plan is proposed at $1.02 billion, with authorized appropriations gradually allocated from fiscal years 2026 through 2035. The initiative not only addresses the pressing need for infrastructure upgrades but also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a robust maritime workforce essential for U.S. economic and security interests. As the bill moves through the legislative process, support is anticipated from various stakeholders invested in the future of America's maritime education and defense capabilities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brandon Gill, R-TX, has introduced a bill aimed at securing a single, unique ZIP Code specifically for Northlake, Texas. This legislation is designed to enhance postal services and streamline mail delivery for residents, reflecting the growing need for improved infrastructure as the town expands.

The bill, introduced on March 27, 2025, addresses ongoing confusion and complications arising from the current postal setup, where Northlake shares its ZIP Codes with neighboring areas. As Northlake continues to grow, its distinct identity has become increasingly critical for ensuring accurate mail delivery and enhancing emergency services. By providing a dedicated ZIP Code, the legislation aims to improve response times for local services and prevent delays that residents have historically experienced.

The introduction of this bill also aligns with broader efforts to modernize postal services across the country. Proponents argue that a unique ZIP Code will promote local businesses and foster community cohesion, allowing residents to better identify with their town. Furthermore, the change is expected to serve as a catalyst for Northlake's economic growth by attracting new businesses and investments.

Should the bill pass, the U.S. Postal Service will have 270 days to implement the new ZIP Code. While it awaits deliberation in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, local leaders express optimism about the potential benefits, emphasizing the positive impact on the day-to-day lives of Northlake residents.

The move is not just administrative; it's seen as a necessary step toward enhancing the quality of life in the rapidly growing community of Northlake. If enacted, it could serve as a model for similar initiatives in other expanding towns facing postal challenges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sam Graves, R-MO, has introduced the Southwestern Power Administration Fund Establishment Act, which aims to create a dedicated fund within the U.S. Treasury to support the operations and maintenance of the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA). The proposed legislation seeks to enhance the agency's ability to manage power transmission and marketing efforts by ensuring financial resources are readily available.

The introduction of this bill responds to ongoing concerns about the efficient management and funding of electrical power in the Southwestern region of the United States. By establishing a dedicated fund, the act promises to streamline the financial operations of the SWPA, allowing for more effective planning and execution of energy projects. This initiative is particularly significant given the increasing demand for power and the need for modernized infrastructure to meet future energy challenges.

The SWPA, established by the federal government, plays a crucial role in delivering affordable electricity to thousands of customers, including municipalities and rural cooperatives. The proposed fund is designed to encompass various sources of revenue, including fees collected from electrical power sales, government appropriations, and unexpended balances from existing funds. This financial approach will enable the administration to respond more flexibly to emerging operational needs and infrastructure projects.

As the energy landscape evolves, this bill could have lasting implications on energy reliability and sustainability in the West. By promoting financial independence, the Southwestern Power Administration Fund Establishment Act aims to secure the resources necessary to maintain and advance essential power infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted service for future generations. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Appropriations for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2433",40434,"Rep. Green Introduces Reducing Medically Unnecessary Delays in Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mark E. Green, R-TN, has introduced the Reducing Medically Unnecessary Delays in Care Act of 2025, aimed at streamlining prior authorization processes for Medicare services. The bill seeks to ensure that medical decisions about patient care are based on professional judgement rather than administrative hurdles, thereby reducing delays in necessary treatments.

This legislation comes in response to increasing concerns about the barriers many Medicare beneficiaries face when accessing medical services. Reports indicate that these bureaucratic delays often lead to adverse health outcomes, prompting advocates to call for reforms that prioritize patient care and ease access to medical services. The act establishes that all preauthorization and adverse determinations must be made by licensed physicians with relevant specialty training, thereby ensuring that decisions are made based on clinical needs rather than cost-cutting measures by insurance companies.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it aims to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans relying on Medicare. By mandating that preauthorization requirements must be transparent, evidence-based, and easily accessible to patients and healthcare providers, the legislation is expected to foster an environment where timely medical interventions become the norm.

Additionally, the bill introduces provisions that require Medicare administrative contractors and plans to provide notice of any new preauthorization requirements at least 60 days in advance. This is designed to reduce confusion and help physicians better navigate the insurance landscape for their patients.

As it stands, the Reducing Medically Unnecessary Delays in Care Act has been referred to both the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees, indicating its critical importance in ongoing healthcare reforms.

The bill (H.R. 2433) introduced on 03/27/2025 has 14 co-sponsors: Rep. Murphy, Gregory F. [R-NC-3]...03/27/2025; Rep. Schrier, Kim [D-WA-8]...03/27/2025; Rep. Joyce, John [R-PA-13]...03/27/2025; Rep.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-WI, has introduced the No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit tax-exempt status for bonds used to finance professional sports stadiums. This legislation, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to eliminate the financial benefits historically enjoyed by sports franchises through tax breaks linked to stadium construction and renovation.

The motivation behind this bill stems from growing public concern over taxpayer funding being used for privately-owned stadiums. Critics argue that these subsidies disproportionately benefit wealthy team owners while placing an undue financial burden on the public. By removing the tax-exempt status for bonds associated with professional stadiums, the legislation aims to foster greater fiscal accountability in sports financing and encourage investments in public infrastructure that benefit broader communities.

If passed, the No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act would redefine what constitutes a professional stadium bond, ensuring that such bonds are no longer treated as tax-exempt under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code. This redefinition would apply to any bonds issued for facilities primarily used for professional sports exhibitions for more than five days a year. The legislation's proponents argue that the change would redirect resources toward more critical needs, such as education, healthcare, and essential public services.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Ways and Means, it highlights a growing trend among lawmakers to reassess government spending priorities related to sports franchises. It represents a significant shift in perspective on how public funds are allocated in the realm of professional sports.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2435",40434,"Rep. Hayes Introduces Save Our Small Farms Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-CT, has introduced the Save Our Small Farms Act to strengthen agricultural support for small farmers reliant on the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). This legislation aims to increase payouts, reduce paperwork burdens, and ease the transition to comprehensive risk management insurance policies.

The bill was prompted by concerns from small-scale farmers facing disproportionate challenges in accessing financial assistance during crop disasters. By proposing to lower the cost of purchasing coverage and simplifying the application process, the legislation seeks to provide substantial relief to these agricultural producers. Additionally, it includes incentives for farmers transitioning to more comprehensive insurance options, helping them secure better protection against potential losses.

The Save Our Small Farms Act emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of diverse farming systems, including urban and direct-to-consumer operations. By streamlining the process for submitting records and providing flexibility under the insurance framework, the bill intends to enhance farmers' ability to respond to adverse conditions while also promoting resilience in small-scale farming operations.

As small farms continue to be a vital part of the U.S. agricultural landscape, the bill reflects a growing recognition of the need for supportive policies that adapt to the unique challenges these farmers face. By reinforcing these support mechanisms, the Save Our Small Farms Act aims to foster a more secure and sustainable farming environment, ultimately contributing to the health of local economies and food systems across the country.

With the bill now referred to the House Committee on Agriculture, it awaits further deliberation and action that could significantly impact the future of small farm operations in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2436",40434,"Rep. Hern Introduces Bill to Cover Funeral Expenses with Health Savings Accounts","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kevin Hern, R-OK, has introduced legislation aiming to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow for health savings account (HSA) distributions to be used for funeral expenses of account beneficiaries. This change would categorize such distributions as qualified expenses, enabling families to access these funds during a critical time without incurring tax penalties.

This legislative effort comes in response to the growing financial burden of funeral costs, which can average upwards of $7,000. By permitting HSAs to cover these expenses, the bill seeks to ease the transition for families facing the loss of a loved one, allowing them to utilize pre-tax income for burial and memorial expenses. Specifically, the bill defines qualified funeral expenses to include costs associated with burial, cremation, and necessary services provided by funeral directors.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, particularly as a growing number of individuals manage their healthcare costs through HSAs. With healthcare costs on the rise, advocates argue that families should also be able to prepare for end-of-life expenses without financial stress. By expanding the use of HSAs in this way, the bill aims to provide families with flexibility and financial relief during one of life's most challenging moments.

The bill was introduced to the House Committee on Ways and Means on March 27, 2025, and is now set to undergo review. If passed, these amendments would apply to amounts paid after the enactment date, enhancing the financial planning tools available to families grieving the loss of a loved one.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2437",40434,"Rep. Houchin Introduces EASE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the EASE Act of 2025, aiming to enhance end-of-life care by mandating that hospitals inform discharged patients about available hospice programs and services under the Medicare program. This legislation seeks to improve access to vital information for individuals facing serious health conditions, ensuring they are better equipped to make informed decisions regarding their care upon discharge.

The introduction of the EASE Act stems from concerns about the lack of awareness among patients regarding hospice options, which are often critical for individuals diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Currently, many patients may leave the hospital without being informed about the hospice services available to them, potentially leading to a gap in essential care during a vulnerable time.

The proposed legislation requires hospitals to provide detailed information on hospice care, home health services, and extended care options tailored to the individual needs of patients. By making these requirements part of federal law, the EASE Act seeks to foster a more comprehensive approach to post-hospital care, helping patients navigate their options more effectively.

The potential impact of this bill is significant. With rising healthcare needs among an aging population, the EASE Act aims to ensure individuals receive appropriate support and access to palliative care, which has been shown to enhance the quality of life for those facing severe health challenges. By empowering patients with knowledge of their available resources, this initiative demonstrates a commitment to compassionate and patient-centered healthcare practices.

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, it will be referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, where its provisions and implications will be thoroughly evaluated.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the Foster Care Tax Credit Act aimed at providing financial support to foster families through a refundable tax credit. This legislation proposes a credit of $850 for eligible households that foster children, thereby alleviating some financial burdens associated with caring for foster youths.

The Foster Care Tax Credit Act was introduced to address the growing challenges that foster families face, particularly regarding the costs of fostering. Many of these families often navigate significant financial constraints while providing a safe environment for children who are in vulnerable situations. By instituting this tax credit, Rep. Houchin hopes to incentivize more households to consider fostering, thus improving the stability and quality of care available for foster children.

The bill outlines specific eligibility criteria for families wishing to claim the credit, which would enhance federal support for foster care placements. Eligible taxpayers must have a qualifying foster child placed in their home for at least a month during the tax year and not receive other tax credits for that child. 

Additionally, the proposed legislation seeks to improve data reporting on foster placements, requiring agencies to submit information on children placed within foster homes. This measure aims to enhance oversight and ensure that families meet the necessary qualifications for receiving the credits.

With this introduction, Houchin joins a broader movement within Congress to support foster care systems across the nation. The Foster Care Tax Credit Act is seen as a step toward alleviating the financial challenges faced by foster families, which may consequently attract more individuals to participate in caring for children in need, ultimately enhancing the foster care system's efficacy.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2439",40434,"Rep. Houlahan Introduces Support UNFPA Funding Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-PA, has introduced the Support UNFPA Funding Act, aiming to authorize financial support for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This crucial legislation seeks to address reproductive health care challenges globally, particularly in developing nations, by ensuring that U.S. contributions are restored and maintained. 

This bill responds to a pressing need for comprehensive reproductive health services as millions of women and girls continue to face preventable deaths due to complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. With nearly 800 women dying daily from these preventable causes, the UNFPA’s role becomes increasingly vital. The act recognizes the organization’s successes in promoting family planning, reducing gender-based violence, and addressing harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriage.

Houlahan’s bill is timely, particularly as funding cuts have placed significant constraints on the UNFPA's ability to operate effectively in humanitarian crises and fragile regions. Through this legislation, the U.S. government would allocate substantial funds—$50 million for fiscal year 2026 and $55 million for fiscal year 2027—specifically targeted at supporting UNFPA’s core functions. This includes interventions aimed at ending preventable maternal deaths, meeting contraceptive needs, and assisting in areas devastated by conflicts and disasters.

Moreover, the bill underlines the U.S. commitment to advancing global health and stability, viewing the elevation of women’s health as a cornerstone for community empowerment and economic development. The effectiveness of UNFPA has been validated by evaluations from international organizations, reinforcing the rationale for the U.S. to reinvest in its efforts to save lives and promote gender equality worldwide. Notably, the bill has garnered support from multiple representatives across the political spectrum, underscoring its bipartisan appeal.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, has introduced the School Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (SIFIA) aimed at enhancing school infrastructure across the nation through innovative financial solutions. The bill seeks to create tax credit bonds specifically designated for the design, construction, and renovation of qualified school facilities, allowing educators and local governments to access much-needed funding.

The initiative comes in response to the growing need for updated educational facilities that can support modern teaching methods and sustainable practices. With many schools across the country struggling to maintain and upgrade their buildings, Hudson's proposal emphasizes creating net-zero energy facilities that would drastically reduce energy costs and environmental impacts.

Moreover, the SIFIA Act is designed to provide significant financial relief for school districts seeking to improve infrastructure while ensuring they can maintain high standards of student safety and comfort. The bill proposed a framework in which private entities collaborate with school districts, ensuring that facilities meet stringent environmental targets while providing long-term operational support.

If enacted, the SIFIA Act is expected to impact numerous communities by not only providing necessary infrastructure improvements but also by stimulating local economies through job creation in construction and related sectors. The funding mechanism will focus on providing a credit that can help subsidize the costs associated with building projects, thus relieving some burdens from local taxpayers.

The legislation represents a strategic investment in the future of education, reflecting a commitment to ensuring that all students have access to conducive learning environments. As the bill moves through the legislative process, many stakeholders are watching closely, eager to see how it could reshape the educational landscape in the coming years.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-MI, has introduced the Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2025, designed to modernize the delivery of regulatory documents under the securities laws through electronic means. The bill aims to streamline access for investors, reducing reliance on traditional paper communications while maintaining regulatory compliance.

In recent years, the increasing digitization of financial services has prompted calls for regulatory reforms. Existing requirements often mandate the physical delivery of documents, a practice considered outdated in the digital era where electronic communication is the norm. Huizenga's legislation seeks to address these concerns by allowing covered entities, such as investment companies and brokers, the option to deliver regulatory materials electronically to investors.

The potential impact of this bill is significant. By facilitating electronic delivery, the proposed legislation could enhance accessibility to important investment information, promote efficiency in communications, and potentially reduce overhead costs for financial entities. Additionally, the bill outlines provisions that ensure investors who prefer traditional communication methods are not neglected. It mandates a transitional phase and annual reminders for such investors, allowing them the flexibility to opt out of electronic delivery.

This legislation arrives at a crucial time as advancements in technology continue to reshape the financial landscape. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be tasked with implementing these updates, proposing necessary rules within 180 days post-enactment, to ensure that no critical aspect of investor communication is omitted from traditional safeguards. 

Overall, the Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2025 represents a forward-thinking approach to modernizing financial regulation, responding to the evolving needs and preferences of today’s investors.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2442",40434,"Rep. Issa Introduces Freedom from Unfair Gun Taxes Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, has introduced the Freedom from Unfair Gun Taxes Act, aimed at prohibiting state-level excise taxes on firearms and ammunition manufacturers and dealers. This legislation seeks to eliminate what supporters describe as unfair financial barriers for those involved in the firearms industry.

The bill, introduced on March 27, 2025, underscores the ongoing national debate regarding gun rights and regulations. Proponents argue that state excise taxes hinder economic growth within the firearms sector, which is already subject to various federal regulations. By preventing states from imposing additional taxes, Issa aims to create a more favorable environment for firearm manufacturers and dealers, potentially boosting job creation and economic activity in the industry.

The context of this bill stems from ongoing concerns within the firearms community about state-level regulations perceived as overly burdensome. With certain states enacting their own taxes on firearm sales, advocates believe that such measures unfairly target an industry that contributes significantly to both employment and tax revenues at the federal level. The proposed Act aligns with broader Republican initiatives advocating for less regulation and greater support for businesses within the firearms sector.

If passed, the legislation could significantly impact how states approach revenue generation related to firearms sales. Its potential passage may also trigger pushback from gun control advocates who argue that such measures could undermine efforts to promote responsible gun ownership and public safety. The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it will undergo further scrutiny and debate. As discussions unfold, stakeholders from both sides of the issue are expected to engage in a vigorous dialogue about the implications of the proposed law.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-TX, has introduced the NPR and PBS Act, a bill aimed at eliminating federal funding for the National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The legislation seeks to prohibit taxpayer money from being allocated to what Jackson describes as partisan broadcasting outlets.

This bill comes amidst ongoing debates about the role of public media in American society, particularly accusations of bias in the content produced by NPR and PBS. Proponents argue that these organizations do not reflect the views of all taxpayers, suggesting that they maintain a liberal bias which undermines their mission to provide unbiased information. By cutting federal support, the bill aims to encourage these entities to seek alternative funding sources, such as private donations and sponsorships, thereby promoting financial independence and editorial freedom.

If passed, the NPR and PBS Act would significantly impact the operational budgets of both organizations. NPR and PBS rely heavily on federal support, and their funding cuts could lead to reduced programming and a decrease in the reach of educational content they provide. Critics of the bill express concern that such a move would hinder access to quality public broadcasting, particularly for underserved communities that benefit from federally-supported educational resources.

The proposal has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it will undergo further evaluation. Given the sharp divide on media funding in Congress, it remains uncertain whether the bill will gain sufficient traction to pass into law. The discussion surrounding this legislation highlights the broader issues of media accountability and the balance between public funding and editorial integrity in journalism.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2445",40434,"Rep. Kennedy Introduces Ensuring Medicaid Eligibility Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-UT, has introduced the Ensuring Medicaid Eligibility Act, aiming to prohibit the implementation of a recent rule designed to streamline the application and eligibility processes for Medicaid and related programs. The bill, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to reverse policies set forth by the previous administration that would allow for a more inclusive enrollment process for potential candidates seeking Medicaid assistance.

The bill comes in response to concerns raised by several lawmakers and advocacy groups regarding the potential consequences of the new rule. Supporters argue that streamlining could verify eligibility more efficiently, allowing more individuals to access needed health services. However, opponents assert that it might lead to undocumented individuals gaining access to benefits, thus straining resources and raising costs.

One of the critical aspects of the Ensuring Medicaid Eligibility Act is its strict enforcement on verifying citizenship or immigration status before enrolling individuals into the Medicaid program. The bill mandates the state to confirm that applicants are either citizens or possess satisfactory immigration status, ensuring that only eligible individuals receive Medicaid benefits. This provision is particularly significant amid ongoing debates about immigration reforms and healthcare availability.

In addition to the verification requirements, the legislation proposes to limit Medicaid coverage for specific immigrant categories, including those with temporary protected status (TPS) and individuals granted deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This aspect echoes broader political discussions surrounding immigration policy and health care access.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2446",40434,"Rep. Lawler Introduces Stop Antisemitism on College Campuses Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Michael Lawler, R-NY, has introduced the Stop Antisemitism on College Campuses Act, a legislative effort aimed at addressing rising antisemitism within U.S. educational institutions. The proposed bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prevent colleges and universities from hosting or endorsing antisemitic events by threatening the withdrawal of federal funding for those institutions.

The impetus for this bill arises from the increasing reports of antisemitic incidents on college campuses, which have sparked national conversations regarding campus safety and inclusivity. Lawler's measure explicitly prohibits educational institutions from authorizing events that promote antisemitism and ties compliance to eligibility for crucial student loan and grant programs. 

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it aims to deter institutions from permitting antisemitic rhetoric and events, reinforcing the importance of maintaining respectful and safe environments for all students. Proponents argue this could lead to greater accountability among universities regarding the events they allow on their campuses.

This legislative move joins a broader effort in Congress to combat hate crimes and discrimination targeting various groups. Earlier this year, multiple lawmakers raised concerns about antisemitism's prevalence, urging stronger actions across various levels of government. The bill's language includes a definition of antisemitism based on the guidelines provided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, ensuring clarity and consistency in enforcement.

As the Stop Antisemitism on College Campuses Act progresses through the legislative process, it will be reviewed by the House Committee on Education and Workforce, where discussions regarding its implications and potential revisions are expected.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-MI, has introduced the Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act, aimed at enhancing oversight of pharmacy benefit management services to improve prescription drug pricing transparency and affordability for consumers. The bill mandates robust reporting requirements from entities managing pharmacy benefits on behalf of health plans, addressing long-standing concerns over drug pricing and beneficiary spending.

The legislation comes at a time when rising drug costs continue to burden millions of Americans, prompting calls for greater accountability within the pharmaceutical supply chain. By enforcing stringent reporting obligations, the bill seeks to shed light on the financial dynamics between pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and consumers. Specifically, it requires pharmacy benefit managers to disclose detailed information about drug pricing, including net spending, rebates, and consumer out-of-pocket costs, thereby establishing a more transparent environment for healthcare pricing.

Should the bill pass, its implications would be significant. It is expected to empower consumers with accessible information, enabling them to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Moreover, the increased transparency could encourage competition within the pharmaceutical industry, potentially leading to lower prices over time. 

Rep. Rivet's initiative aligns with the broader efforts within Congress to grapple with the ongoing healthcare crisis, particularly as voters express growing anxiety over healthcare expenditures.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-MD, has introduced a bill to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to Doris Miller posthumously for his acts of valor as a member of the Navy during World War II. This legislation seeks to rectify historical oversight, as Miller, an African American sailor, distinguished himself in the face of enemy fire during the infamous Pearl Harbor attack but was never awarded the highest military honor for his bravery.

Doris Miller, who served aboard the USS West Virginia, became a symbol of courage when he risked his life to assist wounded shipmates after the ship was attacked in December 1941. Although he was recognized for his heroism with the Navy Cross, he stood unacknowledged alongside his peers who received the Medal of Honor for similar actions. This bill reflects a growing acknowledgment of the contributions of African Americans in the military, specifically during a time when racial discrimination restricted their roles.

This proposed legislation comes at a time when the nation is increasingly recognizing the need to honor all veterans fairly and evenly, especially those whose labors and sacrifices were historically marginalized. If passed, the bill promises not just to honor Miller’s legacy but also to strengthen the resolve of military relations regarding diversity and inclusion.

The action taken by Rep. Mfume and the co-sponsorship of various colleagues, including Ms. Norton and Mr. Carson, signals bipartisan support for this initiative, emphasizing the importance of correcting historical injustices. The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on Armed Services, paving the way for potential discussions on expanding recognition for other overlooked veterans.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-MD, has introduced the Doris Miller Congressional Gold Medal Act, aimed at honoring the legacy of Doris Miller, a distinguished African American sailor in the U.S. Navy during World War II. The bill seeks to posthumously award Miller the Congressional Gold Medal for his extraordinary acts of valor during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

This legislation addresses a significant historical oversight, as Miller's courageous actions were overlooked for many years. On December 7, 1941, he played a critical role in saving lives aboard the USS West Virginia, providing aid to wounded sailors and manning a machine gun despite lacking formal training. His heroism, recorded in official navy documentation, eventually earned him the Navy Cross, the second-highest military decoration awarded for valor.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader effort to recognize the contributions of African Americans in military history, particularly those who served in roles historically marginalized. Miller died in action in 1943, and his legacy symbolizes the courage and sacrifice of many African Americans who fought for their country under challenging circumstances.

Should the bill pass, it not only seeks to honor Miller's memory but also aims to inspire current and future generations about the values of bravery and service. The awarded gold medal would be presented by congressional leaders and would ultimately find a permanent home at the Smithsonian Institution for public display. This commemoration reinforces the importance of acknowledging all facets of American history, ensuring that heroes like Doris Miller are remembered and celebrated for their contributions and sacrifices in the service of the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gwen Moore, D-WI, has introduced the Worker Relief and Credit Reform Act of 2025, aimed at expanding and improving the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to better support low-income individuals and families. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code, making significant changes to EITC eligibility criteria and benefits.

The WRCR Act is a response to the growing need for financial assistance among working families, particularly in light of increasing living costs and inflation. By broadening eligibility to include qualifying students and adjusting income thresholds, the proposal intends to ensure more individuals can benefit from the credit. This enhancement is critically timed, as many families face economic pressures that affect their overall financial security.

Key provisions of the WRCR Act include applying the EITC to qualifying students who receive federal Pell Grants, lowering the qualifying age to 18, and allowing caregivers to be recognized as earning income. These adjustments aim to help younger workers and custodial caregivers who often struggle to meet traditional income reporting requirements.

Furthermore, the Act proposes a new system of advance payments for EITC, allowing families to receive portions of their tax credits monthly rather than as a lump sum at tax time. This strategy not only provides immediate support but also aims to stabilize the financial situations of eligible families throughout the year.

The introduction of the WRCR Act aligns with ongoing efforts by lawmakers to reform tax credits for families, making them more accessible in order to alleviate economic burdens. As the House Committee on Ways and Means reviews the bill, its anticipated impact on poverty reduction and economic wellness remains a focal point for advocates and constituents alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY, has introduced the Children’s Health Protection Act aimed at reinforcing the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard the health of children. This bill mandates the establishment and maintenance of the Office of Children’s Health Protection within the EPA, emphasizing federal responsibility to address environmental health risks affecting children.

The Children’s Health Protection Act was prompted by rising concerns regarding the impact of environmental hazards on children, particularly as studies indicate they are disproportionately affected by such risks. By guaranteeing the office’s continued operation, the bill seeks to ensure that children’s safety concerns remain a priority within federal environmental policies.

This legislation outlines several critical responsibilities for the newly affirmed Office of Children’s Health Protection, including assessing environmental health risks specifically affecting infants and adolescents. The office will also be tasked with advising both the EPA and other federal agencies on mitigating these risks, thereby facilitating a coordinated federal response to environmental threats impacting younger populations.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it not only highlights the need for more comprehensive legislation addressing environmental issues but also aims to improve children's overall health outcomes. By securing funding for the office and specifying the appointment of a director accountable for overseeing these initiatives, the legislation strengthens the federal framework aimed at protecting children from harmful environmental exposures.

The bill represents a revival of the EPA’s focus on children’s health, responding to advocacy from parents, health professionals, and environmentalists who have long pressed for enhanced protections for their most vulnerable populations. The Children’s Health Protection Act is currently being reviewed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further considerations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chris Pappas, D-NH, has introduced the Advancing Enrollment and Reducing Drug Costs Act, aimed at streamlining access to Medicare benefits for low-income individuals. This bill seeks to automatically qualify certain Medicaid beneficiaries for premium and cost-sharing subsidies under Medicare Part D, thereby easing prescription drug costs for vulnerable populations.

The legislation was prompted by ongoing concerns regarding the affordability of prescription medications for those transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare. Currently, many individuals face financial barriers when moving between these programs, leading to gaps in coverage and increased out-of-pocket costs. By ensuring that eligible individuals are automatically enrolled in subsidy programs, the bill aims to provide essential support and maintain continuity of care.

If passed, the Advancing Enrollment and Reducing Drug Costs Act could significantly impact millions of low-income individuals. It is projected that this measure would reduce prescription drug costs for a demographic that frequently struggles with affordability, ultimately improving their health outcomes by enhancing adherence to medication regimens. Such financial relief is particularly critical as rising drug prices continue to burden many Americans, especially retirees and those with chronic conditions.

The bill has been assigned to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means for further consideration. It includes amendments to existing Social Security Act provisions, stipulating that individuals enrolled in Medicaid and with incomes below 200% of the poverty line would be considered subsidy-eligible under Medicare Part D for specified periods.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Rouzer, R-NC, has introduced the Duplications of Benefits Victims Relief Act, aimed at amending key provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The legislation seeks to waive certain prohibitions on duplicating federal disaster relief benefits for individuals and entities affected by major disasters.

The Duplications of Benefits Victims Relief Act was proposed in light of frequent natural disasters that have resulted in significant loss for many Americans. The existing laws often prevent victims from receiving multiple forms of assistance for the same losses, potentially leaving them vulnerable in times of crisis. By allowing the President to waive these duplications, the act hopes to ensure that those affected can access every available resource for recovery. 

The proposed law would empower governors to request waivers from the federal government, allowing a more flexible approach to disaster relief funding. It specifies that the President could grant these waivers under certain circumstances, ensuring that assistance is equitable and justifiable. The bill prohibits income thresholds that might restrict access to aid, emphasizing a broader eligibility for victims of disasters.

If enacted, this law would not only provide more comprehensive support to disaster-stricken communities but also facilitate better coordination among federal, state, and local agencies in delivering aid. Furthermore, the act mandates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) produce a report on improving disaster assistance delivery, thus fostering continuous improvement in response systems.

As policymakers consider this legislation, its potential impact could transform the landscape of federal disaster relief, ensuring that victims receive the necessary support to rebuild their lives after devastating events.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Water Restoration Act, a legislative initiative aimed at strengthening protections for the nation’s water resources. The bill seeks to restore and revise federal regulations that have been altered in recent years, ensuring that wetlands and waterways receive essential safeguarding from pollution and degradation.

The introduction of this bill comes amid growing concerns over water quality and availability across the United States. With climate change intensifying weather patterns and increasing industrial activities threatening local ecosystems, the Clean Water Restoration Act aims to provide a comprehensive framework for water resource management. This legislation is also a response to various court rulings that have diminished the federal government's authority in regulating waterways, which has led to inconsistent protection across states.

This bill is expected to have a significant impact on both environmental preservation and public health. By reinstating robust protections for wetlands and streams, it not only supports biodiversity but also enhances flood control and water purification processes that are vital to communities. Moreover, by addressing the gaps in existing legislation, the Clean Water Restoration Act aims to ensure that clean drinking water remains accessible for all Americans.

Historically, the importance of clean water has been a bipartisan concern, with previous efforts leading to significant legislation like the Clean Water Act of 1972.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-FL, has introduced the John W. Walsh Alpha-1 Home Infusion Act of 2025, aimed at expanding Medicare coverage for treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disorder. The legislation seeks to provide reimbursement for home infusion therapies necessary for patients suffering from this genetic condition, which can lead to severe lung and liver disease.

The bill focuses on ensuring access to treatment for those enrolled in Medicare, specifically allowing for augmentation therapy to be administered in home settings by qualified medical professionals. This is particularly significant as many patients struggle to receive in-home care due to the current limitations in coverage, often forcing them into more costly healthcare settings. By enhancing access, the bill aims to improve the quality of life for affected individuals and decrease overall healthcare costs associated with hospitalizations.

Health professionals and advocates have long pressed for policy changes to support home infusion therapies, which can enhance patient comfort and recovery times while also easing the burden on healthcare facilities. The legislation is also seen as a response to rising healthcare costs and the growing demand for at-home care solutions, particularly in light of the ongoing emphasis on personalized and patient-centered healthcare models.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means. The introduction of the John W. Walsh Alpha-1 Home Infusion Act highlights a growing recognition of the need for accessible, specialized treatment options within the Medicare system, marking a step forward in addressing chronic healthcare challenges faced by patients with rare conditions.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-IL, has introduced the Water ISAC Threat Protection Act, aimed at enhancing the resilience of drinking water and wastewater systems in response to emerging threats. This legislation establishes a program designed to boost preparedness against both natural disasters and malevolent acts affecting community water systems.

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing concerns surrounding water security, particularly as natural disasters and cybersecurity threats become more frequent and sophisticated. The act proposes to create a framework for collaboration between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Water ISAC). This collaboration will foster a streamlined approach for data sharing and threat analysis, thereby enabling communities to better protect their water sources.

If enacted, the legislation would authorize $10 million annually for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. These funds would be allocated to help community water systems cover the costs associated with accessing the Water ISAC and enhancing their ability to identify and respond to various risks. This initiative is expected to significantly improve the overall safety and security of the nation’s water systems, especially for vulnerable communities relying on these essential services.

In recent years, the water sector has faced various challenges, from contamination scares to cyberattacks threatening operations nationwide. By promoting cooperation and resource-sharing among water providers, the act seeks to mitigate risks and strengthen infrastructure resilience. The bill has been referred to both the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure, as well as Energy and Commerce, for further consideration, highlighting its cross-sectoral importance in addressing the multifaceted challenges of water security.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Austin Scott, R-GA, has introduced the Ocmulgee Mounds National Park and Preserve Establishment Act aimed at designating the Ocmulgee Mounds as an official national park and preserve in Georgia. The legislation seeks to enhance cultural preservation, attract tourism, and expand local economy through an increased focus on heritage and environmental protection.

The Ocmulgee Mounds, an area rich in Native American history, provides an essential opportunity for public education about indigenous cultures, particularly that of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Currently designated as a national historical park, this new bill plans to create a comprehensive management framework that recognizes both natural and cultural resources within the area. It will enable land acquisition to ensure the park's sustainable development while prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire private lands.

By establishing the park and preserve, the bill emphasizes not only conservation but also community engagement, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to develop management plans in consultation with local tribes and stakeholders. This is particularly significant for the Muscogee Nation, ensuring their sacred sites and cultural landscapes are preserved and honored. The bill includes provisions for preferential hiring of tribe members for park roles, further promoting inclusivity and participation.

The potential impact of this legislation extends beyond cultural resilience: economically, it aims to bolster tourism by appending an enhanced visitor experience. As the park attracts more visitors, local businesses and services are likely to benefit from increased patronage. The Ocmulgee Mounds National Park and Preserve Establishment Act reflects a collaborative effort to safeguard heritage while encouraging economic growth within the region.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2346",40434,"Rep. Sherman Introduces Accountability for Terrorist Perpetrators of October 7th Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Sherman, D-CA, has introduced the Accountability for Terrorist Perpetrators of October 7th Act, aimed at imposing sanctions on the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) and other associated entities. This legislative proposal responds to escalating concerns regarding terrorism and geopolitical stability following the significant attacks on Israel by Hamas and its affiliates on October 7, 2023.

The bill outlines the historical context and actions of the PRC, detailing their involvement in orchestrating attacks against American and Israeli citizens, including a noted attack on a U.S. diplomatic convoy in 2003. In light of the deadly October 7 assault that claimed numerous lives and included wide-scale violence, Sherman’s legislation specifies that terrorism sanctions would be enacted against the PRC and entities operating under its influence. This includes blocking property and financial transactions, effectively penalizing financial networks that support such groups.

The introduction of this bill aligns with increasing calls for accountability and decisive action against organizations identified as terrorists. By targeting the funding mechanisms of the PRC, the bill seeks to diminish their operational capabilities and deter future attacks. The provisions mandate the President to enforce the sanctions within 90 days of the bill's enactment and provide a framework for ongoing oversight by Congress.

As terrorism continues to pose a significant threat to both national and international security, the Accountability for Terrorist Perpetrators of October 7th Act reflects a proactive legislative approach to safeguarding American interests and allies. With this measure, Rep. Sherman aims to affirm the U.S. commitment to combating terrorism through economic and legal means, emphasizing a coordinated response against those endangering global peace.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2347",40434,"Rep. Smucker Introduces Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-PA, has introduced the Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code and ensure that certain damages received by survivors of sexual acts and contact are excluded from gross income. This proposed legislation aims to alleviate the tax burdens faced by victims who receive compensatory damages through court judgments or settlement agreements, providing financial relief in the wake of trauma.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns regarding the financial implications faced by survivors of sexual violence when they receive compensatory damages. Under current tax law, many victims have reported being penalized by having these amounts counted as taxable income, which can significantly reduce the intended financial aid meant for recovery and support. The proposed changes could offer much-needed clarity and protection for survivors, relieving them from the additional financial burden that comes after an already traumatic experience.

If enacted, the Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act would modify Section 104 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing damages received for sexual acts and contact to be classified as non-taxable. Additionally, the bill seeks to minimize substantiation requirements, ensuring that victims are not required to provide medical records to affirm their claims. This provision recognizes the sensitive nature of such cases and promotes a more victim-centered approach.

The legislation is viewed as a crucial step towards ensuring justice for survivors, as it not only addresses tax policy but also reflects a broader commitment to supporting sexual assault victims. Rep. Smucker emphasizes the urgency of passing this bill, which highlights the need for a compassionate legislative response to the challenges faced by those who have suffered from sexual violence.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pete Stauber, R-MN, has introduced the Brake for Kids Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing public safety for schoolchildren across the United States. The legislation focuses on launching a nationwide educational campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of illegally passing stopped school buses, a concern that has increasingly vexed communities amid rising traffic incidents involving children.

The Brake for Kids Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to create and disseminate a comprehensive public safety messaging campaign aimed at educating the public on this critical issue. The legislation responds to alarming statistics that highlight the risks children face while boarding or disembarking from school buses. Advocates for child safety have long called for improved awareness and enforcement measures, prompting this timely legislative initiative.

Central to the campaign's strategy will be advertisements across various media platforms, including television, radio, social media, and digital streaming channels. Rep. Stauber's proposal emphasizes that the outreach must not only encompass digital formats but also ensure widespread distribution to reach audiences nationwide.

The act stems from a collaborative effort among several representatives, showcasing bipartisan support for child safety initiatives. As the number of children traveling to school continues to grow, the legislation seeks to mitigate the risks associated with increased traffic volumes around schools and bus routes.

If successful, the Brake for Kids Act could significantly impact public attitudes towards traffic laws pertaining to school buses. By fostering a culture of respect and caution on the road, lawmakers believe the campaign can contribute to a safer environment for children, helping to prevent tragic accidents and save lives. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for further consideration.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2350",40434,"Rep. Kustoff Introduces Cellphone Jamming Reform Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Kustoff, R-TN, has introduced the Cellphone Jamming Reform Act, a piece of legislation aimed at allowing state and federal correctional facilities to implement jamming technology. The bill seeks to give these institutions the authority to disrupt and prevent illegal communications within their walls, targeting contraband devices used by inmates.

The introduction of this bill comes amid rising concerns over the use of smuggled cell phones in prisons, which can facilitate criminal activities such as drug trafficking, gang operations, and other forms of violence. Correctional facilities across the nation have reported growing challenges associated with inmate communications that undermine safety and security protocols.

Should the bill pass, it would grant the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limited authority concerning operations of jamming systems in correctional facilities. This includes stipulations that such systems are restricted to the facility housing them and that any associated costs would be borne by the respective state. Additionally, facilities are required to consult with local law enforcement before implementing jamming technologies, ensuring a collaborative approach to security.

Supporters advocate that enabling jamming capabilities could significantly enhance safety inside and outside prison walls by limiting inmates’ ability to coordinate illicit activities. However, critics raise concerns about potential impacts on nearby communities and the effectiveness of jamming technologies, as they may inadvertently disrupt legitimate communications outside the facilities.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration. As correctional facilities grapple with the challenges posed by unauthorized communications, this legislation could set the stage for substantial changes in how inmate communications are managed in the future.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2352",40434,"Rep. Lee Introduces Abolish Super PACs Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Summer Lee, D-PA, has introduced the Abolish Super PACs Act, aiming to impose limitations on contributions to Super PACs in an effort to combat political corruption and restore public trust in the electoral process. This legislation seeks to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, targeting the escalating influence of unregulated financial contributions that have emerged since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision.

The introduction of this bill comes as concerns about the overwhelming financial influence of Super PACs on elections continue to grow. Recent elections have seen independent expenditures exceeding $4 billion, primarily funded by a small percentage of wealthy donors. Data shows that between 2008 and 2020, expenditures from Super PACs rose by over 700%, raising alarms about the potential for corrupt dealings between candidates and large contributors. 

Lee’s proposal aims to rectify these issues by implementing clear contribution limits for independent expenditure committees. This measure is designed to diminish the likelihood of quid pro quo arrangements, which have been highlighted in various corruption cases nationwide. As voters express increasing distrust in the political system, with a majority believing that heavy contributions yield political favors, this legislation intends to enhance transparency and accountability in campaign financing.

In addition to financial restrictions, the bill addresses criticisms about foreign interference in U.S. elections, positing that limiting contributions to Super PACs can hinder foreign entities from circumventing regulations through third parties. The Abolish Super PACs Act represents a significant effort by lawmakers to recalibrate the balance of power in campaign financing, placing the interests of average voters over those of affluent donors. If passed, this legislation could reshape political funding dynamics, aiming to create a more equitable electoral landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Incentives Act aimed at promoting renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions across the United States. The bill proposes a series of tax credits and grants to encourage businesses and homeowners to adopt solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies.

The Clean Energy Incentives Act comes in response to growing concerns over climate change and the urgent need for the country to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. With the Biden administration prioritizing clean energy initiatives, Rep. Smith's legislation is seen as a crucial step in achieving national climate goals while simultaneously boosting the economy. As state and local governments strive to meet their sustainability targets, this bill provides much-needed financial support for citizens looking to make greener choices.

One of the key components of the bill is the extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy installations, which would encourage more homeowners and businesses to invest in solar panels. Additionally, the legislation proposes grants for low-income families to upgrade to energy-efficient appliances, making clean energy more accessible to all socio-economic groups. The potential impact of this bill could be significant, leading to an increase in renewable energy jobs and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Historically, the U.S. has lagged behind other nations in adopting renewable energy technology, but with bipartisan support for climate action growing, the Clean Energy Incentives Act presents an opportunity to take a proactive stance towards a sustainable future. If enacted, this bill could not only enhance the nation's environmental policy but also stimulate economic growth through innovative green technologies.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Blake Moore, R-UT, has introduced the Restoring Temporary to TANF Act, a bill aimed at amending the Social Security Act to ensure that funding from block grants to states for temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) is used more effectively to support work-related activities. The legislation mandates that at least 25 percent of TANF funds must be dedicated to work supports, training, apprenticeships, and other related services designed to enhance self-sufficiency among recipients.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to concerns regarding the utilization of TANF funds, which have been criticized for not adequately promoting workforce participation. Currently, many states use these funds for various non-essential programs, which can detract from the core purpose of TANF: to provide temporary assistance that encourages work and self-sufficiency. By realigning these resources, Moore aims to bolster programs that directly contribute to employment readiness.

If passed, the bill is expected to have a significant impact on families relying on TANF assistance, enhancing their opportunities to receive education and job training. Proponents argue that increasing work-related support will help lift more individuals and families out of poverty and promote economic stability within communities.

The proposed amendment necessitates that the plan be implemented by October 1, 2026, setting a timeline for states to adjust their TANF funding allocations. The move aligns with broader goals of federal welfare reform, focusing on delivering tangible outcomes for those in need through improved funding strategies. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further review.

The bill (H.R. 2354) was introduced on 03/26/2025.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2355",40434,"Rep. Moore Introduces Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Blake Moore, R-UT, recently introduced the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act aimed at enhancing funding for collegiate housing through new infrastructure grants. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow charitable organizations to offer grants specifically designated for the improvement and maintenance of collegiate housing properties.

The initiative was introduced in response to the growing challenge of providing adequate housing for the increasing number of college students. With student enrollment rising across the nation, many universities have struggled to meet the housing demand, leading to overcrowded dormitories and insufficient living conditions. By facilitating funding for necessary infrastructure upgrades, the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act is expected to improve living conditions for students, promote academic success, and foster a better college experience.

Under the proposed legislation, collegiate housing grants would enable the enhancement and operation of properties that accommodate full-time students. This change is particularly significant given that many college dormitories and housing facilities require essential repairs and upgrades that often go unfunded. The new grant provisions could alleviate financial burdens on institutions while enhancing the quality of student housing across the country.

The Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act aligns with broader efforts to make higher education more accessible, recognizing that adequate housing is essential for student retention and academic performance. As the bill moves through Congress, stakeholders in education and housing are expected to monitor its progress closely, hopeful that it will lead to meaningful improvements in student living conditions.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2356",40434,"Rep. Massie Introduces Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Thomas Massie, R-KY, has introduced the Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act, a proposed bill aimed at enhancing transparency in U.S. electoral politics. The legislation seeks to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by requiring candidates to disclose any foreign citizenship during the designation of their principal campaign committees.

The initiative reflects growing concerns about dual citizenship and loyalty among elected officials. By mandating disclosure of foreign citizenship, the bill aims to inform voters about potential conflicts of interest for those seeking public office. As political discourse increasingly focuses on national security and integrity, supporters argue this measure will bolster accountability in the electoral process.

The Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act responds to a contentious political climate where questions of allegiance are prevalent. It emphasizes that candidates must declare if they hold citizenship in any nation other than the United States, aiming to enhance public trust in elected officials. Opinions on such disclosures vary; proponents believe this requirement would deter candidates with conflicting allegiances, while critics may argue it stigmatizes individuals with dual citizenship unnecessarily.

If passed, the bill would become effective upon enactment, applying to all future candidates for federal office. As political campaigns grow more complex and diverse, emphasizing transparency and integrity may resonate with a disenchanted electorate. As discussions about national identity and loyalty within a globalized society continue, this legislation could spark larger conversations on immigration, citizenship rights, and the responsibilities of public officials.

The proposal has been referred to the House Committee on House Administration for review. With a growing number of cosponsors, including other represented officials, the Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act may significantly influence the upcoming electoral landscape.

The bill (H.R. 2356) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 5 co-sponsors: Rep. Biggs, Andy [R-AZ-5]...03/26/2025; Rep. Higgins, Clay [R-LA-3]...03/26/2025; Rep. Greene, Marjorie Taylor [R-GA-14]...03/26/2025; Rep. Begich, Nicholas [R-AK-At Large]...03/31/2025; Rep. Nehls, Troy E. [R-TX-22]...04/07/2025.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2357",40434,"Rep. Adams Introduces Food Secure Strikers Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Alma S. Adams, D-NC, has introduced the Food Secure Strikers Act aimed at safeguarding the nutritional benefits of workers engaged in strikes. This legislation seeks to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, ensuring that striking workers and their households remain eligible for assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

This bill comes in response to growing concerns about the financial impact of strikes on workers and their families. As labor actions become more frequent, there remains a heightened risk that those who participate in strikes could lose access to essential food assistance programs—compounding their financial hardships during already turbulent times. The act addresses this issue by removing provisions that could lead to the ineligibility of striking workers under SNAP.

The potential impact of the Food Secure Strikers Act is significant. By reinforcing the eligibility criteria for SNAP, it aims to provide a safety net for families facing the loss of wages during labor disputes. This not only supports the immediate needs of these workers but also contributes to broader economic stability by enabling families to maintain their purchasing power during strikes.

The introduction of this bill reflects a shift towards more supportive labor policies amidst a national conversation on workers' rights and protections. With increasing unionization efforts across various industries, lawmakers are acknowledging the need to ensure that workers are not penalized for exercising their right to strike.

Rep. Adams, alongside an array of co-sponsors, is hopeful that the Food Secure Strikers Act will not only be well-received but also lead to swift action in Congress, helping workers maintain their dignity and food security while advocating for better working conditions.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2358",40434,"Rep. Barr Introduces ESG Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andy Barr, R-KY, has introduced the ESG Act of 2025, aimed at amending the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to establish guidelines on how financial advisors consider both pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors when advising clients. This legislation also tasks the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with conducting comprehensive studies related to environmental disclosures in the municipal bond market.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns over how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are influenced in investment decisions. With increasing scrutiny on the effectiveness and transparency of these assessments, the ESG Act seeks to create clearer requirements and disclosures for financial advisors, effectively prioritizing financial performance over non-financial considerations.

One of the core elements of the bill mandates that financial advisors must assess clients' best interests based on monetary benefits unless otherwise agreed upon. This requirement aims to safeguard investors from potential biases originating from non-pecuniary factors. Additionally, the bill proposes that the SEC must produce reports detailing the scope of current environmental disclosures in the municipal bond market and assess their alignment with broader investor expectations. 

This legislation is particularly relevant as it highlights the tension between traditional investment strategies focused on financial gains and the newer trend of incorporating ESG aspects. The outcome of the SEC's studies could significantly impact investment practices and the future of sustainable finance, especially in the context of municipal securities and compliance regulations. As discussions around climate change and ethical investing continue to evolve, the ESG Act may pave the way for more stringent norms in the financial advisory landscape.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2359",40434,"Rep. Carey Introduces Improve Transparency and Stability for Families and Children Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Carey, R-OH, has introduced the Improve Transparency and Stability for Families and Children Act, aimed at enhancing the management of federal funds allocated to states under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The legislation sets firm deadlines for states to obligate and spend these funds, promoting fiscal responsibility and better support for families in need.

The impetus for this bill arose from concerns regarding the efficient use of TANF funds, which are crucial for providing assistance to low-income families. Currently, there are instances where allocated funds remain unspent or unused, leading to a lack of financial stability for many households needing immediate assistance. By establishing clear timelines, the bill seeks to ensure that resources are not only allocated but also actively utilized to aid vulnerable populations.

This legislation would require states to obligate TANF funds by the end of the succeeding fiscal year and expend them by the end of the second succeeding fiscal year. Furthermore, to encourage prudent financial management, states could reserve a small percentage of these funds for future use, but only under specified limits. This aspect of the bill introduces a rainy day fund mechanism, allowing for flexibility while still maintaining oversight.

The Improve Transparency and Stability for Families and Children Act is positioned to significantly impact family welfare and state budgeting practices by fostering a culture of accountability among states. As the legislation progresses through the House Committee on Ways and Means, stakeholders are encouraged to consider the implications of improved fiscal transparency and its potential to empower families facing economic hardship.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2360",40434,"Rep. Carter Introduces School Bus Drivers' Testing Exemption Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John R. Carter, R-TX, has introduced a bill aimed at permanently extending the exemption from the engine compartment portion of the pre-trip vehicle inspection skills testing requirement for school bus drivers. This legislative effort responds to ongoing concerns regarding the challenges school bus drivers face during skills testing, particularly those related to mechanical inspection procedures.

The bill is positioned as a critical measure to alleviate burdens on school bus drivers, who are often required to pass stringent vehicle inspection tests to obtain or retain their commercial driver’s licenses. Current regulations require drivers to demonstrate competence in inspecting various engine components, a requirement some argue is not representative of their daily responsibilities. By exempting the engine compartment inspection, the new bill is expected to streamline the certification process, encouraging more individuals to consider driving school buses, where there is a persistent shortage.

The potential impact of the legislation is multifaceted. Advocates argue that easing the certification process will not only help address the driver shortage but will also enhance the efficiency of student transportation. This could lead to improved safety and reliability in school transportation services across Texas and potentially nationwide if adopted at the federal level.

Prior attempts to introduce similar measures underscore a growing recognition of the logistical challenges faced by school bus operators. Currently, the exemption is temporary but was recently noted in the Federal Register, reflecting evolving industry needs. If passed, this bill would solidify this exemption into permanent law, marking a significant change in the landscape of school bus driver certification and potentially reshaping the framework for future transportation legislation.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2361",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Cameras in the Courtroom Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Cameras in the Courtroom Act, a legislation aimed at allowing televised coverage of all proceedings held by the Supreme Court. This initiative seeks to enhance public access to one of the nation’s highest judicial bodies, fostering transparency and public engagement with the legal system.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about the importance of transparency in government and judicial processes. Advocates argue that allowing cameras in the Supreme Court could demystify the judicial process for the public, offering a firsthand look at the Court's proceedings and deliberations. With significant decisions made that affect various aspects of American life, proponents believe that such visibility could empower citizens and promote a deeper understanding of judicial reasoning.

The bill proposes that the Supreme Court should permit television coverage of all open sessions unless a majority of justices determine that doing so could jeopardize the due process rights of involved parties. This safeguard aims to balance the public's right to information with the necessity of fairness in legal proceedings. As it stands, public access to Supreme Court arguments is limited, creating a barrier to understanding for many interested citizens.

If passed, the Cameras in the Courtroom Act could represent a significant shift in how the Supreme Court interacts with the public and media. In an era characterized by a demand for transparency and accountability, supporters hope this legislation could set a precedent for more visibility within all branches of government, ultimately enriching the democratic process. The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-TX, has introduced the VA Home Loan Awareness Act of 2025, aimed at increasing awareness of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) home loan programs. This legislation mandates that a specific disclaimer be added to the Uniform Residential Loan Application to inform applicants with military service that they may qualify for VA home loans.

The impetus for this bill comes from data indicating that many eligible veterans and active-duty service members are unaware of their benefits regarding home financing. Despite the favorable terms associated with VA loans, such as no down payment and no private mortgage insurance, outreach efforts have often fallen short. By requiring the disclaimer, the bill seeks to enhance the visibility of such programs, ensuring that those who have served receive the financial assistance they deserve.

The proposed legislation not only aims to simplify the application process for veterans but also mandates a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This study will assess whether at least 80% of lenders include the required disclaimer, providing a measure of accountability in the lending community. 

With VA home loans playing a crucial role in housing accessibility for veterans, the act could potentially impact thousands of service members, facilitating their transition into homeownership. Increased awareness may encourage more veterans to take advantage of these benefits, leading to higher rates of home ownership within this demographic.

By addressing the oversight in informing veterans about their options, the VA Home Loan Awareness Act of 2025 highlights the importance of ensuring that those who have served in the military are not only recognized but also adequately supported in their pursuit of home ownership. The bill has already drawn bipartisan support, reflecting a shared commitment to the welfare of veterans.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Diana DeGette, D-CO, has introduced the DOGE POUND Act of 2025 to enhance the protection of individually identifiable health information. This critical piece of legislation seeks to limit access to sensitive health data by restricting authorization to specific individuals affiliated with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and those with the requisite security clearances.

The bill was prompted by growing concerns regarding unauthorized access to health information systems, especially in light of increased data breaches and the evolving landscape of healthcare technology. By prohibiting access to critical health data to unauthorized people, DeGette aims to bolster privacy protections and enhance the security of sensitive information.

The DOGE POUND Act outlines stringent criteria for individuals seeking access to HHS systems, requiring them to have held security clearances and meet established compliance training standards. It makes provisions for penalties, including fines and imprisonment for those who violate access protocols. Reports on any unauthorized access incidents must also be forwarded to Congress within 30 days of occurrence, enabling timely oversight and risk assessment.

The introduction of this legislation reflects broader bipartisan efforts to improve cybersecurity and data privacy, particularly in sectors handling personal health information. As data breaches become increasingly common, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities is more critical than ever. The anticipated impact of the DOGE POUND Act could establish new benchmarks for privacy protections in healthcare, ensuring only suitable personnel manage sensitive data.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-NC, has introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery Act, a bill aimed at streamlining disaster relief for small businesses affected by recent natural disasters. This legislation proposes a waiver process for duplicative benefits under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, allowing for more efficient distribution of aid.

The Helene Small Business Recovery Act was conceived as a response to challenges faced by small business owners who have experienced significant setbacks due to disasters. The existing regulations often complicate the recovery process, hindering timely assistance when it is most needed. By waiving the prohibition on duplicative benefits, this bill seeks to alleviate barriers that prevent businesses from accessing necessary resources for recovery.

Should the bill pass, it could have a considerable impact on the speed and efficacy of federal aid in the aftermath of disasters. The proposed changes would empower state governors to request waivers from the President, enabling a more flexible response tailored to the unique circumstances of each disaster. This adaptive approach is expected to ensure that affected businesses can receive the financial support they require without lengthy bureaucratic delays.

Notably, the bill indicates that no income threshold will be applied, making it inclusive for all small businesses affected by disasters declared in 2023 and 2024. This aspect is particularly significant, as it aims to address the needs of diverse business owners, ensuring equitable access to recovery resources.

As the bill progresses through the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, its supporters are optimistic about the potential relief it could provide to small business owners navigating the aftermath of natural disasters.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tom Emmer, R-MN, has introduced the Securities Clarity Act of 2025, aimed at modernizing the regulatory framework around digital assets. This bill seeks to exclude investment contract assets, commonly associated with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, from being classified as securities under existing law, thereby clarifying their status and fostering innovation.

The Securities Clarity Act of 2025 was launched in response to the growing complexity and uncertainty surrounding the regulation of digital assets. As the market for cryptocurrencies expands, financial regulators have struggled to keep pace with technological advancements. Emmer's legislation aims to establish a clear legal definition of investment contract assets to reduce compliance burdens for issuers and to promote the responsible development of the digital asset sector.

The potential impact of this bill could be significant for both entrepreneurs and investors in the cryptocurrency space. By providing clarity, it encourages investment and innovation while mitigating fears of overregulation. This could lead to enhanced economic growth and job creation in the burgeoning field of blockchain technology and digital finance.

Historically, the classification of digital assets has varied, with some being labeled as securities subject to stringent regulations, which can deter entrepreneurs from pursuing legitimate ventures. The Securities Clarity Act seeks to streamline this process, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability in a rapidly evolving industry.

As this legislation progresses through the House Financial Services Committee, supporters argue that it will not only strengthen the United States’ position in the global digital economy but also ensure consumer protection without stifling innovation. Emmer’s advocacy reflects a growing recognition in Congress of the need to balance security and foster growth in emerging technologies.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-TX, has introduced the American Families United Act, a piece of legislation aimed at amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to enhance family unity for U.S. citizens and their relatives. The bill, introduced on March 26, 2025, seeks to provide discretion for the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to grant relief from removal for family members of U.S. citizens, particularly when family separation poses a significant hardship.

The American Families United Act was introduced in response to ongoing challenges faced by immigrant families in the U.S., particularly in light of stringent immigration policies that have led to family separations and deportations. Supporters of the bill argue that preserving family unity is fundamental to American values and is crucial for the emotional and mental well-being of U.S. citizens and their loved ones. The proposed changes would allow discretion to waive grounds of inadmissibility and to halt removal proceedings under specific circumstances, providing a more humane approach to immigration enforcement.

This legislation holds the potential to impact thousands of families facing separation due to immigration laws. By allowing the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to consider family connections in removal cases, the bill emphasizes the importance of familial relationships in immigration policy. If passed, it could lead to a significant shift in how families are treated within the immigration system, fostering greater stability and support for U.S. citizens and their loved ones.

The American Families United Act is currently referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further review and discussion, where it will undergo deliberations before potentially moving forward in the legislative process.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2367",40434,"Rep. Houchin Introduces College Employment Accountability Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the College Employment Accountability Act, which aims to prevent higher education institutions that employ unauthorized immigrants from accessing federal student aid and requires participation in the E-Verify program.

The legislation is a response to ongoing concerns regarding immigration compliance in educational institutions. By enforcing stricter eligibility criteria for federal assistance, the bill seeks to ensure that taxpayer-funded scholarships and grants do not support schools that may undermine immigration laws. This move aligns with broader national efforts to enforce immigration policies and hold educational institutions accountable for their hiring practices.

If passed, the College Employment Accountability Act would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, specifically by prohibiting federal funding to colleges and universities found in violation of hiring regulations regarding unauthorized aliens. Additionally, institutions would be required to participate in the E-Verify program, which verifies employee eligibility through a federal system, making compliance easier to monitor.

The potential impact of this bill is substantial, as it could significantly alter the landscape of higher education funding. Schools that fail to comply with these regulations might face financial repercussions, prompting them to reassess their employment practices. Observers suggest this could lead to increased accountability among educational institutions, fostering an environment where legal hiring practices are prioritized.

Introduced on March 26, 2025, the bill was referred to the House Committees on Education and Workforce and Judiciary for further consideration. As discussions around immigration and employment laws continue, Rep. Houchin’s proposal reflects a targeted approach to ensuring that federal resources are allocated responsibly within the education sector.

The bill (H.R. 2367) was introduced on 03/26/2025.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2368",40434,"Rep. Ivey Introduces Raise the Age Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-MD, has introduced the Raise the Age Act of 2025, legislation aimed at prohibiting federally licensed firearms dealers from selling certain semiautomatic centerfire rifles and shotguns to individuals under the age of 21. This bill, introduced on March 26, 2025, includes specific exemptions for active duty military personnel and full-time law enforcement officers.

The intent behind the Raise the Age Act arises from growing concerns over gun violence and the role of firearms accessibility for young adults. Recent studies indicate a correlation between access to semiautomatic weapons and an increase in violent incidents among youths, prompting lawmakers to consider stricter regulations. By raising the age limit, the legislation seeks to limit potential risks associated with firearm ownership among those who may not possess the maturity to handle such weapons responsibly.

Proponents of the bill argue that it could significantly decrease youth-involved gun violence and enhance public safety. The proposed legislation complements existing gun control measures and is expected to spark further discussions on gun regulation at the federal level. As of now, the bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for review.

If enacted, the Raise the Age Act would amend current regulations in title 18 of the United States Code, setting a new standard for firearm sales. Law enforcement officials and military personnel would still have access under the established guidelines, ensuring that those in professions requiring firearm training remain unaffected. 

The bill's introduction adds to the ongoing debate surrounding firearm legislation in the U.S., highlighting the increasing pressure on federal legislators to address gun violence while balancing Second Amendment rights.

The bill (H.R. 2368) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 119 co-sponsors.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mike Kelly, R-PA, has introduced the Personal Health Investment Today (PHIT) Act of 2025 aimed at incentivizing physical fitness by allowing certain expenses for physical activities to be classified as medical care under the Internal Revenue Code. This legislation seeks to encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce medical costs associated with obesity-related diseases.

The PHIT Act allows individuals to deduct costs related to fitness memberships, classes, and equipment as qualified medical expenses, aiming to alleviate the financial burden linked to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. With obesity rates continuing to climb in the United States, the bill's proponents argue that increasing access to fitness options can significantly impact public health by encouraging physical activity.

This bill proposes a cap of $1,000 on qualified expenses for individuals, and $2,000 for families filing jointly, which can be deducted from their taxable income. Qualified expenses include fees for gyms, fitness classes, and even exercise videos that meet specific criteria intended to enhance physical fitness. The legislation reflects a growing recognition of preventive health measures and aims to shift the focus towards proactivity in maintaining health rather than solely treating illnesses.

Supporters believe the PHIT Act could lead to a reduction in healthcare costs resulting from obesity and related health conditions, aligning with broader public health initiatives aimed at combating chronic diseases. As America seeks solutions to the obesity crisis, the introduction of this bill represents a potential legislative shift towards endorsing preventative health measures through fiscal incentives.

Rep. Kelly's bill is currently awaiting deliberation by the House Committee on Ways and Means as it aims to promote tangible changes in health and wellness practices across the country.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Young Kim, R-CA, has introduced the Taiwan Travel and Tourism Coordination Act, aimed at strengthening cooperation between the United States and Taiwan in the travel and tourism sectors. The bill, introduced on March 26, 2025, seeks to enhance bilateral engagement and promote tourism between the two countries.

The legislation arises from a growing recognition of the importance of cultural, economic, and personal exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan. As tensions in the Indo-Pacific region rise, enhancing ties with Taiwan is seen as a strategic necessity for the United States, which could strengthen both nations' economic stands. The bill mandates the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to coordinate efforts with Taiwanese authorities to identify opportunities for promoting travel and enhancing the tourism industries of both countries.

Key provisions of the act include the requirement for annual reports to Congress on the progress of these initiatives and an assessment of potential preclearance facilities in Taiwan, aimed at streamlining travel and enhancing security for U.S.-bound travelers. This feature is crucial in light of increasing tourist and business travel, which can bolster the economy of both nations.

The proposed act has garnered attention in light of Taiwan's growing role in global trade and tourism. Advocates for the bill argue that it will not only fortify diplomatic ties but also foster economic growth through tourism. As the U.S. seeks to support Taiwan amidst regional challenges, this legislation highlights the importance of cooperation in tourism as a means to reinforce broader diplomatic efforts and cultural exchanges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sam Liccardo, D-CA, has introduced the Scarper Ridge Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act, aimed at expanding the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) to include Scarper Ridge property. This legislative move seeks to enhance public access to recreational land and preserve its natural beauty.

The initiative comes in response to increasing calls for the protection of outdoor spaces in Northern California, where natural lands are under pressure from urban development and climate change. By formally adjusting the boundaries of the GGNRA, the bill seeks not only to safeguard the Scarper Ridge property but also to bolster conservation efforts throughout the region.

If passed, the act will effectively integrate Scarper Ridge into the existing GGNRA, allowing for improved management of the area and enhanced visitor experiences. The GGNRA is already a popular destination for hiking, biking, and various outdoor activities, drawing millions of visitors annually. Incorporating Scarper Ridge is expected to further elevate the recreational opportunities available to residents and tourists alike.

The proposal underscores the broader trend of prioritizing environmental protection and sustainable land use in legislative agendas. Supporters argue that this boundary adjustment is essential for safeguarding local wildlife, enhancing biodiversity, and ensuring that future generations retain access to vibrant natural landscapes.

Liccardo's bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for review. Continued advocacy from both local organizations and environmental groups may play a critical role in its advancement through Congress. As lawmakers grapple with rising urban pressures, initiatives like this highlight the importance of preserving public lands for future enjoyment and ecological health.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ted Lieu, D-CA, has introduced the DEVICE Act, designed to enhance communication protocols regarding medical devices and ensure their cleanliness through updated reporting requirements. The bill aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address deficiencies in existing regulations.

The introduction of the DEVICE Act comes in response to increasing concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of medical devices. Recent incidents involving device malfunctions and contamination have sparked calls for stricter oversight and improved manufacturer accountability. The legislation seeks to establish a framework that mandates medical device manufacturers to report significant design changes and safety updates more transparently and promptly to both healthcare providers and regulatory bodies. 

Among its key provisions, the DEVICE Act requires manufacturers to notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services within five days of any communication regarding changes in device design or safety concerns. This will enhance the flow of vital information to healthcare providers in foreign markets, which is critical for maintaining patient safety across borders. 

In addition, the act introduces a requirement for “rapid assessment tests” that ensure reusable devices are properly sanitized before each use. This will significantly reduce the risk of cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections, a longstanding issue within the healthcare system. 

This legislation reflects a broader push for modernizing healthcare regulations to improve patient outcomes while ensuring that innovation in medical device technology aligns with rigorous safety standards. The DEVICE Act represents a proactive step toward safeguarding public health by enhancing the reliability and transparency of medical device communication in the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare technology.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, has introduced the Increased Accountability for Nonconsensual Pornography Act of 2025, a bill aimed at enhancing protections against the unauthorized sharing of intimate images. The legislation seeks to amend existing laws to establish more stringent civil penalties for such violations.

The bill arises from growing concerns about the prevalence of nonconsensual pornography, commonly referred to as revenge porn. Many victims face challenges when seeking justice, as current laws are often insufficient or convoluted. By increasing the fine from $150,000 to $500,000 for offenders, Mace intends to deter individuals from sharing intimate images without consent and provides more avenues for victims to hold perpetrators accountable.

This legislative effort underscores a broader awareness of the harm caused by unauthorized image sharing. Victims often experience significant emotional and psychological distress, damaging their personal and professional lives. The bill aims to create a framework that recognizes the gravity of these offenses and provides victims with substantial recourse.

In recent years, several states have enacted similar laws to combat this issue, but a unified federal standard has yet to be established. Mace's bill represents a proactive step toward addressing this pressing concern at the national level, promoting a safer and more respectful digital environment.

The proposed changes are set to be reviewed by the House Judiciary Committee, where discussions will focus on the bill's implications and its potential to foster greater accountability. If passed, the legislation could serve as a model for further strengthening protections against violations of privacy in the digital age.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, has introduced the American Students First Act, aimed at restricting federal financial assistance to public institutions of higher education that offer benefits to undocumented students. The legislation intends to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to tighten eligibility criteria regarding federal funding for universities that provide lower tuition rates or state-based financial aid to non-lawfully present aliens.

The introduction of this bill comes amid increasing concerns over the allocation of educational resources and financial aid in higher education. Supporters of the American Students First Act argue that unauthorized immigrants should not receive the same financial benefits as U.S. citizens and residents, which could strain state budgets and college resources. They contend that prioritizing citizens will ensure that American students have greater access to educational opportunities and support.

If passed, the legislation would render any university ineligible for federal funding if it charges undocumented students tuition rates equivalent to those of resident citizens or provides them with state financial aid. Institutions found in violation of this provision would face strict financial repercussions, potentially limiting their operational capabilities. This could lead to significant changes in how universities structure tuition and manage financial aid programs.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, as well as the Committee on Education and Workforce, for further consideration. Advocates on opposing sides are already anticipating a vigorous debate as lawmakers evaluate the implications of restricting educational access based on immigration status. With increasing polarization on immigration policy, discussions surrounding this bill could shape the future of higher education and immigrant rights in the U.S.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-RI, has introduced the Rhode Island Fishermen’s Fairness Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing the representation of Rhode Island in federal fisheries management. The bill proposes an amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which will officially add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to ongoing concerns from local fishermen regarding the lack of direct representation in fishery management decisions. Historically, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council has excluded Rhode Island from its jurisdiction despite the state’s significant involvement in the fishing industry. This omission has raised issues regarding fair access to fishing resources and equitable management practices.

The potential impact of the Rhode Island Fishermen’s Fairness Act is substantial. By including Rhode Island in the council, local fishermen will gain a voice in decisions that directly affect their livelihoods. It is expected that this change will not only promote fairness but will also improve the sustainability and management of fish stocks in the region, benefiting both the community and the ecosystem.

The bill also reflects broader trends in fisheries management, emphasizing collaborative and inclusive practices that account for regional needs. With Rhode Island's fishing industry being a vital part of its economy and cultural identity, stakeholders believe that this legislative step is crucial for not just economic growth but also for ensuring environmental sustainability.

Rep. Magaziner's move has garnered support from local officials and fishing advocates who see this as an opportunity to strengthen Rhode Island's fisheries while promoting responsible resource management. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources following its introduction on March 26, 2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-UT, has introduced legislation aimed at nullifying the Henry Mountains and Fremont Gorge Travel Management Plan, a recent decree by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This bill, introduced on March 26, 2025, seeks to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from implementing any actions related to the decision record released in January 2025.

The bill responds to growing concerns among local stakeholders about the limitations placed on recreational activities and land use in these areas. Proponents argue that the previous management plan undermines access to public lands, affecting outdoor enthusiasts, local businesses, and residents who rely on these areas for recreation and tourism. The push to overturn the plan signals a broader effort to promote more flexible land management policies that prioritize access and economic activity over restrictive regulations.

Opponents of the plan assert that it was designed to safeguard the fragile ecosystems of the Henry Mountains and Fremont Gorge, which are valued for their unique wildlife and geological features. They argue that nullifying the management plan could exacerbate environmental degradation, potentially impacting both local flora and fauna.

Maloy's bill indicates a growing divide in Congress regarding how public lands should be managed. If passed, it could set a precedent for reversing similar management plans across the country and reflect a shift in priorities towards more liberal approaches to land use. The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration. The outcome may influence the balance of land use policies and environmental protections in the region as lawmakers grapple with competing interests.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian Mast, R-FL, has introduced the National Garden for America’s 250th Anniversary Act, a proposal aimed at commemorating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the United States. The legislation seeks to establish the National Garden of American Heroes, a statuary park dedicated to honoring individuals who have shaped American history.

The bill was introduced in anticipation of the nation’s milestone anniversary and seeks to create a lasting tribute that celebrates historical figures. This initiative is part of a broader effort by the White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday, which aims to engage citizens in recognizing the accomplishments and contributions of diverse individuals across history. If enacted, the Garden is expected to enhance cultural and educational opportunities, serving as a space for reflection and learning.

The legislation sets an ambitious timeline, requiring that construction of the Garden commence by July 4, 2026, contingent on approval from the Secretary of the Interior regarding its location. Notably, the bill allows the Task Force to acquire land from various sources, including state and local governments, or private landowners if federal land is unavailable. 

In addition to honoring individuals, the preservation of the Garden will be funded through public and private contributions, emphasizing community involvement and investment in the project. The establishment of a National Garden Fund is also included in the proposal to handle expenses and maintenance, potentially including visitation fees should the need arise.

As the nation approaches this pivotal anniversary, the National Garden for America’s 250th Anniversary Act represents a significant step towards building a monument that honors the diverse heroes who have forged America’s path.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mary E. Miller, R-IL, has introduced the Defining Male and Female Act of 2025, aiming to establish clear biological definitions of male and female for federal legislation. The bill seeks to enshrine into law specific definitions of terms related to sex and gender, reflecting traditional biological concepts.

The introduction of this legislation comes amid ongoing debates over gender identity and the definitions of biological sex in legal contexts. Proponents argue that establishing unambiguous definitions will help maintain clarity in legislation regarding rights and protections under federal law. The bill emphasizes that sex should be classified strictly as either male or female, based on biological reproduction characteristics, thereby dismissing gender identity as a basis for legal recognition.

The potential impact of the bill could be significant, affecting policies across various federal agencies, including education, healthcare, and employment. Critics of the bill, however, argue that it may undermine the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals by failing to acknowledge their identity and lived experiences. They contend that such definitions could lead to discrimination and exclusion in key areas where gender recognition is increasingly considered important for rights and protections.

This legislation represents a broader movement among some lawmakers to reinforce traditional definitions of gender in response to evolving societal understandings. With the bill currently referred to the House Judiciary Committee, its future will depend on the political climate within Congress and the public's reaction to its implications. Advocates for LGBTQ+ rights are mobilizing against the bill, highlighting concerns about its potential ramifications on civil rights and personal freedoms.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Barry Moore, R-AL, has introduced the Farmers’ Market Expansion Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. The legislation seeks to include tree nuts, including shelled tree nuts, in the Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, enhancing food accessibility for older Americans.

The act responds to a pressing demand to broaden the types of fresh produce available at farmers' markets, particularly for seniors who rely on these nutrition programs for healthy food options. By including tree nuts, the legislation aims to improve the dietary quality of participating seniors, addressing nutritional gaps common in older demographics. Tree nuts are known for their health benefits, including heart health and reduced chronic disease risk, making them a valuable addition to seniors' diets.

The potential impact of this initiative is significant, as it could lead to increased consumption of tree nuts among seniors, thereby supporting better health outcomes. Additionally, this measure aligns with efforts to support local farmers by providing a market for tree nuts, thus benefiting the agricultural sector and local economies.

Historically, the Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program has aimed to provide low-income seniors with access to fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, enhancing their nutrition. The inclusion of tree nuts represents a progressive step in diversifying the types of food available to those in need. As food systems face ongoing challenges, diversifying options can play a crucial role in food security and public health.

The Farmers’ Market Expansion Act has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture for further deliberation. Rep. Moore's initiative reflects a growing understanding of the importance of nutrition in promoting health and wellness among the elderly population.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Nathaniel Moran, R-TX, has introduced the Building Youth Workforce Skills Act, aimed at enhancing job training opportunities for youth aged 16 to 21. The bill seeks to amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to allow the use of individual training accounts for eligible in-school and out-of-school youths.

The initiative responds to the growing need for effective workforce development strategies, particularly in the wake of economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many young individuals are facing barriers to accessing job training and skill development. By facilitating the use of individual training accounts, the proposed bill aims to provide financial flexibility, enabling youths to select customized training programs with qualified providers.

The potential impact of this legislation is significant, as it endeavors to empower young people by equipping them with relevant skills that meet the demands of a rapidly evolving job market. This could lead to increased employability and career advancement opportunities, ultimately fostering stronger economic growth in communities across the country.

Historically, workforce training programs have been underutilized by youths, with many lacking awareness of available resources. By establishing individual training accounts, the Building Youth Workforce Skills Act would not only streamline access to training but also promote better engagement from young participants. It aligns with broader workforce development goals by ensuring that youth are adequately prepared to join a workforce increasingly reliant on specialized skills and certifications.

The House Committee on Education and Workforce is set to review the bill, with advocates pushing for swift action to implement the reforms. As the job landscape continues to evolve, ensuring that the next generation possesses the necessary skills is more critical than ever.

The SCREENS for Cancer Act comes in response to alarming statistics that project over 319,750 new cases of invasive breast cancer and nearly 43,000 related deaths in 2025. In addition, 13,360 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and 4,320 deaths from cervical cancer are anticipated. Founded in 1991, the NBCCEDP has played a critical role in providing lifesaving cancer screenings to underserved communities, reaching over 6.4 million individuals and facilitating more than 16.5 million screening exams. 

This legislation proposes significant program expansions and updates to address barriers that vulnerable populations face when seeking care. By implementing evidence-based strategies to improve outreach, the program aims to enhance cancer screening rates, specifically focusing on women who are geographically or culturally isolated. The revisions include augmenting follow-up services, improving access to screenings, and reducing disparities in cancer outcomes. 

The bill emphasizes the importance of early detection, with rescreening expected to lead to more cancers being identified at earlier, more treatable stages. By reauthorizing the NBCCEDP, the SCREENS for Cancer Act aims to prolong lives and advance health equity, ensuring all women have equal access to necessary services. The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2382",40434,"Rep. Murphy Introduces First Responders Retirement Parity Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gregory F. Murphy, R-NC, has introduced the First Responders Retirement Parity Act, a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to extend pension plan eligibility to certain firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics. This initiative is designed to ensure that these essential workers receive the same retirement benefits as their counterparts in other public safety roles.

The First Responders Retirement Parity Act responds to a noticeable disparity faced by emergency responders who have been excluded from certain governmental pension plans. By broadening the definition of governmental plan, the bill seeks to include public safety agency employees whose primary duties involve providing emergency response services. This change is anticipated to enhance the retirement security of these workers, acknowledging their critical contributions to public safety.

The context for this legislation stems from the increasing recognition of the demanding and often dangerous work performed by first responders. Many have expressed concerns over the adequacy of benefits currently provided, which can fail to meet the long-term needs of those who dedicate their lives to protecting communities. By expanding access to pension plans, the bill aims to align retirement benefits with the nature of the job.

If enacted, the First Responders Retirement Parity Act could significantly impact the lives of thousands of current and retired first responders, providing them with crucial financial support as they transition out of active service. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Education and Workforce and Ways and Means for further consideration. This legislative move comes amidst wider discussions about the need to reinforce and support those in public service, particularly as the nation navigates ongoing challenges in emergency response and disaster management.

The bill (H.R. 2382) introduced on 03/26/2025 has 7 co-sponsors: Rep. Foxx, Virginia [R-NC-5]...03/26/2025; Rep. Hudson, Richard [R-NC-9]...03/26/2025; Rep. Rouzer, David [R-NC-7]...03/26/2025; Rep.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2383",40434,"Rep. Neguse Introduces Protecting Kids from Fentanyl Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joe Neguse, D-CO, has introduced the Protecting Kids from Fentanyl Act, a critical piece of legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis among school-aged children. This bill seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act by allowing the use of Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants for purchasing life-saving opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, for schools. It also mandates the provision of training for staff on administering these medications and raising fentanyl awareness among students.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to a nationwide surge in opioid-related overdoses, especially among teens. As fentanyl has proliferated, schools have found themselves unprepared to address potential drug-related emergencies. By equipping schools with opioid antagonists and providing education, the legislation aims to save lives and foster a safer environment for students.

The potential impact of the Protecting Kids from Fentanyl Act is significant. With increased access to naloxone in schools, trained personnel will be ready to respond swiftly to overdose incidents. Additionally, integrating fentanyl awareness into school curricula will educate students about the dangers of drug use. This proactive approach could dramatically decrease the number of opioid-related fatalities in educational settings to protect the most vulnerable populations.

The bill addresses a pressing health crisis and represents a collaborative effort among lawmakers to tackle drug addiction and its consequences in communities. As it moves to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for review, supporters are optimistic about its chances of passage, especially amid growing public concern over the opioid epidemic's effects on youth.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Ogles, R-TN, has introduced the Make Education Great Again Act, aimed at improving educational outcomes by empowering parents, states, and local communities. The bill seeks to reduce federal oversight in education, giving more control back to families and local authorities.

The introduction of this legislation comes in response to growing concerns over federal mandates that critics argue have hindered parental choice and local governance in education. Ogles asserts that the current federal approach has led to a decrease in educational quality and accountability, emphasizing the need for reforms that allow parents to make decisions regarding their children's education. 

The proposed act emphasizes parental rights and seeks to ameliorate the relationship between federal and local education systems. It includes provisions for the Secretary of Education to ensure federal funds support local initiatives rather than bureaucratic regulations. The bill also proposes to promote school choice options, such as educational savings accounts and charter schools, and aims to reduce administrative burdens on state educational systems.

Moreover, this legislation is seen as a pivotal step towards restoring educational decision-making at the community level. By attempting to dismantle what proponents view as excessive federal control, the bill has generated significant interest across the political spectrum. Advocates believe that allowing local authorities to craft their educational policies will foster innovation and improve academic results.

In addition to placing a stronger emphasis on parental authority, the bill's framework sets out guidelines for spending within education programs without mandating new federal expenditures. As the bill moves to the Committee on Education and Workforce, its success may hinge on bipartisan support amid ongoing debates about educational governance in America.

"$H billintroh-250326-hr2387",40434,"Rep. Onder Introduces No Harm Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Robert Onder, R-MO, has introduced the No Harm Act in the House of Representatives, aiming to prohibit federal funding for sex-trait altering treatments for minors. The bill is designed to restrict the allocation of funds for medical procedures that seek to alter a minor's biological sex characteristics and aims to ensure that parents retain ultimate authority over health decisions for their children.

The introduction of the No Harm Act comes amid a growing national debate over gender identity and medical treatments for youth. Proponents of the bill argue that minors may not be fully equipped to make such significant decisions regarding their health, particularly when it comes to irreversible treatments. The bill outlines specific prohibitions on federal funding that would support sex-trait altering treatments and includes provisions allowing parents to decline such treatments for their children.

This legislative effort could have substantial implications, impacting medical institutions, including hospitals and clinics, that currently provide such treatments. By cutting off federal funds to entities offering these services, the bill aims to create a disincentive for medical professionals to administer procedures that alter a child's sex traits.

Additionally, the proposed legislation empowers parents with the right to make healthcare choices for their underage children and mandates that parental consent is obtained before any sex-trait altering procedure can be administered. The bill also stresses the importance of informed consent, requiring healthcare providers to give parents detailed information regarding potential risks associated with treatments.

As the No Harm Act moves through the legislative process, it highlights the contentious atmosphere surrounding healthcare regulations for minors, with advocates on both sides eager to see its impact on medical practices and parental rights across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Randall, D-WA, has introduced the Quinault Indian Nation Land Transfer Act, aimed at placing approximately 72 acres of land in Washington State into trust for the Quinault Indian Nation. This legislation seeks to enhance the tribe’s land base amid ongoing efforts to affirm their rights and sovereignty.

The bill serves as a response to the Quinault Indian Nation’s long-standing request for additional land to be recognized as part of their reservation. Recognizing and transferring the land into trust status aims to improve the tribe's ability to manage natural resources, develop infrastructure, and create economic opportunities without the constraints typically imposed by state laws. It will be administered by the Department of the Interior, ensuring adherence to federal regulations governing trust lands for recognized Indian tribes.

This initiative comes at a time when many Indigenous communities are advocating for greater autonomy and access to land—critical elements needed for cultural preservation and economic sustainability. By taking this step, the Quinault Indian Nation stands to strengthen its community and expand its capabilities in resource management.

The bill explicitly prohibits the land from being used for gaming purposes, emphasizing its intended use for residential, cultural, and environmental benefits rather than as a source of casino revenue. Furthermore, it ensures that existing treaty rights remain untouched, highlighting a commitment to maintaining the tribe's historical legal agreements with the federal government.

Randall's introduction of this bill illustrates a significant progression in Native American rights and land trust issues, which have been at the forefront of legislative discussions aimed at rectifying historical injustices against Indigenous peoples. The proposed law awaits further deliberation in the House Committee on Natural Resources, where it will undergo review and potentially advance toward enactment.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Patrick Ryan, D-NY, has introduced the Strengthening Supply Chains Through Truck Driver Incentives Act of 2025, aimed at bolstering the trucking industry by offering a refundable tax credit to commercial truck drivers. This legislation responds to an ongoing shortage of drivers, aiming to attract new talent while supporting existing truck operators amid rising operational costs.

The bill proposes a $7,500 tax credit for qualified truck drivers, with enhanced benefits for new entrants into the profession. To qualify, individuals must hold a valid Class A commercial driver’s license and meet specified income thresholds. They must also demonstrate a commitment of at least 1,900 hours driving in a tax year, or meet modified criteria if new to trucking. By providing financial incentives, the legislation seeks to alleviate barriers for eligible applicants, including those completing apprenticeship programs.

Recent supply chain disruptions have highlighted the pivotal role of trucking in maintaining the flow of goods, with many companies facing delays due to the lack of qualified drivers. According to industry reports, the trucking sector is experiencing an estimated shortfall of up to 80,000 drivers. This shortage is contributing to increased shipping costs and longer delivery times, affecting consumers and businesses alike. 

By incentivizing careers in trucking, Rep. Ryan's bill could stabilize supply chains, ensuring that goods reach markets efficiently. The narrative surrounding the workforce challenge in logistics underscores the need for innovative policy solutions aimed at fostering a robust labor force capable of meeting the demands of a dynamic economy. The proposal is currently awaiting review by the House Committee on Ways and Means.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2395",40434,"Rep. Clyde Introduces SHORT Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-GA, has introduced the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, commonly referred to as the SHORT Act. This legislation aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to redefine firearms, specifically removing short-barreled rifles and shotguns from the National Firearms Act's classification of regulated firearms. 

The introduction of the SHORT Act comes amid ongoing debates surrounding gun ownership rights and regulations in the U.S. Supporters argue that the bill seeks to alleviate unnecessary burdens on lawful gun owners, particularly those who possess short-barreled weapons for sporting and personal defense. Currently, these firearms require specific taxes and registration processes under the National Firearms Act, which many believe are overly stringent.

By altering the classification, the bill suggests that individuals who acquire or possess short-barreled rifles and shotguns would no longer face federal registration or licensing burdens, significantly simplifying ownership. This move could potentially lead to increased sales in the firearms market and greater accessibility for recreational weapon enthusiasts.

The SHORT Act also proposes to preempt certain state regulations and taxes on short-barreled firearms, further emphasizing individual ownership rights over state-imposed restrictions. This presents a contentious issue, particularly in states with stringent gun control laws, as it may conflict with local regulations designed to manage weapon ownership effectively.

Clyde's bill reflects a broader trend among certain lawmakers advocating for reduced firearm regulations, framing the conversation around personal freedom and constitutionally-protected rights. As the bill moves to the House Ways and Means and Judiciary Committees for further consideration, its potential impacts on both local and federal firearm regulations remain to be seen, highlighting a continuing divide in American gun policy discourse.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2396",40434,"Rep. Vasquez Introduces Honor Farmer Contracts Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Honor Farmer Contracts Act, aiming to unfreeze funding for agricultural contracts and prevent the closure of critical resources for farmers. This legislation addresses issues arising from funding disruptions at the Department of Agriculture, ensuring that all agreements made prior to the bill's enactment are honored, and that farmers receive payments they are owed.

The Honor Farmer Contracts Act was introduced in response to growing concerns within the agriculture community about financial instability due to stalled funding. The repercussions of these disruptions have left many farmers and agricultural entities vulnerable. With essential services and resources at risk of being diminished, this legislation seeks to safeguard the interests of those in agricultural sectors by mandating the immediate release of funds and the adherence to existing contracts.

Further, the bill stipulates that the Department of Agriculture cannot cancel any signed agreements with farmers unless the terms have not been met. This measure aims to provide farmers with greater security, allowing them to plan and operate without the fear of losing vital support. Additionally, the legislation prohibits the closure of local Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service offices unless Congress is given proper notice and justification at least 60 days in advance.

As the agricultural sector faces challenges from various fronts, including climate change and economic pressures, the Honor Farmer Contracts Act represents a proactive approach to ensuring that farmers are supported and can continue to contribute to the nation’s food security. The bill has garnered attention from farming advocates who view it as a crucial step in stabilizing the agricultural industry amidst uncertain times.

"$H billintroh-250327-hr2398",40434,"Rep. Smith Introduces Rural Veterinary Workforce Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adrian Smith, R-NE, has introduced the Rural Veterinary Workforce Act, aiming to enhance access to veterinary services, particularly in rural areas, by exempting certain loan repayment assistance from taxable income. This proposed legislation, introduced on March 27, 2025, seeks to address the ongoing shortage of veterinarians serving rural communities, a gap that has been increasingly recognized as a significant barrier to livestock health and animal care.

The Rural Veterinary Workforce Act proposes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, specifically providing tax relief for those participating in state loan repayment or forgiveness programs aimed at increasing veterinary service availability in underserved regions. This initiative reflects concerns about the aging veterinary workforce and the challenges young graduates face when considering rural practice due to high educational debt.

The bill is expected to have a substantial impact on recruitment and retention of veterinarians in rural areas, which often struggle to attract qualified professionals. By alleviating the financial burden from loans, the act plans to incentivize more graduates to consider careers in these critical, yet underserved, markets. 

As the number of practicing veterinarians continues to dwindle, especially in regions with a high agricultural focus, the legislation has drawn bipartisan support with co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, highlighting the collective recognition of this pressing issue.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN, has introduced the Rural Broadband Protection Act, aiming to establish a vetting process for applicants seeking high-cost universal service program funding from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This legislation seeks to enhance accountability and streamline the delivery of broadband services in rural areas, ensuring that only qualified providers can access federal resources for infrastructure projects.

The Rural Broadband Protection Act responds to ongoing concerns about the efficacy of federal funding intended to bridge the digital divide in underserved communities. With many rural areas still lacking reliable internet access, the bill addresses the pressing need for improved oversight on how federal funds are allocated and utilized. By implementing a thorough vetting process, this legislation aims to prevent past issues where funds were awarded to entities with inadequate plans or capabilities to follow through on their promises.

Under the proposed legislation, the FCC would be required to initiate a rulemaking proceeding within 180 days to outline this vetting process. This would involve a detailed evaluation of applicant qualifications, including their technical, financial, and operational competencies, as well as their business plan for successfully deploying broadband networks. 

The impact of this bill could be significant, potentially leading to more effective use of federal funding and ultimately enhancing internet access in remote areas. By enforcing stringent qualifications, the Rural Broadband Protection Act endeavors to ensure that those receiving government assistance are both capable and committed to delivering reliable services. This could mark a vital step forward in addressing the disparities in broadband access that persist across the nation, especially in rural populations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-CA, has introduced the Pit River Land Transfer Act, a bill aimed at transferring federal land in California to the Pit River Tribe for their benefit. This measure would officially take approximately 583.79 acres of land, known as the Four Corners Federal land, into trust, acknowledging the Tribe's historical connection to the territory.

The introduction of this bill addresses long-standing issues about tribal land rights and sovereignty, particularly concerning the Four Corners area, which has deep historical significance for the Pit River Tribe. This initiative seeks to rectify past injustices by affirming the Tribe's rights to land that has been part of their ancestral heritage. By placing this land into trust, the federal government acknowledges the Tribe's ongoing relationship with the area and aims to foster economic and cultural development.

Upon approval, the designated land will be administered according to regulations applicable to federally recognized tribal properties. However, an important stipulation of the bill is that it explicitly prohibits the land from being used for gaming purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, ensuring that the transfer is focused on preservation and cultural initiatives rather than commercial gambling operations.

The Pit River Tribe has long been advocating for the return of their ancestral lands, and this legislative action could pave the way for further cooperation between the Tribe and federal authorities. The bill reflects a growing recognition of indigenous sovereignty and aims to promote the restoration of tribal lands, aligning federal policies with the aspirations of Native American communities across the country.

As the bill moves to the House Committee on Natural Resources, it will undergo further scrutiny and discussion, reflecting the commitment to honoring tribal rights and fostering meaningful governmental relationships.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-CA, has introduced the No Hungry Kids in Schools Act, aimed at enhancing food accessibility in schools across the nation. This bill proposes to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to establish statewide community eligibility for certain special assistance payments, ensuring that all eligible students receive free meals.

The act was motivated by growing concerns over food insecurity among school-aged children, particularly in low-income areas where students often rely on school meals for their daily nutrition. Aguilar highlighted that the initiative seeks to bridge the gap for families struggling to provide adequate meals, particularly amidst rising living costs and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If enacted, this legislation would allow states to implement a statewide community eligibility program, which would enable local educational agencies to receive full reimbursement for meals served to all students, regardless of income. This universal approach is expected to reduce administrative burdens and ensure that no child goes hungry at school. 

Furthermore, the bill aims to enhance nutritional standards by encouraging the use of locally sourced foods, which would not only benefit student health but also support local farmers and economies. Impact studies suggest that such initiatives can lead to improved educational outcomes and long-term health benefits for children.

The No Hungry Kids in Schools Act has garnered support from a diverse coalition of representatives, reflecting a bipartisan recognition of the need to address childhood hunger. As this bill moves to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, advocates anticipate extensive discussions on its potential ramifications and the need for robust funding to support its goals.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA, has introduced the TELL Act, which aims to enhance transparency regarding the storage of user data in the People’s Republic of China. This legislation mandates that any website or mobile application that collects user information and stores it in China must explicitly disclose this to users, including whether data is accessible by the Chinese Communist Party or state-owned entities.

The introduction of the TELL Act comes amid growing concerns about data security and privacy, reflecting apprehensions about foreign access to American users' data. Recent incidents involving data hacks and breaches have heightened awareness of the risks associated with data storage in countries with different cybersecurity laws. By requiring clear disclosures, the bill seeks to empower consumers with knowledge about where their data is held and who can access it.

If passed, the TELL Act will impose specific responsibilities on tech companies, compelling them to inform users in a clear and conspicuous manner about the location of their data. This measure is designed not only to protect user privacy but also to deter companies from using deceptive practices regarding data disclosures. Noncompliance would make violations subject to existing regulations under the Federal Trade Commission's authority, ensuring that consumer protection standards are upheld.

The TELL Act reflects ongoing legislative efforts to address data security concerns amid increasing dependence on digital services in everyday life. It may also prompt tech companies to reconsider their data storage practices, potentially influencing how user data is managed globally. As the bill advances to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, further discussions will shape its future and the potential impact on consumer data rights.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Mental Health Access Improvement Act, aimed at increasing access to mental health services across the United States. The bill seeks to enhance funding for community-based mental health programs and expand telehealth services for individuals in underserved areas, recognizing the growing mental health crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The urgency behind this legislation stems from alarming statistics showing a significant rise in mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. Many Americans, particularly in rural and low-income communities, continue to face barriers in accessing necessary mental health care, such as limited provider availability and high costs. In response, the Mental Health Access Improvement Act proposes to allocate federal resources to train more mental health professionals and support local organizations committed to mental health outreach.

This bill not only emphasizes funding but also calls for the integration of mental health services into primary care settings. By encouraging a collaborative approach between mental health practitioners and primary care providers, the intent is to promote early intervention and streamline the path to treatment for individuals suffering from mental health issues.

With the potential impact of this bill being substantial, advocates argue that improving access could lead to better health outcomes and reduce the burden of untreated mental conditions on the healthcare system. As mental health awareness grows, stakeholders are increasingly advocating for policy changes that prioritize mental health parity with physical health.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Riley Moore, R-WV, has introduced the Respect Parents’ Childcare Choices Act, a legislative measure aimed at reauthorizing the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and enhancing support for relative caregivers. This bill focuses on expanding access to childcare options while emphasizing the importance of parental choice in selecting childcare providers.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to ongoing concerns about the limited availability of affordable and flexible childcare options across the United States, particularly for families relying on relatives for care. As many parents juggle work and family responsibilities, the legislation seeks to alleviate the challenges they face in accessing quality childcare services. By extending financial assistance options and recognizing the role of family caregivers, the bill aims to empower parents in their childcare decisions.

Key components of the Act include increased funding authorization—set at $14 billion annually for the years 2026 through 2031—and provisions to streamline access to childcare certificates for parents. This reauthorization would allow families to utilize these certificates for services from relatives, including grandparents and adult siblings, further legitimizing in-home care and fostering support networks among families. 

In addition to these changes, the act is expected to enhance protections and improve the quality of care through measures that review existing requirements and eliminate barriers that discourage relative caregiving. Critics argue that stringent regulations hinder families from accessing informal care networks, making it vital for policymakers to address these regulations.

As the bill progresses through the House Committees on Education and Workforce and Ways and Means, stakeholders anticipate that it could pave the way for a more inclusive and accessible childcare framework, ultimately benefiting families nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Thompson, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Incentive Act, aimed at promoting renewable energy adoption through financial incentives for both individuals and businesses. This legislation is designed to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy future by providing tax credits for solar, wind, and other renewable energy installations.

The Clean Energy Incentive Act was introduced in response to growing concerns about climate change and the urgent need for a comprehensive strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With many states experiencing adverse effects from climate-related events, such as wildfires and floods, the bill seeks to encourage investment in clean energy technologies as a viable solution. The financial incentives outlined in the proposal are intended to make these technologies more accessible and affordable for consumers, thereby increasing their widespread adoption.

Under the provisions of the bill, homeowners who install energy-efficient systems will receive significant tax credits, while businesses that invest in renewable energy infrastructure will benefit from deductions aimed at offsetting the costs associated with these investments.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-IN, has introduced the Reduce Bureaucracy to Uplift Families Act, which aims to streamline funds for temporary assistance programs designed to support needy families. The bill seeks to limit the percentage of funds allocated for administrative expenses within the program of block grants to states, effectively redirecting more resources towards direct family support.

This legislative effort responds to ongoing concerns about inefficiencies within social welfare systems. Reports indicate that a significant portion of funds designated for family assistance programs has been diverted to administrative costs, often hindering the program's effectiveness in providing immediate relief to those in need. By reducing the allowable administrative expenses from 15% to 10%, the bill intends to ensure that a greater share of funding reaches families experiencing financial difficulties.

The implications of the Reduce Bureaucracy to Uplift Families Act are substantial. Advocates argue that the reallocation of funds could lead to an increase in support services, such as case management, that help families establish individual responsibility plans tailored to their needs. This change could enhance the program's overall success in aiding families, potentially resulting in improved economic stability for many struggling households.

Introduced on March 24, 2025, and referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, the bill marks a critical step towards reforming social welfare initiatives. As discussions around the legislation unfold, it remains to be seen how it will navigate the complex landscape of fiscal policy and social services, but its focus on reducing bureaucratic overhead indicates a renewed commitment to prioritizing familial support and empowerment in federal assistance programs.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tim Burchett, R-TN, has introduced the American Genetic Privacy Act, aimed at safeguarding genetic information by prohibiting its disclosure to the People’s Republic of China. Unveiled on March 24, 2025, this legislation responds to growing concerns about data privacy and national security in an era where genetic information is increasingly commodified.

The bill highlights the risks associated with the sale and sharing of genetic data, particularly regarding its potential misuse if acquired by foreign entities, especially those linked to China. In light of recent reports exposing vulnerabilities in data handling by commercial DNA testing services, Burchett’s initiative seeks to impose strict regulations on these entities to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive genetic information.

Under the proposed legislation, individuals and entities will be barred from selling or offering to sell genetic data to the Chinese government or any organization under its control. Additionally, commercial DNA testing services will be prohibited from disclosing any genetic information collected from users whether in raw or aggregated forms. This effort aims to establish a framework of accountability and transparency within an industry often marked by lax privacy practices.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-OR, has introduced the Protecting Families from Inflation Act, aimed at addressing the economic pressures that many households are facing due to increasing inflation rates linked to U.S. tariffs on imported goods. The bill requires the Federal Reserve to conduct a detailed study on how these tariffs have impacted consumer prices and small businesses.

The act responds to growing concerns among constituents regarding rising costs of living, as many families find it increasingly difficult to manage their budgets amid inflationary pressures. By mandating a comprehensive analysis, the legislation intends to provide lawmakers with essential data that could guide future tariff policies, potentially leading to measures that alleviate financial strain on American families.

The primary component of this bill involves a report that the Federal Reserve must submit within 270 days, summarizing the collective impact of all U.S. tariffs imposed since 2017. This includes scrutinizing price changes in goods and services directly affected by these tariffs. Supporters argue that understanding this dynamic is crucial for formulating effective economic strategies that promote stability and affordability.

In a wider context, the Protecting Families from Inflation Act aligns with ongoing debates over trade policies and their ramifications on everyday Americans. With inflation consistently pressing down on disposable incomes, the bill symbolizes a proactive approach by lawmakers to ensure that tariff strategies do not exacerbate financial hardships.

As this bill moves forward, it will likely be watched closely by both economic analysts and constituents whose livelihoods depend on the outcomes of tariff-related policies.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Earl L. Buddy Carter, R-GA, has introduced the Common Sense Air Regulations Act, a bill aiming to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) finalized rule concerning the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter. This legislation was introduced on March 24, 2025, and has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further consideration.

This bill stems from concerns among certain legislators regarding the implications of the EPA's new air quality standards, which they argue may impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on industries.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Earl L. Buddy Carter, R-GA, recently introduced the Proportional Reviews for Broadband Deployment Act, aimed at streamlining the regulatory process for expanding broadband infrastructure across the country. The proposal seeks to exempt certain facilities requests from environmental and historical review requirements, thereby accelerating the deployment of wireless technology.

The bill specifically targets the lengthy approval processes that currently affect broadband initiatives under the Middle-Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Proponents argue that these reviews can significantly delay essential projects, which are increasingly critical in today's digital economy. By simplifying the review process for eligible facilities, the act is expected to facilitate quicker access to high-speed internet, particularly in underserved rural areas.

Carter's introduction of the legislation comes against a backdrop of growing demand for enhanced broadband connectivity, driven by the rise in remote work and online education spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry advocates believe the measure will help bridge the digital divide, particularly for communities that suffer from limited internet access due to regulatory hurdles.

The bill has been referred to both the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources, indicating its potential influence on energy and environmental policies related to telecommunications. As legislators gather feedback and gauge support, the act may set a precedent for how the federal government balances infrastructure development with environmental protection.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Byron Donalds, R-FL, introduced the Gift Accountability, Reporting, and Disclosures Act (GARD Act) on March 24, 2025, aimed at enhancing transparency in the acceptance and reporting of foreign gifts by federal employees. This legislation seeks to amend existing regulations governing the reporting of foreign gifts and decorations, thereby strengthening ethical guidelines within government agencies.

The GARD Act arises amid growing concerns about foreign influence in U.S. politics, emphasizing the need for stringent regulations to combat potential corruption. By mandating federal agencies to compile and submit comprehensive reports to the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of State, the legislation aims to establish a uniform approach to the acceptance and disclosure of foreign gifts, ensuring that all government employees adhere to ethical standards.

Under the proposed framework, federal employees will be required to provide detailed information regarding the nature and value of gifts received, along with their final disposition. The act includes immediate repercussions for non-compliance, imposing a monetary penalty for late submissions. This structure is designed to discourage the acceptance of gifts from countries deemed as threats to national interests, thereby reinforcing the integrity of public service.

The introduction of the GARD Act highlights a proactive legislative effort addressing the intersection of ethics and governance in a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. If enacted, the bill will not only align with best practices for transparency but also enhance public trust in government operations.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Scott H. Peters, D-CA, has introduced the Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, aiming to strengthen the integrity of healthcare programs by implementing rigorous provider screening measures. 

The bill, presented in the House on March 24, 2025, proposes amendments to the Social Security Act, specifically targeting the Medicaid program. It mandates that states conduct additional checks of the Death Master File—a federal database used to confirm the death status of individuals—during the enrollment and revalidation of Medicaid providers. This requirement will be initiated starting January 1, 2027, and states will need to continue these checks on a quarterly basis for providers throughout their enrollment period.

The introduction of this bill follows ongoing concerns regarding fraud within Medicare and Medicaid systems, which cost taxpayers billions annually. By requiring thorough verification of a provider’s status, the legislation seeks to prevent deceased individuals from remaining listed as active providers, thereby reducing opportunities for fraudulent claims.

Should this bill advance, its potential impacts are significant. Enhanced screening processes are expected to improve the efficiency and security of Medicaid services, ultimately safeguarding both public funds and patient welfare. This legislative effort comes as part of a broader strategy to uphold accountability in health care practices amidst rising fraud cases nationwide.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Joe Wilson, R-SC, has introduced the Pakistan Democracy Act, proposing sanctions against foreign individuals involved in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents in Pakistan. The bill aims to support democratic processes in Pakistan, emphasizing the need for free and fair elections alongside the restoration of judicial independence.

The Pakistan Democracy Act was prompted by ongoing reports of political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan, especially concerning the treatment of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and other opposition figures. By imposing targeted sanctions, including visa restrictions, the U.S. seeks to deter and hold accountable those responsible for undermining democracy and rule of law in the country.

If enacted, this legislation would require the Secretary of State to identify and sanction specific individuals engaging in political persecution within 180 days of the bill's passage. The act also allows for a presidential waiver of sanctions under specific conditions, such as the restoration of civilian rule and the release of political detainees. This reflects a strategic approach for U.S. foreign policy aimed at promoting democracy while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changes on the ground in Pakistan.

The introduction of this bill follows years of increasing international scrutiny over Pakistan’s political landscape, characterized by military influence and political unrest. Supporters of the legislation argue that it is vital for the U.S. to prioritize democratic values and human rights in its foreign relations. The bill has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee for further consideration. If successful, it could signify a pivotal shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding Pakistan and democratic governance in the region.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Womack, R-AR, has introduced the Tipped Employee Protection Act aimed at amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The bill seeks to redefine the term “tipped employee” to better reflect the modern workplace and enhance protections for workers in service industries who rely significantly on tips for their income.

The legislation responds to long-standing debates about the treatment of tipped employees, particularly regarding wage levels and benefits. Many service workers, including servers and bartenders, often receive a substantial portion of their earnings through tips, leading to inconsistent income and financial instability. By revising the definition, the bill aims to ensure that these employees receive cash wages that, when combined with tips, meet or exceed the federal minimum wage.

This change reflects a growing recognition of the challenges faced by tipped employees, particularly during economic fluctuations or downturns such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporters believe that clearer definitions will not only protect these workers but also improve compliance among employers regarding wage laws.

The proposed legislation could have far-reaching impacts by potentially increasing the minimum wage applicable to tipped employees and providing them with better financial security. Proponents argue that raising the floor for tipped wages aligns with broader efforts to support low-income workers and reduce income inequality.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will undergo scrutiny and debate in the House Education and Workforce Committee. Should it pass, the Tipped Employee Protection Act may pave the way for significant reforms in how tipped workers are compensated in the United States, a topic that remains contentious among lawmakers and the public alike.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-TN, has introduced the Mobility Means Freedom Tax Credit Act aimed at providing financial relief to individuals purchasing mobility devices. This proposed legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to establish a refundable tax credit covering 50% of the costs incurred for various qualified mobility aids, including wheelchairs, scooters, and other assistive devices.

The initiative arises from growing concerns regarding the financial burden faced by those with mobility impairments. For many individuals, access to mobility devices can be prohibitive due to high costs, which can often create significant barriers to independence and quality of life. Cohen’s proposal aims to foster greater accessibility for individuals navigating these challenges by easing the financial impact of acquiring necessary equipment.

Under the terms of the bill, taxpayers would be eligible for the credit for up to three qualified mobility devices per tax year. This inclusion is designed to reflect the diverse needs of individuals requiring specialized equipment, as many may require more than one device or enhancements to existing ones. By implementing this tax credit, Cohen hopes to not only support those in need but also raise awareness about the importance of mobility aids in leading fuller lives.

The Mobility Means Freedom Tax Credit Act marks a significant step in the ongoing efforts to advocate for the rights and considerations of disabled individuals within the federal tax framework. As the bill advances through the legislative process, it is expected to garner support from various stakeholders committed to improving disability access across the nation. The measure has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further deliberation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-MI, has introduced the Central African Exploitation and Manipulation of American Companies Act (CEMAC Act) in response to regulatory concerns regarding the Central African Economic Monetary Community (CEMAC). The bill aims to withhold U.S. support for any actions taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) related to CEMAC states until their gross foreign exchange reserves are clearly defined.

The CEMAC Act comes amid increasing tension over foreign exchange regulations imposed by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), which require international oil companies to repatriate restoration funds earmarked for site rehabilitation. Critics argue that this regulation misrepresents these funds as foreign exchange reserves, a misclassification that could endanger billions of dollars in investments and severely impact the oil and gas sectors within those nations.

This legislation seeks to establish accountability by preventing U.S. representatives from supporting any IMF actions affecting CEMAC member states until clearer guidelines regarding these restoration funds are established. If passed, the CEMAC Act would potentially impact investment climates in Central Africa, which have already suffered, with Standard & Poor’s predicting significant reductions in government revenue and capital investment due to BEAC's new regulation.

Huizenga's initiative reflects a broader commitment to protecting U.S. economic interests abroad while emphasizing the importance of clear financial regulations that align with IMF standards. As oil and gas investments continue to dwindle, stakeholders are increasingly concerned that these regulatory changes could hinder necessary economic support for both American firms and CEMAC member states. The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on Financial Services.

A key element of the act mandates the Secretary of the Air Force to develop a strategy for transitioning to advanced aircraft and outlines requirements for ongoing procurement until all legacy systems are replaced. It also calls for a comprehensive study to assess the need for advanced-fighter procurement and the potential incorporation of unmanned capabilities. This thorough analysis is intended to provide a clear path forward for equipping both active and reserve components of the Air Force with the necessary tools for combat readiness.

By ensuring the sustained production of advanced fighters, the Air National Guard Squadron Preservation Act aims to enhance the readiness and capabilities of the Guard, ultimately strengthening the nation's defense posture. The legislation is set to undergo review by the House Committee on Armed Services, where its implications for national security and military strategy will be closely examined.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2329",40434,"Rep. Kelly Introduces Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Trent Kelly, R-MS, has introduced the Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act, aimed at extending nondiscriminatory treatment to products from Uzbekistan. This legislative move seeks to foster enhanced trade relations between the United States and Uzbekistan, potentially streamlining import processes and promoting economic collaboration.

The bill comes at a time when Uzbekistan has expressed a strong desire to integrate further into the global trade framework, especially as it aims for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). By lifting previous trade restrictions, the U.S. could support Uzbekistan's economic development while also gaining access to a unique market rich in natural resources and agricultural products.

Currently, Uzbekistan is limited under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, which imposes trade sanctions. The proposed bill would allow the President to determine that these restrictions no longer apply, thus paving the way for normalized trade relations. If passed, this legislation could significantly bolster trade volume between the two nations, benefiting U.S. businesses and creating jobs.

Trade experts advocate for this bill, highlighting that improved relations with Uzbekistan could yield substantial economic benefits. As Central Asia becomes increasingly significant to U.S. foreign policy, building these ties may not only foster stability but also create opportunities for U.S. exporters in agriculture, technology, and services, among other sectors.

With the legislation currently referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for review, its future will depend on bipartisan support. As discussions proceed, stakeholders from both the U.S. and Uzbekistan are optimistic about the potential impacts this bill may yield, marking a turning point in their diplomatic and economic relationship.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-GA, has introduced the Transparency in CFPB Cost-Benefit Analysis Act, aimed at enhancing the operational transparency of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This legislation requires more rigorous requirements for the bureau's rulemaking processes, outlining a comprehensive framework for analyzing the costs and benefits of proposed regulations.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing concerns over the CFPB's regulatory impact, especially amidst criticisms regarding the bureau's decision-making process. Proponents argue that the existing rules are often opaque, leading to potential overreach without sufficient justification or consideration of alternatives. By mandating detailed cost-benefit analyses and justifications for new rules, the bill seeks to ensure that the CFPB’s actions do not impose undue burdens on consumers and businesses, particularly small enterprises.

Key provisions of the legislation include requirements for CFPB to submit explicit justifications whenever costs for small businesses are projected to rise as a result of new regulations. It also emphasizes the need for assessing potential overlaps with existing regulations to mitigate duplications, thereby streamlining the regulatory environment.

The potential impact of the Transparency in CFPB Cost-Benefit Analysis Act could be far-reaching. Advocates believe that such scrutiny will foster a more balanced approach to regulation, encouraging the Bureau to consider market-driven solutions as viable. Furthermore, if passed, this legislation could lead to a decrease in unnecessary compliance costs, benefiting both consumers and businesses navigating an increasingly complex regulatory landscape.

With this measure now referred to the House Financial Services Committee, supporters hope it sparks a larger dialogue on regulatory reform and the overall function of the CFPB in safeguarding consumer financial interests.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tracey Mann, R-KS, has introduced the SHARE Act of 2025, aiming to enhance the sharing and use of criminal history record information among states for licensing purposes. The bill seeks to streamline the process of conducting background checks for individuals applying for professional licenses in states participating in interstate compacts.

The SHARE Act was initiated to address the growing needs for standardized background checks that recognize professional licenses across state lines. Currently, professionals often face bureaucratic delays due to inconsistent state requirements. By facilitating access to the National FBI criminal history records for state licensing authorities, the proposed legislation aims to create a more efficient process that could expedite licensing and job placement nationwide.

According to proponents of the SHARE Act, the measure is expected to significantly benefit individuals pursuing careers in fields like healthcare, education, and law enforcement, where timely certifications are critical. This bill would ensure that individuals seeking licenses can expedite their applications, thereby reducing gaps in employment and improving workforce participation.

The bill also prescribes strict guidelines for the usage of criminal history information, allowing states to access these records only for licensure purposes and barring them from sharing this data with unauthorized entities. This protective measure aims to balance the need for thorough vetting while safeguarding individual privacy rights.

Currently referred to the House Committees on Education and Workforce and the Judiciary, the SHARE Act has garnered bipartisan support, indicating a collaborative effort to address the complexities of professional licensing in an increasingly mobile workforce. If enacted, it could mark a significant step toward more uniform practices across states, enhancing job mobility for licensed professionals.

"$H billintroh-250325-hr2333",40434,"Rep. Mannion Introduces Protecting Students with Disabilities Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Mannion, D-NY, has introduced the Protecting Students with Disabilities Act, a legislative measure aimed at safeguarding the integrity of the Department of Education’s offices responsible for administering programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This bill seeks to ensure these offices remain intact, preventing any funding from being allocated to restructure or eliminate them.

The motivation behind the bill stems from concerns over potential administrative changes within the Department of Education that could disrupt services for students with disabilities. Rep. Mannion expressed a commitment to protecting the educational rights of these students, emphasizing that existing laws must be respected and upheld. The legislation explicitly prohibits the use of appropriated funds to dismantle or modify the operation of the Office of Special Education Programs.

By taking this legislative step, Mannion aims to reinforce Congressional intent regarding the education of children with disabilities, ensuring that specialized programs remain dedicated to this vital purpose. The proposed act will prevent any reassignments or changes in personnel that might undermine the current framework, which Congress regards as essential for effective education delivery.

If passed, the Protecting Students with Disabilities Act is expected to have a significant impact by maintaining a robust structure within the Department of Education that directly supports the needs of students requiring special education services. Advocates stress that such stability is crucial for fostering an inclusive educational environment, where students with disabilities can thrive.

Currently, the bill is under consideration in the House Education and Workforce Committee, with support from other representatives highlighting its importance in ensuring compliance with existing statutes governing special education programs.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act to transfer the authority for prosecuting violations of local laws from federal to district control. The proposed legislation aims to empower a local prosecutor’s office designated by D.C. law to oversee all prosecutions related to the district’s laws, allowing for more localized governance.

The introduction of this bill comes amid ongoing discussions about the autonomy of D.C. and the challenges of federal oversight. Currently, the U.S. Attorney General has jurisdiction over prosecutions in the district, often leading to frustrations regarding local governance. By transferring this responsibility to local prosecutors, the bill seeks to enhance accountability and relevance in legal proceedings that impact everyday residents.

If enacted, the bill would amend the D.C. Official Code, specifically Section 23-101, allowing local prosecutors to handle all municipal ordinances and penal statutes. This change is expected to improve the efficiency of legal proceedings and ensure that local conditions and community standards are more effectively represented in the prosecution of cases.

Furthermore, the act is intended to assure that federal employees transitioning to the new local office retain their federal benefits, contingent upon maintaining their employment status. This provision aims to ease the transition for current employees of the U.S. Attorney’s office, addressing concerns about job security and benefits amid significant organizational changes.

The District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act represents a significant shift in how legal enforcement is managed in the nation’s capital, potentially setting a precedent for greater local control over city governance and legal matters. As the bill moves forward, it will be evaluated by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform before possibly proceeding to a broader legislative vote.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the DIRECT Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at reallocating funds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to bolster resources for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Specifically, the bill proposes rescinding certain unallocated balances originally earmarked for IRS enforcement activities under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The introduction of the DIRECT Act comes in response to increasing concerns about border security and the need for enhanced law enforcement personnel at the southern border. The proposed bill reflects a growing bipartisan acknowledgment that customs enforcement may require more immediate financial support, especially in light of recent surges in migration and cross-border activities that have strained current resources.

By redirecting funds intended for the IRS, the legislation seeks to address urgent operational needs within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, allowing for the hiring of new agents and officers dedicated to safeguarding national borders. This measure underscores a shift in priorities among some lawmakers, focusing not only on tax enforcement but also on ensuring robust border security measures.

The potential impact of the DIRECT Act could be substantial, as it aims to provide immediate financial relief to federal agencies tasked with enforcing immigration laws. This could enhance their capacity to respond to and manage border security challenges more effectively.

As the bill moves to the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means, discussions will likely center on the feasibility and implications of shifting resources in this manner. The outcome of this legislative effort may influence future funding allocations for both the IRS and border security initiatives, reflecting the evolving landscape of federal spending priorities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, D-NY, has introduced the No Russian Tunnel to Crimea Act, a bill aimed at imposing sanctions on any foreign entity involved in the development of a tunnel or bridge that connects Russia to Crimea. The legislation is a direct response to ongoing geopolitical tensions following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its continued military operations in Ukraine.

The bill is part of a broader effort by U.S. lawmakers to deter foreign investment and support for Russia’s military ambitions. It specifically seeks to target those who knowingly participate in infrastructure projects that would further legitimize Russia’s claims to the disputed territory. This comes in light of reports suggesting collaboration between Russian and Chinese businesses to construct a tunnel between the Russian mainland and Crimea, which has raised alarms among U.S. officials.

The potential impacts of the legislation are significant. By imposing asset blocking measures and barring entry to individuals involved, the bill aims to isolate Russia economically and diplomatically. With the conflict in Ukraine persisting, lawmakers are keen on using all available measures to disrupt Russian supply lines and military access in Crimea, an area that has become crucial for Russian operations in the region. 

Furthermore, the legislation reinforces a commitment to uphold international law and Ukrainian sovereignty, reminding both allies and adversaries that the U.S. stands against any attempts to normalize Russian control over Crimea. By prioritizing sanctions against those complicit in Russian infrastructure projects, the bill seeks to reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine while acting as a deterrent against further Russian aggression. The bill currently faces deliberation in the House's Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Terri A. Sewell, D-AL, has introduced the Rosa Parks Day Act, aiming to establish Rosa Parks Day as an official federal holiday. This significant legislative initiative seeks to honor the legacy of the civil rights icon Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her bus seat catalyzed the civil rights movement.

The Rosa Parks Day Act emerges as a tribute not only to Parks’ profound impact on American society but also as a call to recognize and reflect on the ongoing struggles for racial and social justice. By designating Parks' birthday, February 4th, as a federal holiday, the bill encourages educational programs and activities that promote awareness of civil rights history and the fight against racial inequality.

The introduction of this bill comes at a time when many Americans are advocating for greater recognition of historical figures who advanced social justice causes. Proponents believe that establishing a federal holiday in honor of Parks would not only solidify her legacy but also inspire future generations to continue the fight for equality.

If passed, the Rosa Parks Day Act could have far-reaching implications, potentially serving as a catalyst for local and state governments to recognize the day through various observances and community events. Schools may also incorporate lessons on civil rights into their curricula, fostering a deeper understanding of the principles for which Parks stood.

This legislative effort aligns with recent movements across the country advocating for recognizing significant contributions to civil rights. The bill has received significant support from various co-sponsors, indicating a strong bipartisan consensus on the importance of honoring Rosa Parks and her enduring legacy in the ongoing struggle for equality and justice in America.

"$H billintroh-250205-hr999",40434,"Rep. Fletcher Introduces Right to Contraception Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-TX, has introduced the Right to Contraception Act, aiming to secure the right of individuals to access contraceptive methods and protect healthcare providers offering related services. The legislation comes in response to growing concerns about state-level restrictions on reproductive healthcare and the need for federal assurance of contraceptive access as a fundamental right.

The Right to Contraception Act aims to ensure that individuals can freely obtain and use contraceptives without facing coercion or discrimination. It is designed to counter recent legislative trends in several states that have sought to limit contraceptive options or impose stringent regulations on healthcare providers. By establishing a comprehensive legal framework, the bill would create statutory rights for individuals and healthcare providers involved in the provision and utilization of contraceptive services.

Historical context reveals an ongoing struggle for reproductive rights in the United States. The Supreme Court has recognized the constitutional right to contraception since the landmark case of Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965. However, recent rulings and state laws have raised alarms about the potential erosion of these rights. Rep. Fletcher’s legislation emphasizes the importance of access to contraception in promoting public health, preventing unintended pregnancies, and supporting women’s autonomy in health-related decision-making.

With significant backing, including over 200 co-sponsors, the bill underscores a collective commitment to safeguarding reproductive rights at the federal level. By framing the right to access contraceptives as an essential aspect of health equity, the Right to Contraception Act seeks not only to protect individual choices but also to address systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups in obtaining reproductive healthcare. As the bill progresses through Congress, it represents a critical step in affirming the right to contraception amidst a shifting legislative landscape.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-WA, has introduced the Flight 293 Remembrance Act to establish a comprehensive database of Armed Forces members who lost their lives in non-combat military plane crashes, while also providing crucial support to their bereaved families.

The legislation was prompted by a growing recognition of the unique sacrifices made by military personnel in non-combat situations. Current resources for the families of such service members are often inadequate or hard to access. The proposed bill aims to remedy this by documenting incidents of non-combat aviation losses and ensuring families receive the necessary support during their grieving process.

If passed, the Flight 293 Remembrance Act will require the Secretary of Defense to identify and maintain records of all non-combat military plane crashes since 1984, creating a publicly accessible database. This initiative will serve as a vital resource for historians and families alike, ensuring that these service members are not forgotten.

In addition to documentation, the legislation mandates the establishment of support programs tailored for the families of those who died in these incidents. This includes personalized guidance for accessing benefits, financial assistance, counseling services, and connections to community support networks. By addressing these critical needs, the bill aims to ease the burdens faced by families navigating the complexities of loss.

The Flight 293 Remembrance Act has been referred to both the Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs committees for further consideration. Strickland's proposal underscores the ongoing commitment to honor the sacrifices of all military personnel while ensuring that their families receive the recognition and support they deserve.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced legislation aimed at establishing the Fort Ontario Holocaust Refugee Shelter as a National Historical Park. This initiative seeks to honor the historic site where 982 Jewish refugees from World War II were sheltered from 1944 to 1946, preserving their stories for future generations.

The Fort Ontario National Monument, located in Oswego, New York, stands as a testament to both resilience and refuge during a critical period in American history. The proposed establishment of the park is rooted in a desire to provide a dedicated space for education and remembrance, ensuring that the contributions and experiences of Holocaust survivors are not forgotten. It reflects a growing movement in the U.S. towards acknowledging and memorializing places of historical significance related to the Holocaust.

The bill emphasizes the importance of preserving and interpreting the site to foster understanding among the public regarding its historical context. It mandates the Secretary of the Interior to determine the necessary land for the park's establishment and outlines cooperative agreements to enhance educational services and public access. The proposal also includes provisions for land acquisition, either through donation or other means, emphasizing the collaborative approach with local entities and stakeholders.

The establishment of the Fort Ontario National Historical Park is expected to have a profound impact on local tourism and education, reviving interest in historical narratives associated with wartime refugees. As the bill moves forward in Congress, advocates for Holocaust education are hopeful that this initiative will succeed in providing a permanent space for reflection and learning, reinforcing the values of tolerance and remembrance in contemporary society.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-OR, has introduced the Gambling Addiction Recovery, Investment, and Treatment Act, aiming to address the rising issue of gambling addiction in the United States. The bill authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use to award formula grants to states for combating gambling addiction and aims to enhance recovery efforts through financial support and research initiatives.

The impetus for this legislation arose from growing concerns about gambling-related issues, particularly in states where gaming has expanded rapidly. Recent studies indicate a significant increase in gambling addiction cases, prompting lawmakers to take proactive measures. This bill seeks to provide necessary resources for state programs, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and treatment for those affected by gambling disorders.

Under the proposed act, states will receive grants from the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, allocated based on current federal guidelines for substance abuse treatment funding. This ensures that funds are directed to local programs that can effectively tackle the pressing challenges associated with gambling addiction. Additionally, the bill empowers the National Institute on Drug Abuse to support relevant research aimed at understanding and mitigating the impact of gambling addiction.

The potential impact of this legislation is substantial, as it provides a framework for states to develop comprehensive programs tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore, by calling for a report to Congress within three years, the bill ensures accountability and evaluates the effectiveness of the implemented initiatives.

Overall, Rep. Salinas' legislation signals a critical step toward addressing gambling addiction and fostering healthier communities across the nation.

"$H billintroh-250211-hr1207",40434,"Rep. Mann Introduces Food for Peace Act Transfer Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Tracey Mann, R-KS, has introduced a new legislative proposal aimed at transferring the functions and responsibilities of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) regarding the Food for Peace Act to the Department of Agriculture. This move, presented on February 11, 2025, is designed to streamline the administration of food aid programs and enhance efficiency in managing U.S. food assistance abroad.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing calls for a more integrated approach to food security administration. By consolidating oversight under the Department of Agriculture, proponents argue that the initiative could foster better coordination of resources, decrease bureaucratic delays, and ultimately improve aid delivery to vulnerable populations around the world. The Food for Peace Act has played a crucial role in addressing global hunger, and advocates believe that this transition could strengthen its impact.

Critics, however, caution that transferring these responsibilities might introduce challenges. USAID has long been viewed as a leading agency in international development and aid distribution. There are concerns that the shift could dilute the agency's focus on humanitarian needs and disrupt ongoing aid programs that rely heavily on USAID’s unique expertise and global partnerships. Therefore, the bill will undergo thorough evaluation in the House Foreign Affairs and Agriculture Committees to address these potential hurdles.

The proposed bill reflects a broader trend of reform within U.S. foreign aid policy, emphasizing efficiency and accountability. If enacted, it could reshape how the United States approaches food assistance, reinforcing a commitment to addressing global hunger while adjusting the mechanisms through which it operates.

The bill (H.R. 1207) was introduced on [Introduction Date].

"$H billintroh-250211-hr1213",40434,"Rep. Schrier Introduces Forest Data Modernization Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Kim Schrier, D-WA, has introduced the Forest Data Modernization Act of 2025, a bill aimed at updating and enhancing the forest inventory and analysis program established under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978. This legislation seeks to improve data collection methods and ensure that forest carbon data is accurately reported.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to increasing concerns over climate change and the need for efficient management of forest resources. The legislation will modify existing protocols to include modern technologies such as remote sensing and machine learning, which could greatly enhance the precision of data on forest carbon stocks. This is particularly relevant as policymakers look for actionable insights to combat climate change and promote sustainable forestry practices.

If passed, the Forest Data Modernization Act could significantly impact forest management across the country. By ensuring streamlined data collection and improved reporting standards, the bill aims to provide federal and state agencies, as well as private stakeholders, with the necessary tools to monitor forest health and carbon output effectively. Moreover, the bill mandates that the data collected be made accessible to the public, promoting transparency and accountability.

This initiative aligns with growing movements to bolster environmental sustainability and forest conservation. With bipartisan support expected, it underscores the importance of comprehensive data in making informed policy decisions regarding the nation’s forest resources. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it highlights the urgent need for a modernized approach to understanding and managing America’s forests for future generations.

"$H billintroh-250211-hr1216",40434,"Rep. Tenney Introduces Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act, a bill aimed at eliminating federal funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). The proposed legislation seeks to reallocate funds that would have been directed to these entities, instead channeling them towards reducing the federal debt.

The motivation behind Tenney's bill stems from ongoing debates about the role of publicly funded media entities in the U.S. Critics of PBS and NPR argue that taxpayer-funded media disproportionately supports left-leaning narratives and undermines the principles of free-market journalism. The act aims to address these concerns by prohibiting any federal money from being allocated to these organizations, along with any successors. 

If passed, the bill would prevent PBS and NPR from receiving funds directly or indirectly through agreements or dues paid by public broadcasting stations. Furthermore, it emphasizes a swift transition of financial resources toward reducing the public debt over the fiscal years 2025-2027, thereby enhancing the government's focus on fiscal responsibility.

Historically, federal funding for public broadcasting has remained a contentious issue, with arguments rooted in budgetary constraints and philosophical beliefs about government roles in media. Tenney's proposal is likely to rekindle debates within Congress regarding the value of public broadcasting, particularly as financial pressures on the federal budget continue to escalate.

As the bill progresses, it will be reviewed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where its implications for the future of public broadcasting will be critically assessed. The outcome could significantly reshape the funding landscape for media organizations traditionally supported by federal dollars.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1288",40434,"Rep. Brownley Introduces DRIVE Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Julia Brownley, D-CA, has introduced the DRIVE Act of 2025, designed to increase the mileage reimbursement rate for veterans participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs' Beneficiary Travel program. The bill aims to alleviate financial burdens on veterans who travel for medical care.

This legislation responds to rising transportation costs, which significantly impact veterans' access to healthcare. Currently, the mileage reimbursement rate of 41.5 cents per mile has not kept pace with the increasing expenses associated with vehicle operation. By aligning the reimbursement rate with that of government employees when private vehicles are used for official business, the bill seeks to enhance equity among veteran beneficiaries.

The DRIVE Act also addresses the timely processing of reimbursements, mandating that allowances must be paid within 90 days of a properly submitted request. This provision aims to reduce the financial strain on veterans awaiting reimbursements for travel expenses.

With nearly 20 million veterans in the United States, many rely on these travel reimbursements to access necessary healthcare services, particularly those living in rural areas who may travel considerable distances for appointments. By improving reimbursement rates and processing times, the DRIVE Act of 2025 stands to provide significant support and relief to those who have served the nation.

This bill represents a collaborative effort among various lawmakers, receiving sponsorship from a diverse group of representatives, including bipartisan support. As it proceeds to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, advocates hope for swift action to enhance provisions for the veteran community, ensuring they receive the critical care they deserve without being hindered by financial barriers.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1303",40434,"Rep. Fischbach Introduces Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-MN, has introduced the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act, aimed at stopping the enforcement of new staffing regulations for long-term care facilities in the United States. The legislation seeks to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from implementing minimum staffing standards and transparency reporting requirements established in a recent rule by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The bill was prompted by significant concerns from caregivers and operators of long-term care facilities, who argue that the new mandates could exacerbate staffing shortages and negatively affect patient care. Stakeholders claim that enforcing minimum staffing levels could hinder operational flexibility, threatening the viability of many facilities, particularly in rural areas.

If passed, the bill would prevent the federal government from applying the finalized rules published in May 2024, which mandated certain staffing ratios intended to enhance the quality of care in nursing homes. Proponents of the legislation claim that rather than imposing rigid standards, a more nuanced approach is necessary, allowing facilities to determine the best care models for their residents based on individual needs.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing tensions between federal policy and state regulations regarding elder care. Advocates for senior citizens express mixed sentiments about the bill; while some believe it could maintain necessary operational flexibility, others fear it undermines essential protections for vulnerable residents.

The Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act has been referred to the House Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce for further consideration. As the debate around long-term care reforms continues, stakeholders are keenly watching the progress of this legislation.

"$H billintroh-250213-hr1317",40434,"Rep. Joyce Introduces I CAN Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. David Joyce, R-OH, introduced the Improving Care and Access to Nurses Act (I CAN Act) on February 13, 2025, aiming to enhance healthcare access by expanding the roles of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) within the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The legislation seeks to remove existing barriers that currently limit the capability of these healthcare professionals in providing essential medical services.

The I CAN Act comes in response to the growing need for increased healthcare access, especially following the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the strain on the healthcare system and the critical need for efficient care delivery. By allowing APRNs greater autonomy, the bill aims to address the physician shortage and improve patient outcomes by enabling a broader scope of practice.

Key provisions of the bill include allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to fulfill coverage documentation requirements under Medicare for diabetes-related footwear and facilitating their involvement in setting up cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Moreover, the Act aims to enhance care delivery in skilled nursing facilities, enabling patients to receive comprehensive care from nurse practitioners.

The potential impact of the I CAN Act is significant, as it is expected to improve healthcare access for millions of Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid. By streamlining procedures and eliminating unnecessary supervisory requirements for APRNs, the legislation anticipates a reduction in patient wait times and an overall enhancement in care quality.

As the bill moves forward to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means for review, advocates highlight its importance in reshaping the healthcare landscape to better accommodate the evolving demands for service delivery, especially in underserved areas.

"$H billintroh-250218-hr1426",40434,"Rep. Mackenzie Introduces Child Care Credit Enhancement Bill","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-PA, has introduced a significant piece of legislation aimed at reforming the Internal Revenue Code to substantially increase tax credits associated with household and dependent care services, as well as the employer-provided child care credit. This landmark proposal seeks to raise the maximum available credit under these provisions, which could provide considerable financial relief to families and encourage employer support for child care services.

The initiative stems from the growing challenges faced by working families in accessing affordable child care, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many families find it increasingly difficult to balance work obligations with the necessity of quality child care. By amplifying the tax benefits provided for both dependent care and employer contributions towards child care, the bill aims to ease some of this burden, making child care more accessible for American families.

Pending approval, the legislation proposes lifting the household and dependent care service credit from $3,000 to $6,000 for one qualifying individual, and from $6,000 to $12,000 for two or more individuals. Furthermore, the employer-provided child care credit limit is set to rise from $150,000 to $400,000, offering a robust incentive for companies to invest in child care solutions for their employees.

Supporters of the bill argue that such enhancements are critical for fostering a healthier work-life balance and supporting economic growth, as they would allow more parents to participate actively in the workforce. With family-oriented initiatives gaining traction, this legislative move presents an opportunity for transformed child care policy in the United States. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 1426) was introduced on 02/18/2025.

"$H billintroh-250225-hr1559",40434,"Rep. Connolly Introduces Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-VA, has introduced the Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act of 2025 aimed at enhancing the rights of certain postal service employees to appeal decisions made against them. This legislation extends the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board for eligible employees within the United States Postal Service (USPS), particularly those who are not represented by a bargaining unit.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to longstanding concerns regarding the protections afforded to USPS employees in managerial and supervisory roles, many of whom found themselves without effective recourse against adverse actions. By expanding appeal rights, the bill seeks to bring the USPS in line with typical federal employee protections, fostering a fairer workplace environment.

The potential impact of the Postal Employee Appeal Rights Amendment Act is significant. Advocates argue it could help create a more equitable system where employees can contest unfair treatment, thereby improving their job security and morale. This is particularly crucial as USPS continues to adapt to evolving operational challenges and various financial pressures. By ensuring employees' rights to appeal decisions, the legislation demonstrates a commitment to accountability and transparency within the organization.

Historically, postal workers in supervisory and administrative positions have been at a disadvantage regarding workplace grievances due to their lack of representation. The bill proposes not only to redefine their rights but also to emphasize the importance of a supportive work culture at USPS, aiming to mitigate issues of arbitrary decision-making that can undermine employee confidence and service delivery.

As the bill advances through the legislative process, stakeholders from both labor and management will closely monitor its progression, ultimately hoping for an outcome that better protects postal employees' rights.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-CT, has introduced a new bill aimed at enhancing the safety of firearm storage in households across the United States. Dubbed Ethan's Law, the legislation seeks to require secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors and individuals ineligible to possess firearms, thus attempting to reduce the risk of unintentional shootings and youth suicides.

Ethan's Law comes as a response to alarming statistics indicating that millions of minors reside in households with unsecured firearms. Many children are reportedly aware of their parents' firearm locations, with a significant number having handled those firearms. The bill is designed to address these risks by mandating that firearm owners secure their weapons in a manner that prevents access by unauthorized individuals. 

If enacted, the law will categorize offenders who fail to secure their firearms as violating a federal statute, subjecting them to fines and potential imprisonment if a minor accesses the weapon and causes harm. Furthermore, it establishes a Firearm Safe Storage Program, which would provide state and tribal governments with grants to promote compliance with safe storage practices. 

The introduction of this bill highlights a growing recognition of the role of secure firearm storage in preventing gun violence and accidents, especially among youth. Advocacy groups and lawmakers hope that Ethan's Law will spur more comprehensive reforms in gun legislation to address the ongoing epidemic of firearm-related injuries and fatalities. As discussions around gun control continue, Ethan’s Law represents a proactive approach toward ensuring that firearm safety is prioritized in homes across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Warren Davidson, R-OH, has introduced the Financial Privacy Act of 2025, aimed at enhancing transparency and safeguarding consumer data under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The legislation seeks to address concerns over the vast collection of personal financial information held by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), ensuring greater protection of individual privacy.

The bill responds to mounting criticism about the sheer volume of reports generated under the BSA, which has led to over 322 million Currency Transaction Reports and 36 million Suspicious Activity Reports since its inception. Advocates argue that while some data is essential for combating financial crime, much of it lacks significant law enforcement relevance and poses risks to Americans' privacy. By requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to submit annual reports to Congress detailing the data collected, the bill aims to hold financial institutions accountable and evaluate the necessity of such extensive information gathering.

Proponents of the Financial Privacy Act believe it can help restore public trust in financial systems by providing clearer guidelines on data handling, retention, and authorized access. The proposed legislative changes mandate a review and possible revision of the protocols governing agency access to BSA reports. This step is critical to balancing the needs of national security and law enforcement with the civil liberties and privacy rights of American citizens.

As the bill progresses, its outcome may redefine how financial data is managed, offering more significant protections for individuals while still addressing the nation's security needs. Moving forward, the House Financial Services Committee is expected to review the legislation, with the potential for broader implications on privacy rights in financial matters.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Student Loan Relief Act, aimed at alleviating the financial burden faced by millions of recent college graduates. The legislation proposes a temporary pause on student loan repayments and interest accumulation, providing relief during a time when young professionals are struggling to establish themselves in an uncertain job market.

The Student Loan Relief Act was introduced in response to growing concerns about the long-term economic implications of student debt on new graduates. With the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing challenges in job placement and wage growth, many graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to manage their loan repayments. This bill seeks to support them by offering a reprieve that can assist with their transition into the workforce.

The legislation is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of borrowers in the United States. By pausing loan repayments and interest, the bill aims to free up financial resources for young adults to invest in their careers, housing, and other essential expenses. This relief could potentially reduce the number of defaults and delinquencies on student loans, ultimately benefiting the economy by allowing graduates to contribute as consumers.

Furthermore, the Student Loan Relief Act aligns with a growing legislative trend toward addressing the student debt crisis. Previous measures have been put into place, such as temporary pauses during the pandemic, but advocates argue that a more permanent solution is necessary. By introducing this bill, Rep. Smith hopes to create sustainable pathways for graduates to gain financial stability without the looming burden of student loan debt.

As the bill moves through Congress, its proponents will advocate for swift passage, emphasizing its importance in fostering economic growth and ensuring that education remains accessible to future generations.

"$H billintroh-250311-hr2087",40434,"Rep. Tonko Introduces SAFE Bet Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY, has introduced the SAFE Bet Act of 2025 aimed at establishing rigorous federal standards for sports betting across the United States. The legislation seeks to ensure the integrity of wagering practices and protect public health amid the rising popularity of sports betting following its legalization in many states.

The SAFE Bet Act comes in response to concerns regarding the lack of cohesive regulation in the expanding sports betting landscape. Currently, regulations vary dramatically from state to state, which can lead to confusion for bettors and loopholes that might be exploited. By setting a federal framework, the act aims to standardize practices related to sports wagering, promoting fair play and accountability among operators.

Key provisions of the SAFE Bet Act include the establishment of a national self-exclusion list, allowing individuals to voluntarily restrict their participation in sports betting if they experience gambling-related issues. Additionally, the act mandates annual surveys on the public health impacts of sports betting, highlighting the potential rise of gambling disorders in the population.

The legislation also includes consumer protection measures such as limiting the types of bets that can be accepted and requiring operators to verify the identity and age of their customers, ensuring that individuals under 21 are not allowed to wager. Furthermore, it prohibits the use of credit cards for deposits, addressing concerns regarding financial responsibility.

The introduction of the SAFE Bet Act is seen as a significant step towards enhancing the safety and integrity of sports betting while balancing the interests of states and the federal government in regulating this emerging industry. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources for further consideration.

The bill (H.R. 2087) was introduced on 03/11/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Sean Casten, D-IL, has introduced the Preventing Illegal Weapons Trafficking Act of 2025, aimed at curbing the importation and proliferation of machinegun conversion devices in the United States. The bill seeks to enhance federal strategies for intercepting these devices, which can convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic weapons, thereby increasing gun violence.

This legislation responds to escalating concerns around gun violence and illegal trafficking. In recent years, there has been a notable rise in crimes involving machinegun conversion devices, prompting lawmakers to take action. The bill mandates a comprehensive strategy from key federal agencies, including the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security, to combat the illegal import and trafficking of these dangerous devices. 

Under the proposed framework, federal agencies will be required to improve their detection and interception capabilities, particularly at ports of entry. The legislation also emphasizes collaboration between federal, state, and local law enforcement to trace and recover machinegun conversion devices used in crimes. Crucially, the bill addresses the modern technology used in their production, such as 3D printing, which poses new challenges to law enforcement efforts.

Further, the bill stipulates that the Attorney General will include findings related to machinegun conversion devices in annual firearms trafficking reports, heightening transparency and accountability. The introduction of this bill is seen as a significant step towards enhancing public safety and addressing the complex issues related to firearm trafficking.

Rep. Casten's legislation has garnered support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, underscoring a collective commitment to tackling the urgent issue of gun violence in America. As the bill moves to committee review, its advocates are optimistic about its potential impact on reducing illegal weapons trafficking.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2106",40434,"Rep. Costa Introduces Expanding Medical Education Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jim Costa, D-CA, has introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act aimed at boosting medical education opportunities in underserved areas across the nation. This legislation seeks to establish a grant program to support schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine, primarily focusing on regions identified as medically underserved or struggling with a shortage of health professionals.

The need for this bill arises from increasing concerns about the lack of healthcare access in numerous communities across the United States. Many areas are facing significant challenges due to a shortage of medical professionals, particularly in rural locations. By funding the establishment and expansion of medical schools in these areas, the bill aims to create a new generation of healthcare providers who can deliver care where it's most needed.

Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to award grants to institutions for developing medical education programs. Priority would be given to projects that establish schools in areas that currently lack them, especially those that serve populations from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. Such measures are designed to enhance diversity within the medical field, making healthcare providers more reflective of the communities they serve.

The Expanding Medical Education Act also outlines specific uses for the awarded funds, including recruitment and retention of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and curriculum development centered on serving rural and underserved populations. Additionally, institutions would be encouraged to modernize facilities and support educational programs aimed at increasing healthcare accessibility.

If passed, this act has the potential to transform the landscape of medical education in the U.S., ensuring that future physicians are better equipped to address the healthcare needs of all communities.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX, has introduced the Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education (GME) Support Reauthorization Act. This legislation aims to extend funding through 2030 for children’s hospitals that provide graduate medical education programs, ensuring the continued training of pediatric healthcare professionals.

The bill comes at a critical time as pediatric hospital systems face increasing pressures to train qualified medical professionals. With the shortage of pediatricians being a growing concern across the United States, this reauthorization is intended to bolster the workforce that specializes in child healthcare. The proposed act will provide $124 million annually for hospitals and $261 million for educational programs connected to these institutions.

In addition to its funding provisions, the bill introduces measures to prohibit payments to hospitals that administer specific medical procedures and drugs to minors, particularly those related to gender transition treatments. This stipulation underscores ongoing debates around children's medical care and the rights of parents and guardians in making healthcare decisions.

The reauthorization aims to address important health policy issues including the financial stability of children’s hospitals and the ethical considerations surrounding pediatric treatments. By securing these funds, the act seeks to improve access to specialized medical education while promoting responsible care standards for vulnerable minors.

Federal investment in children's medical education and care has historically received bipartisan support, reflecting a shared commitment to safeguarding and improving the health of the nation’s youth. As the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reviews the bill, advocates of children's health anticipate positive outcomes from this legislative effort.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-IL, has introduced the TANF State Expenditure Integrity Act as a measure to enhance oversight of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The proposed legislation aims to address intentional misuse of TANF funds by establishing more stringent monitoring processes for the use of funds by subrecipients.

This bill comes in response to ongoing concerns about the improper allocation of TANF resources. Reports of fund mismanagement have spurred bipartisan interest in reforming how states are held accountable for their financial stewardship. By creating a TANF Program Integrity Unit at the Administration for Children & Families, the legislation seeks to supplement existing audits, allowing for more thorough tracking and scrutiny of fund usage at the state level.

The impact of this bill could be significant, as it would impose tighter regulations and potentially lead to improved cash assistance provisions for families in need. Any identified misuse of funds would necessitate states to reimburse the misallocated amounts by directing equal funds toward cash assistance for low-income families. This corrective approach is designed not only to deter fraud but also to ensure that assistance effectively reaches those who need it most.

The proposed changes would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to introduce new monitoring frameworks and ensure that they are operational within two years of enactment. By enhancing the fiscal integrity of the TANF program, Rep. Davis hopes to safeguard public funds and strengthen the support network for vulnerable families in Illinois and across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, R-PA, has introduced the ROCR Value Based Program Act, designed to reform Medicare payment structures for radiation oncology services. The proposed legislation seeks to implement a new case rate value-based payment program that aims to improve patient access to radiation therapy while ensuring the quality and affordability of care.

The ROCR Act is motivated by a growing need for a more efficient Medicare payment system, especially as approximately 60% of cancer patients receive radiation therapy. Historical challenges in accurately pricing radiation oncology services have led to payment inconsistencies, often resulting in reduced access to care. By creating a stable payment structure that prioritizes patient-centered care, this bill aims to reduce disparities in service provision and promote high-value care.

The legislation proposes creating per-episode payments to radiation therapy providers, which will incentivize efficient treatment plans while containing overall costs. Additionally, it includes provisions to facilitate free or discounted transportation services for patients, particularly those from underserved demographics, ensuring they can access necessary treatment without financial barriers.

Fitzpatrick's initiative is part of a broader effort to revamp healthcare payment systems in the United States, reflecting an acknowledgment of the complexities in delivering specialized medical services. By establishing a value-based approach, the bill anticipates better outcomes for cancer patients and aims for significant Medicare savings.

As the bill progresses through committees, it is expected to receive scrutiny regarding its potential impact on healthcare providers and patient access across the nation. With support from colleagues across party lines, including Reps. Jimmy Panetta, John Joyce, and Paul Tonko, the ROCR Value Based Program Act represents a pivotal step toward reforming how radiation oncology is financed under Medicare.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-NY, has introduced the NFIP Extension Act of 2025 aimed at reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). This legislative initiative seeks to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 by extending program financing and expiration dates to September 30, 2025.

The NFIP is crucial for millions of Americans living in flood-prone areas, as it provides the necessary insurance coverage to safeguard homes and businesses from flood-related damages. Rep. Garbarino's introduction of the bill comes in response to ongoing concerns about the program's viability, particularly as previous authorization deadlines have approached. By ensuring continued access to affordable flood insurance, the bill aims to protect homeowners and promote stability in vulnerable communities.

Historically, the NFIP has faced challenges related to funding and sustainability. The need for its reauthorization reflects the ongoing risks associated with climate change and increasing severe weather events, which have made flood events more frequent and damaging. Proponents of the program argue that a robust insurance mechanism is essential not only for individual protection but also for overall community resilience.

Passing this bill would significantly impact homeowners relying on flood insurance, allowing them to maintain coverage without interruption. Additionally, it would provide peace of mind to lenders and real estate markets in flood-affected regions, who depend on the NFIP for secure transactions.

As Congress considers this legislation, all eyes will be on the Financial Services Committee, where the bill has been referred for further discussion. The success of this extension is vital, as it ensures that the NFIP continues to meet the pressing needs of American communities facing flood risks.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brandon Gill, R-TX, has introduced the LAND Act, legislation aimed at restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land within the United States. The bill mandates that foreign buyers must adhere to the same purchasing constraints imposed on U.S. citizens in their respective countries. This legislation emerges from growing concerns about national security and agriculture land controlled by foreign entities.

The LAND Act seeks to establish a level playing field for both domestic and foreign purchasers, stipulating that any foreign national or corporation looking to buy agricultural land in the U.S. must face equivalent regulations as they would encounter in their home country. This move addresses fears that certain foreign interests may acquire agricultural land, particularly near sensitive areas such as military installations.

The bill proposes the creation of a U.S. Land Protection Task Force, tasked with ensuring compliance and monitoring land transactions involving foreign parties. It will require sellers to report foreign sales to the Secretary of Agriculture, thereby increasing transparency and oversight.

In light of the increasing scrutiny over foreign investments in critical sectors, the LAND Act represents a proactive approach to safeguarding U.S. agricultural resources. The bill also reflects bipartisan support, having garnered backing from several co-sponsors, reinforcing its significance in legislative discussions surrounding national security and agricultural integrity.

As the bill progresses through the House Agriculture Committee, its implications could reshape foreign investment strategies, influencing how agricultural land is bought, sold, and managed in the United States. The LAND Act embodies a broader legislative trend aimed at protecting American interests amidst evolving global dynamics.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-IA, has introduced the Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act of 2025 to impose strict sanctions against Chinese police organizations operating within the United States. The proposal aims to counter growing concerns about foreign law enforcement agencies establishing a presence on U.S. soil, thereby threatening the civil liberties and safety of American citizens.

The bill was prompted by increasing reports of Chinese police stations functioning clandestinely in several U.S. cities. These operations reportedly seek to monitor and intimidate Chinese nationals and other communities, raising alarm among lawmakers about potential violations of U.S. sovereignty and human rights. By introducing this legislation, Hinson seeks to safeguard American citizens from foreign interference and unlawful surveillance.

The Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act would empower the President to sanction Chinese police departments and their affiliates, thereby blocking any transactions involving their assets within U.S. borders. Additionally, the act aims to render individuals associated with these departments inadmissible to the U.S., thus tightening immigration policies against foreign law enforcement figures attempting to operate domestically.

This action aligns with increasing bipartisan efforts to confront China's growing influence and its tactics that violate international norms. It reflects a broader U.S. strategy to deter foreign interference in domestic affairs while reinforcing the rule of law. The bill has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee for further consideration. 

As concerns over foreign police presence escalate, the outcome of this bill may set a precedent for how the U.S. government handles international law enforcement operations on its territory. The proposed sanctions underscore a significant shift in American policy aimed at protecting the integrity and safety of its populace.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Susie Lee, D-NV, has introduced the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act to promote conservation and economic growth in Clark County, Nevada. This comprehensive bill encompasses land transfers intended to empower local tribes, enhance public safety, and expand recreational opportunities within southern Nevada.

The legislation arises from a pressing need to balance economic development with environmental preservation amid rapid growth in the region. With Las Vegas and neighboring areas experiencing significant population increases, local officials and tribal leaders have pushed for measures that ensure sustainable development while protecting natural resources. Key components of the bill include the transfer of over 44,000 acres of federal land to the Moapa Band of Paiutes and the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, providing these communities with greater autonomy and access to resources.

In addition to supporting tribal empowerment, the act delineates adjustments to conservation area boundaries and designates new wilderness areas, ultimately expanding protections for diverse ecosystems and cultural sites. This not only fosters biodiversity but can also enhance tourism, which is vital for the local economy.

The impact of this bill could be substantial, as it lays the groundwork for broader land management strategies, enabling local governments to initiate projects aimed at flood control, public safety training, and access to vital water supplies. For instance, specific clauses allow for land conveyances to build fire training facilities and other public purpose structures, which are crucial for effective emergency responses in a rapidly growing area.

By fostering cooperation between federal agencies, state authorities, and tribal nations, the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act reflects a holistic approach to governance, aiming to secure both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship for future generations.

"$H billintroh-250314-hr2153",40434,"Rep. Nunn Introduces Fight for Families Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Zachary Nunn, R-IA, has introduced the Fight for Families Act aimed at modifying the adoption tax credit to support families adopting special needs children. This legislation seeks to enhance the financial support available to families who pursue these crucial adoptions by making the credit refundable.

The rationale behind introducing this bill stems from the need to alleviate the financial burden often faced by families adopting children with special needs. The current non-refundable nature of the credit can restrict access for lower-income families, who may not have sufficient tax liability to benefit from it. By making the credit refundable, families will receive funds regardless of their tax situation, which could encourage more adoptions.

The Fight for Families Act proposes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code to treat the adoption credit for special needs children as a refundable tax credit. Eligible expenses that qualify under this initiative include a range of costs associated with the adoption process, thus making it easier for families to meet these expenses without significant financial strain. 

Supporters of the bill argue it is a necessary step toward improving the lives of children with special needs and the families who adopt them. With an increasing number of children in need of loving homes, lawmakers anticipate that the financial adjustments enforced by the legislation could lead to a rise in special needs adoptions.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, where it will likely undergo evaluations and discussions addressing its implications for broader adoption policies in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Frederica S. Wilson, D-FL, has introduced the Transportation Equity Act, aimed at re-establishing an advisory committee to provide independent guidance on transportation-related issues from a variety of stakeholders. The bill, presented on March 14, 2025, seeks to enhance transportation equity by integrating diverse perspectives in planning and policy development.

The initiative to revive this committee addresses growing concerns about equitable transportation access across communities, particularly underserved and marginalized populations. By gathering input from academia, community groups, and various levels of government, the committee will help to inform and shape policies that could significantly impact economic development and connectivity. This move is perceived as a critical step towards ensuring all communities receive fair treatment in transportation planning.

Currently, transportation systems often reflect systemic inequities, which can hinder social and economic mobility for certain demographics. This legislation aims to address these disparities by focusing on comprehensive strategies that promote equitable transportation access. It emphasizes the need for a strategic plan that includes national metrics on transportation effectiveness relative to socio-economic factors.

If passed, the Transportation Equity Act will result in the formation of a committee composed of 9 to 15 members, reflecting a broad range of experiences and viewpoints from across the nation. Members will serve two-year terms and are expected to meet at least twice a year to evaluate the Department of Transportation's efforts in fostering community connectivity and opportunity.

As the nation grapples with various transport-related challenges, including climate change and urban congestion, this bill represents a proactive approach toward building a more inclusive and effective transportation framework that benefits all citizens.

Eric Burlison, R-MO, introduced the Paycheck Protection Act on March 18, 2025, aimed at prohibiting federal agencies from deducting labor organization dues from employees' paychecks. This legislation seeks to address concerns regarding the financial impact of mandatory deductions, empowering employees by enhancing their control over their earnings.

The introduction of the Paycheck Protection Act is rooted in ongoing debates about labor unions and employee rights. Proponents argue that mandatory dues deductions can limit individual choice, leading federal employees to support organizations they may not fully endorse. By eliminating these deductions, the act intends to foster a more empowered workforce, allowing employees to determine how their finances are allocated.

Should this bill pass, it could significantly affect the operations and funding of labor organizations. Without a direct source of funding from employees' wages, unions may experience reduced financial support, compelling them to explore alternative methods of recruitment and fundraising. Detractors of the bill argue that it undermines collective bargaining power, potentially weakening labor representation in federal workplaces.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for further consideration. As discussions evolve, various stakeholders, including labor unions, employee advocacy groups, and government officials, will likely weigh in on its implications for federal employment and labor relations.

The Paycheck Protection Act represents a pivotal moment in the relationship between employees and labor organizations, following movements in several states toward similar legislation. If enacted, this bill may set a precedent that could influence labor policy on a national level, potentially reshaping the landscape of employee rights and union funding across the country.

The bill (H.R. 2174) introduced on 03/18/2025 has 2 co-sponsors: Rep. Miller, Mary E. [R-IL-15]...03/18/2025; Rep. Mace, Nancy [R-SC-1]...03/18/2025.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2185",40434,"Rep. Espaillat Introduces Mink VIRUS Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, has introduced the Mink VIRUS Act, aimed at safeguarding public health by banning the farming of mink for fur and providing financial assistance to farmers transitioning away from the industry. This legislative effort responds to growing concerns over the zoonotic transmission of viruses from mink, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bill proposes a prohibition on mink farming, effective one year after its enactment, and mandates that any termination of farmed mink must adhere to humane euthanasia practices in line with veterinary guidelines. Violations of these requirements could result in substantial penalties, emphasizing the government’s commitment to animal welfare and public health safety. 

The Mink VIRUS Act also establishes a compensation program designed to aid affected fur farm owners. This program aims to cover costs associated with the compliance of the new regulations and the market value of their mink operations, thereby softening the financial blow of transitioning out of the mink farming business. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to implement this program within 180 days, ensuring timely assistance for farmers.

This legislation underscores the federal government's recognition of the risks posed by fur farming, particularly its potential role in the spread of infectious diseases. By eliminating the commercial farming of mink, the Mink VIRUS Act seeks to mitigate biosecurity threats while also addressing ethical concerns related to animal welfare. As the measure moves forward in Congress, it could reshape the fur industry landscape in the United States and strengthen health protocols in agricultural practices.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Ron Estes, R-KS, has introduced a bill aimed at amending the Internal Revenue Code to restore limitations on downward attribution of stock ownership in applying constructive ownership rules. The proposed legislation seeks to clarify and tighten the rules governing how U.S. persons are considered owners of stock owned by non-U.S. counterparts, an adjustment to ensure compliance and fairness in tax regulations.

The bill was prompted by concerns that existing attribution rules create loopholes that could allow foreign entities to influence American companies without appropriate taxation or oversight. By narrowing the loopholes, Estey aims to enhance the integrity of the U.S. tax system and promote fair competition for domestic businesses.

With this proposed amendment, the legislation intends to prevent U.S. taxpayers from being labeled as stock owners based solely on holdings by foreign entities. This measure is expected to have widespread implications on how businesses structure their operations to comply with U.S. tax laws, and could ultimately lead to a more equitable landscape for American companies competing against foreign firms.

Furthermore, Rep. Estes emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the U.S. tax system does not inadvertently encourage foreign investment schemes that bypass compliance with U.S. taxation rules. The proposed restoration of these limitations reflects a commitment to maintaining a fair and robust economic environment.

As the bill moves forward, it is set to be evaluated by the House Committee on Ways and Means. Stakeholders from various sectors are expected to weigh in on the potential impacts of these changes, which could reshape how ownership structures are perceived for tax purposes in the upcoming years.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2190",40434,"Rep. Foster Introduces Shareholder Political Transparency Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bill Foster, D-IL, has introduced the Shareholder Political Transparency Act aimed at increasing accountability in corporate political spending. This bill, presented on March 18, 2025, proposes amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requiring companies to report their political expenditures in a transparent manner.

The motivation behind the legislation arises from growing concerns regarding corporations' political influence, which often occurs without shareholder consent or knowledge. Foster and other proponents argue that shareholders deserve full visibility of how their investments are utilized in political activities. The bill aims to empower shareholders by mandating that companies disclose any political contributions or expenditures exceeding $10,000, detailing the recipient candidates and causes, and providing a breakdown of spending on political activities quarterly.

The potential impact of this bill is significant, as it could reshape how corporations engage in political advocacy and donor transparency, fostering a more informed shareholder base. The measure addresses a critical gap in current regulations, emphasizing the need for corporations to align their political engagements with the interests of their stakeholders. The new reporting requirements would not just provide transparency but could also deter corporations from making politically motivated expenditures that do not reflect shareholder interests.

By enhancing the transparency of corporate political spending, the Shareholder Political Transparency Act could play a transformative role in American governance, promoting more equitable access to political influence and reducing undue corporate sway in the electoral process. As the bill moves forward in Congress, it remains to be seen how it will be received and what adjustments might be proposed by various stakeholders.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2214",40434,"Rep. Miller-Meeks Introduces DRUG Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-IA, has introduced the Delinking Revenue from Unfair Gouging Act (DRUG Act) aimed at reforming practices by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The bill seeks to prohibit these entities from receiving any form of remuneration from health plans for services associated with prescription drug benefits, starting from January 1, 2027.

This legislation responds to growing concerns about transparency and unfair pricing practices in the pharmaceutical sector. PBMs have often been criticized for their lack of accountability and the significant profits they generate, which many argue leads to inflated drug prices. The DRUG Act's primary goal is to ensure that costs for consumers are lowered by eliminating financial incentives that may encourage price hikes and fees that do not directly benefit patients. 

If enacted, the bill will only allow PBMs to charge flat service fees defined by specific agreements, thus removing any contingent payments based on drug prices or discounts. Supporters of the bill believe this would ultimately enhance the affordability of medication for millions of Americans while holding PBMs more accountable for their practices.

The potential impact of the DRUG Act is significant, as it addresses systemic issues within the healthcare system that contribute to overall rising drug costs. By making these changes, it could result in reduced out-of-pocket costs for patients and foster competitive practices among PBMs. The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Workforce for further consideration. 

The introduction of the DRUG Act marks a critical step toward improving the landscape of prescription drug benefits in the United States, aiming to protect consumers from unjust pricing and ensure that healthcare remains accessible for all.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Troy Nehls, R-TX, has introduced the Stop California from Advancing Regulatory Burden Act of 2025, a bill aimed at amending the Clean Air Act by eliminating a waiver that allows certain states to adopt stricter motor vehicle emissions standards based on California regulations. The bill seeks to prevent states from implementing emissions standards that exceed federal requirements.

The introduction of this bill reflects ongoing concerns among some lawmakers regarding the potential economic impact of stringent environmental regulations set by California, which are sometimes viewed as excessive by other regions. Rep. Nehls and several co-sponsors argue that these regulations could burden manufacturers and automobile dealers, leading to increased costs for consumers and reduced job opportunities within the automotive sector.

If passed, the Stop CARB Act would revoke the authority of states to independently set emissions standards, effectively standardizing policies across the country. This approach is anticipated to ease compliance burdens for vehicle manufacturers and promote a uniform regulatory environment. Alongside this, the legislation aims to dismantle existing waivers granted to states that had previously opted to follow California's more rigorous standards.

Environmental advocates have criticized such measures, arguing that relaxing emissions standards could hinder progress toward reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. They caution that rollback of these regulations might adversely affect air quality and public health. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for review, stakeholders from various sectors—including automotive, environmental, and public health—are expected to voice their perspectives on the proposed legislation. The outcome of this bill could have lasting implications for environmental regulation and automotive industry practices in the United States.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, has introduced the Salary History Question Prohibition Act, aimed at reforming how employers handle wage history inquiries during the hiring process. The legislation seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit employers from relying on prospective employees' previous salary information when making hiring decisions or setting wages.

The introduction of this bill reflects a growing concern about wage discrimination and the impact of past salary on future earnings. Many advocates argue that basing wages on previous salaries can perpetuate existing pay gaps, especially for women and minorities. By disallowing salary history questions, the legislation aims to level the playing field for all job applicants, potentially leading to fairer and more equitable hiring practices in industries across the country.

If passed, the Salary History Question Prohibition Act will make it unlawful for employers to demand wage history from prospective employees or former employers, unless the candidate voluntarily provides it after receiving an initial job offer. Infringements will lead to penalties, including civil fines and possible compensatory damages for affected individuals. The proposed bill emphasizes the need for transparency in wage negotiations and encourages dialogue about compensation based on market value rather than historical earnings.

This legislative move is part of a broader trend as various states have already adopted similar laws, reflecting an evolving attitude towards employment practices. Norton’s initiative, now referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, could mark a significant shift in workforce policies if it gains the necessary support for passage.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Emily Randall, D-WA, recently introduced the Office of Management and Budget Inspector General Act to establish an independent Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This bill aims to enhance oversight by appointing an Inspector General responsible for auditing and investigating OMB operations, ensuring accountability and transparency in federal budgeting processes.

The bill was introduced in response to growing concerns over the effectiveness and integrity of budget management and oversight in federal agencies. With the OMB handling a substantial portion of the federal budget, lawmakers believe an independent oversight office is crucial in preventing waste, fraud, and abuse. By creating an OIG for the OMB, proponents argue that it will bolster public trust in government operations and improve overall financial accountability.

If enacted, the Inspector General would be appointed by the President and would serve to monitor specific matters assigned to the OMB by law. This initiative is seen as a necessary step to boost robustness in federal operations, particularly in light of recent audits that have raised questions regarding how taxpayer dollars are managed. The bill has garnered bipartisan support, underscoring a shared commitment to improve federal financial management and oversight.

Historically, the OMB has faced criticism for lacking sufficient internal oversight mechanisms. The establishment of an OIG is part of a broader trend among federal agencies to strengthen accountability measures. Lawmakers can be expected to debate the bill in the coming weeks, as discussions around fiscal responsibility and government transparency remain pivotal issues for many constituents across the political spectrum.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-OR, has introduced the Building Capacity for Care Act, aimed at expanding mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities across the nation. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide loans, grants, and loan guarantees aimed at enhancing pediatric and adult treatment facilities.

The legislative initiative comes in response to the escalating mental health crisis and substance use issues affecting communities nationwide. With increasing rates of mental health disorders and substance use, expanding access to care is more crucial than ever. The Building Capacity for Care Act aims to improve treatment infrastructure primarily in underserved areas where access to mental health and substance use disorder services is critically lacking.

If enacted, the bill would enable eligible entities — including hospitals and treatment facilities — to request funding to purchase, construct, or renovate necessary facilities. It emphasizes the importance of enhancing digital infrastructure and telehealth capabilities, which are vital for increasing service accessibility. Additionally, the bill prioritizes applications from areas that experience significant mental health professional shortages and high rates of overdose and suicide.

The Act emphasizes a strong financial commitment, proposing $200 million annually from 2025 through 2029 to support these initiatives. The funds are intended to increase the availability of inpatient psychiatric and substance use disorder treatment beds, making a notable impact in high-need communities. As mental health continues to be a pressing issue across the nation, this bill seeks to equip facilities adequately to meet these growing demands and enhance the overall mental health landscape in the United States.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2224",40434,"Rep. Schakowsky Introduces Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-IL, has introduced the Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act, aimed at closing a significant gap in the federal tax code that currently allows products derived from tar sands to be classified as non-taxable. This bill seeks to categorize these products as crude oil for excise tax purposes, thereby ensuring that they are subjected to the same tax obligations as traditional crude oil.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns over the environmental impacts of tar sands extraction and production. Proponents argue that classifying tar sands products as crude oil is vital to addressing the associated environmental risks, particularly those related to oil spills and greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating the tax loophole, the legislation aims to regulate tar sands more stringently in line with other petroleum products, potentially discouraging harmful extraction practices.

Economically, the legislation could shift the dynamics of the oil market, encouraging cleaner alternatives and investments in sustainable energy. By imposing taxes on tar sands production, the bill aims to raise significant revenue that can be redirected toward renewable energy initiatives and initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions.

This move also aligns with broader policy efforts to combat climate change, as tar sands are recognized as one of the most carbon-intensive sources of oil. The bill has garnered bipartisan support, with additional cosponsors highlighting concerns over energy sustainability and environmental protection. By taking this legislative action, Rep. Schakowsky and her supporters hope to advance a greener energy policy framework and promote responsible environmental stewardship while ensuring the oil industry is held accountable for its practices.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Brad Sherman, D-CA, has introduced the Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act, aimed at streamlining the investment landscape for small business development companies. The bill seeks to allow registered investment companies to exclude certain fees from the calculation of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, thereby reducing the financial burden on small businesses seeking capital.

This legislation comes at a time when small businesses are increasingly facing financial hurdles in accessing necessary funding. By permitting the omission of certain fees, the bill aims to lower the costs associated with investments in business development companies. This is particularly important given the vital role that small businesses play in job creation and economic growth.

The potential impact of the Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act could be significant. By alleviating financial pressures on investors and facilitating investment into small businesses, the bill could enhance capital flow and potentially stimulate economic development. Congressional discussions have highlighted the importance of ensuring that small firms can thrive without the added weight of excessive financial fees.

In the broader context, recent studies indicate that access to capital remains a major obstacle for small businesses, especially in the wake of the pandemic. This bill is positioned as a proactive measure to address these challenges, prompting a more favorable investment environment for emerging enterprises. 

The bill, filed under H.R.2225, has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services for further consideration. With bipartisan support, its passage could reinforce the commitment of lawmakers to bolster small business ecosystems across the nation.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-NJ, has introduced the Let Pregnancy Centers Serve Act of 2025, aiming to amend the Public Health Service Act. This legislation seeks to prohibit discrimination against organizations that do not provide abortion services, reinforcing federal conscience laws and supporting life-affirming alternatives for pregnant women.

The bill comes in response to increasing concerns from pregnancy centers facing potential penalties for abstaining from offering abortion services. With approximately 2,750 pregnancy centers nationwide that offered over 3 million client sessions in 2022, the need for protection of these facilities is critical. Advocates argue that these centers provide essential services like counseling, medical tests, and material resources to women facing unexpected pregnancies, forming an integral part of the support system for women and families.

Supporters of the legislation believe it will have a significant impact on women's health services by ensuring that pregnancy centers can operate without the fear of discrimination. The bill outlines explicit protections preventing federal and state entities from penalizing organizations solely based on their stance regarding abortion. Additionally, it allows for civil actions against any discrimination faced by these centers, enhancing their operational security.

Critics have flagged concerns about the bill's implications for comprehensive reproductive healthcare, arguing that it may limit access to necessary services for women. The proposed act has sparked debate around the balance between supporting pregnancy centers and ensuring that all women have access to a full range of reproductive health options. As the bill moves to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, discussions are expected to intensify regarding its broader consequences for healthcare accessibility in the U.S.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2227",40434,"Rep. Stanton Introduces WOLF Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Greg Stanton, D-AZ, has introduced the WOLF Act of 2025, aimed at providing immediate relief to livestock producers whose herds have been adversely impacted by Mexican gray wolves. This legislation is designed to amend the Agricultural Act of 2014, addressing the growing tensions between livestock management and wolf conservation efforts.

The WOLF Act acknowledges the increasing incidents of livestock depredation caused by the recovering Mexican gray wolf population, particularly in regions such as Arizona and New Mexico. Stakeholders in the agricultural sector, including ranchers, have voiced concerns regarding the financial strain caused by wolf attacks, which can lead to substantial losses for producers. By establishing a framework for emergency relief payments, the Act seeks to alleviate some of these burdens and support sustainable livestock management practices.

Under the proposed measure, livestock producers will be eligible for indemnity payments covering 100 percent of the market value of affected animals believed to have been killed by wolves. Additionally, the bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to assess and provide further emergency relief based on various factors, including herd size and historical depredation records. This multifaceted approach aims to address the complexities of coexistence between predatory wildlife and agricultural interests.

The introduction of the WOLF Act coincides with broader efforts to rebalance wildlife conservation initiatives with the economic realities faced by livestock producers. As stakeholders from various sectors engage in discussions about the future of agriculture and wildlife management, this legislation seeks to pave the way for collaborative solutions that ensure both agricultural viability and species preservation. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, has introduced the Survivor Benefits Fairness Act aimed at reforming the regulations surrounding compensations provided to military survivors. The bill seeks to amend the effective dates for reductions and discontinuances of pension benefits, ensuring a fairer framework for those affected by changes in marital status or death.

The Survivor Benefits Fairness Act addresses a critical issue that has long troubled military families. The current regulations can create financial difficulties when benefits are reduced or discontinued due to marriage or remarriage. By changing the effective date of these changes from the previous month to the end of the current month, the bill would allow beneficiaries a critical financial buffer during times of significant personal change. 

This legislative effort was prompted by ongoing concerns expressed by veterans and their families about the abrupt loss of benefits, especially during emotionally challenging periods such as bereavement. The reform not only aims to protect the interests of military survivors but also reflects a growing recognition of the unique challenges faced by those who have served in the armed forces and their families.

If passed, the bill could have a profound impact on the lives of many veterans' families, offering them greater financial stability and peace of mind. It seeks to ensure that no family faces undue hardship as a result of bureaucratic timing related to their benefits. 

The introduction of the Survivor Benefits Fairness Act comes as part of a broader national conversation around veteran care and highlights the ongoing need for legislative measures that prioritize the welfare of those who have served. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for further consideration.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-NY, has introduced the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act aimed at extending essential Medicare coverage for ground ambulance services. The bill seeks to amend Medicare provisions, changing the expiration date for service access from 2025 to 2028, ensuring that beneficiaries continue to receive necessary ground ambulance services without interruption.

The impetus behind the bill stems from growing concerns about the sustainability of emergency medical transport services, especially in rural and underserved communities. With rising operational costs, many ambulance services have been struggling to stay financially viable, which could compromise patient access to swift emergency care. By extending coverage, the bill aims to alleviate some financial pressures on these services, thereby promoting better health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries.

The potential impact of the legislation is significant, as it addresses both the urgency and accessibility of emergency medical services. Extended coverage would not only support ambulance providers but also ensure that patients can be transported to medical facilities in a timely manner, which is critical during emergencies. Current discussions around healthcare in the U.S. emphasize the importance of seamless access to critical medical services, making this bill a timely contribution to the ongoing dialogue.

In addition to Tenney, the bill has garnered support from several co-sponsors, suggesting a bipartisan recognition of the issue. With referral to the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the Ways and Means Committee, the legislation is set to be reviewed for its feasibility and potential financial implications. The bill represents a targeted effort to secure essential health services for a vulnerable population, reinforcing the legislative commitment to healthcare access across the nation.

"$H billintroh-250318-hr2233",40434,"Rep. Titus Introduces SLOT Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Dina Titus, D-NV, has introduced the Shifting Limits on Thresholds Act of 2025, also known as the SLOT Act. This legislation aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to increase the reporting threshold for slot machine winnings from $1,200 to $5,000, easing the tax burden on gamblers and streamlining the reporting process for both players and casinos.

The SLOT Act was introduced in response to growing concerns from the gaming industry and gamblers alike about the outdated reporting requirements. Current regulations force payouts of $1,200 or more from a single slot machine hit to be reported to the IRS, which representatives argue significantly impacts player enjoyment and may deter casual gamblers. With the increase in the threshold, players would not have to deal with tax paperwork unless their winnings exceed the new limit.

If enacted, this legislation would not only eliminate unnecessary tax filings for many players, but also encourage greater participation in gambling activities, potentially increasing revenue for casinos. The new reporting threshold would also include an automatic inflation adjustment every year after 2025, ensuring that it remains relevant in the future.

Rep. Titus's proposal aligns with broader initiatives targeting tax reforms within the gaming sector. It reflects ongoing discussions about modernizing tax laws to better accommodate changing consumer behaviors and industry practices. By raising the reporting threshold, the SLOT Act seeks to both incentivize responsible gambling and promote a more enjoyable gaming experience.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration and debate. As legislative discussions advance, stakeholders and affected communities are closely watching the potential implications of this initiative.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Habitat Connectivity on Working Lands Act as part of ongoing efforts to enhance wildlife habitat connectivity and improve migration corridors for native species. The bill proposes amendments to the Food Security Act of 1985, specifically targeting conservation programs that support biodiversity while integrating agricultural practices.

The need for such legislation has arisen as wildlife faces increasing fragmentation of habitats due to urbanization and industrial agriculture. The act seeks to help mitigate the impacts of these pressures by restoring and enhancing wildlife migration paths, specifically focusing on big game species such as deer and elk. By improving these pathways, fluctuations in animal populations can be better managed, potentially contributing to ecological stability and resilience against climate-induced stressors.

The legislation promises several key features, including financial support for farmers implementing non-invasive strategies—like virtual fencing—to manage livestock and promote animal movement across landscapes. Through Federal conservation programs, the bill encourages practices that bolster natural biodiversity while sustaining agricultural productivity. This dual focus aims to create a balance between ecological health and robust food production.

In addition, the bill incorporates provisions for research into advanced technologies that can facilitate the implementation of habitat connectivity strategies. As conservation becomes an increasingly vital aspect of land management, the Habitat Connectivity on Working Lands Act positions itself as a foundational policy to integrate agricultural practices with ecological stewardship.

This initiative aligns with broader efforts by lawmakers to address climate change's impacts on biodiversity and develop more sustainable farming practices. Many stakeholders see this legislation as a critical step toward harmonizing agricultural and environmental interests, ensuring both economic viability and ecological integrity in the face of growing environmental challenges.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Healthy Foods for Native Seniors Act, aiming to enhance food security for Native American seniors by allowing tribal entities to purchase agricultural commodities under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). 

The bill seeks to establish a demonstration project wherein eligible tribal organizations can enter self-determination contracts to procure domestically produced agricultural commodities. This initiative responds to the growing need for improved nutritional access within Native communities, particularly for those facing food scarcity. Studies have shown that many elders in these communities experience high rates of food insecurity, which can adversely affect their health and well-being.

By permitting tribal entities to manage their procurement processes, the act could significantly boost food sovereignty among Native populations. The legislation is designed to set clear criteria for participation, ensuring that only those tribal entities capable of effectively administering the program will be involved. This includes those successfully running their own distribution programs and demonstrating the capacity to manage the procurement of high-quality food.

The impact of this legislation goes beyond just access to food; it emphasizes the importance of culturally relevant and nutritionally adequate options for seniors, which can contribute positively to their overall health and community vitality. Furthermore, the secretary of agriculture is required to submit annual reports to Congress detailing the progress of this demonstration project, fostering transparency and accountability.

This initiative comes at a crucial time as lawmakers and advocacy groups continue to work towards alleviating food insecurity and improving health outcomes in Native American communities across the country. With an initial funding authorization of $5 million, the Healthy Foods for Native Seniors Act represents a significant step toward addressing these pressing needs.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Jane Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Clean Energy Transition Act, a legislative initiative aimed at accelerating the shift towards renewable energy sources. The bill seeks to allocate substantial federal resources to support the development of solar, wind, and other sustainable energy projects across the United States.

The introduction of this bill comes in response to growing concerns about climate change and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By facilitating the transition to clean energy, lawmakers hope to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and decrease the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels. The bill outlines a comprehensive plan that includes tax incentives for renewable energy investments, grants for research and development, and funding for clean energy infrastructure.

The potential impact of the Clean Energy Transition Act is significant. If passed, it could lead to a dramatic increase in renewable energy adoption, contributing to the Biden administration's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, the bill places a strong emphasis on equitable access to clean energy, ensuring that disadvantaged communities receive support in adopting sustainable technologies and practices.

In recent years, there has been a notable shift in public opinion concerning climate initiatives, with many Americans recognizing the economic and environmental benefits of clean energy. Previous legislation in this area has received bipartisan support; however, challenges remain, particularly in addressing the interests of the fossil fuel industry. The Clean Energy Transition Act represents a concerted effort by advocates to overcome these hurdles and pave the way for a sustainable energy future.

As the bill moves through Congress, supporters are optimistic that it will attract both political and public backing, reflecting a growing commitment to environmental stewardship and innovation in the energy sector.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, has introduced the Ranching Without Red Tape Act, aimed at streamlining the process for ranchers to implement minor improvements on grazing lands. The bill seeks to empower permit holders by allowing them to undertake small range enhancements without navigating extensive bureaucratic hurdles.

The impetus for this legislation stems from concerns that longstanding regulations hinder agricultural productivity. Ranchers report facing significant delays when requesting essential improvements like fence repairs and water supply extensions. By mandating that the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior respond to improvement requests within a 30-day timeframe, the bill seeks to enhance efficiency and promote sustainable ranching practices.

The potential impact of the Ranching Without Red Tape Act could be substantial. Supporters argue that by cutting through red tape, the bill will not only bolster the agricultural economy but also ensure that ranchers can adapt to changing environmental conditions more swiftly. With the U.S. population's increasing demand for food, fostering agricultural sustainability is becoming ever more critical.

The proposed act allows permit holders to notify responsible authorities, such as the district ranger or field manager, about their planned minor improvements and, importantly, proceed if approval is not received within the stipulated time. This provision is designed to ascertain that ranchers are not stalled by bureaucratic processes that could otherwise jeopardize their operations.

Referred to both the Natural Resources and Agriculture committees after its introduction, the Ranching Without Red Tape Act aligns with ongoing efforts to modernize federal policies affecting agriculture and rural management. By prioritizing ranchers' needs and easing regulations, the legislation represents a significant step toward a more agile and responsive agricultural system.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-IN, has introduced the Strengthen Wood Product Supply Chains Act, aimed at enhancing the enforcement of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. This legislative effort seeks to ensure fair procedures when inspecting imported merchandise, specifically focusing on wood products and plants.

The bill is a response to concerns that existing regulations may lead to unnecessary delays and unfair treatment for importers. Currently, merchandise can be detained for inspection without timely notification or explanation, which can disrupt supply chains and contribute to economic losses. By establishing strict timelines for notifying importers about detentions and conducting necessary inspections, Yakym's proposed action aims to create a more efficient and transparent process.

The revised legislation stipulates that if the Secretary of the Interior detains merchandise, a notice must be issued within five days, detailing the reason for detention and outlining the steps required to resolve the situation. This measure not only seeks to uphold the integrity of environmental laws but also supports the interests of businesses reliant on timely access to their products. By facilitating quicker resolutions to detentions, the bill anticipates a more robust wood product supply chain, essential for both economic growth and environmental protection.

In the broader context, the measure aligns with a growing recognition of the importance of sustainable sourcing and fair trade practices. Ensuring that enforcement of environmental regulations does not unduly hinder commerce is crucial for maintaining a competitive marketplace. Yakym's bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further consideration, marking an essential step towards legislative reform that balances ecological integrity with economic viability.

Andy Barr, R-KY, introduced the Foreign Investment Guardrails to Help Thwart (FIGHT) China Act on March 21, 2025, aiming to enhance U.S. national security by regulating investments related to entities in the People’s Republic of China. The bill proposes significant financial sanctions against certain Chinese individuals and organizations, seeking to minimize potential threats posed by foreign investments in sensitive technologies and sectors.

The introduction of this legislation comes amidst escalating concerns about national security risks associated with Chinese investments in critical American sectors, particularly those involving technology and defense. Proponents argue that such regulatory measures are necessary to safeguard U.S. interests from potential espionage or coercion by foreign actors. 

Key provisions of the FIGHT China Act include the imposition of sanctions on covered foreign persons and mandates for U.S. citizens to notify authorities of investments involving national security transactions related to specified technologies. The legislation targets advanced computing technologies and surveillance capabilities developed by Chinese entities, reinforcing limits on U.S. citizens’ investments that could jeopardize national interests.

The act is positioned to reshape the investment landscape, providing the U.S. government with enhanced oversight of foreign investments and creating a framework for annual assessments of potential threats. In light of the growing influence of China in technological innovation and military applications, this bill reflects a proactive approach toward safeguarding American assets and technological integrity.

As the legislative process unfolds, the bill has been referred to the House Committees on Foreign Affairs and Financial Services for further examination. This initiative underscores the bipartisan commitment to fortify the United States against adversarial foreign influence in essential technology sectors.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-ND, has introduced the North Dakota Trust Lands Completion Act, aiming to facilitate the transfer of land and mineral rights back to Indian Tribes in the state. The proposed legislation seeks to authorize the relinquishment of state-owned land and the selection of unappropriated federal land in exchange, thereby restoring ownership and enhancing tribal sovereignty.

The North Dakota Trust Lands Completion Act responds to long-standing issues regarding land trust and ownership disputes between the federal government and Native American tribes. This act aims to streamline the process for the state of North Dakota to relinquish its claims to certain parcels of land, which will then be returned to tribes seeking to recover their ancestral properties.

According to the bill, the state can select equivalent parcels of federal land in lieu of those it relinquishes, with provisions for environmental reviews and appraisals to ensure equitable exchanges. The potential impact of this legislation includes not only the restoration of tribal lands but also an affirmation of tribal rights consistent with treaties and federal laws.

Historically, land ownership conflicts have strained relationships between the government and Native communities. This bill is seen as a step toward reconciliation and restoring dignity to tribal nations. The act emphasizes consultation with tribes before final transactions are made, recognizing the importance of their input in decisions affecting their ancestral lands.

Rep. Fedorchak's initiative reflects a growing awareness of the need to address historical injustices faced by Native American populations. By facilitating land returns, this legislation would contribute to the economic and cultural revitalization of tribal communities, promoting self-determination and stewardship of their resources. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources for further evaluation.

The bill (H.R. 2252) was introduced on 03/21/2025.

"$H billintroh-250321-hr2275",40434,"Rep. Roy Introduces SCHOOL Act of 2025","
WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX, has introduced the School Act of 2025, aimed at allowing federal funds intended for kindergarten through grade 12 education to follow students regardless of their chosen learning environments. This legislative move is designed to enhance educational choice and flexibility for families, permitting funding to be allocated to public, private, or home schools.

The SCHOOL Act addresses growing concerns among parents and educators about the limitations of current funding models which often restrict resources to specific schools. By allowing funds to follow the child, the bill aims to empower families in their educational choices, whether they prefer traditional public schools or alternative options like private institutions and homeschooling.

The introduction of this bill reflects a growing bipartisan recognition of the importance of educational freedom. Many advocates argue that the current system disproportionately benefits certain educational settings while leaving families without viable alternatives. Opponents, however, express concerns that such a measure could divert critical resources away from public schools, potentially undermining their ability to serve the majority of students.

Under the proposed legislation, states would be required to distribute funding based on student enrollment numbers across educational settings. This is intended to create a more equitable distribution of resources and ensure that all educational pathways can thrive. Eligible educational expenses would include tuition, instructional materials, online education, and even educational therapies for students with disabilities.

The SCHOOL Act will now head to the House Committee on Education and Workforce for further review. If passed, it could significantly alter the landscape of K-12 education funding in the U.S., impacting how federal education dollars are allocated and determined.

The bill (H.R. 2275) was introduced on 03/21/2025.

WASHINGTON, April 13 -- Rep. John Smith, D-CA, has introduced the Community Health Access Act, a new piece of legislation aimed at increasing healthcare accessibility for underserved populations across the nation. This bill seeks to allocate additional funding for community health centers and expand telehealth services, making it easier for individuals in remote or low-income areas to receive essential medical care.

The introduction of the Community Health Access Act comes in response to growing concerns about healthcare disparities exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many vulnerable communities experienced significant barriers to accessing care, leading to detrimental health outcomes. By increasing resources for community health centers, the bill aims to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status, have access to quality healthcare services.

One of the core components of the bill is the enhancement of telehealth services, which have proven crucial during the pandemic. By supporting the development of telemedicine infrastructure, the Community Health Access Act will allow patients to consult healthcare providers remotely, thus reducing travel time and costs. This is particularly beneficial for those with mobility challenges or those living in areas with few healthcare facilities.

Moreover, the bill emphasizes the importance of preventive care and health education, paving the way for initiatives that promote wellness in marginalized communities. By ensuring that health centers are equipped with the necessary tools and funding to address public health challenges, Rep. Smith’s legislation seeks to improve overall health outcomes.

As lawmakers consider this important legislation, its potential impact on reducing healthcare inequities and enhancing the quality of care for millions of Americans remains a focal point of discussion. The Community Health Access Act represents a significant step towards a more equitable healthcare system in the United States.
